A HUNDREDWEIGHT OF STONES

June 16, 1778

The forest between Philadelphia and Valley Forge

IAN MURRAY STOOD with a stone in his hand, eyeing the ground heâ€™d chosen. A small clearing, out of the way, up among a scatter of great lichened boulders, under the shadow of firs and at the foot of a big red cedar; a place where no casual passerby would go, but not inaccessible. He meant to bring them up hereâ€”the family.

Fergus, to begin with. Maybe just Fergus, by himself. Mam had raised Fergus from the time he was ten, and heâ€™d had no mother before that. Fergus had known Mam longer than Ian had, and loved her as much. Maybe more, he thought, his grief aggravated by guilt. Fergus had stayed with her at Lally-broch, helped to take care of her and the place; he hadnâ€™t. He swallowed hard and, walking into the small clear space, set his stone in the middle, then stood back to look.

Even as he did so, he found himself shaking his head. No, it had to be two cairns. His mam and Uncle Jamie were brother and sister, and the family could mourn them here togetherâ€”but there were others he might bring, maybe, to remember and pay their respects. And those were the folk who would have known Jamie Fraser and loved him well but wouldnâ€™t ken Jenny Murray from a hole in theâ€”

The image of his mother in a hole in the ground stabbed him like a fork, retreated with the recollection that she wasnâ€™t after all in a grave, and stabbed again all the harder for that. He really couldnâ€™t bear the vision of them drowning, maybe clinging to each other, struggling to keepâ€”

â€œA Dhia!â€ he said violently, and dropped the stone, turning back at once to find more. Heâ€™d seen people drown.

Tears ran down his face with the sweat of the summer day; he didnâ€™t mind it, only stopping now and then to wipe his nose on his sleeve. Heâ€™d tied a rolled kerchief round his head to keep the hair and the stinging sweat out of his eyes; it was sopping before heâ€™d added more than twenty stones to each of the cairns.

He and his brothers had built a fine cairn for their father before he died, at the head of the carved stone that bore his nameâ€”all his names, in spite of the expenseâ€”in the burying ground at Lallybroch. And then later, at the funeral, members of the family, followed by the tenants and then the servants, had come one by one to add a stone each to the weight of remembrance.



Fergus, then. Or . . . no, what was he thinking? Auntie Claire must be the first he brought here. She wasnâ€™t Scots herself, but she kent fine what a cairn was and would maybe be comforted a bit to see Uncle Jamieâ€™s. Aye, right. Auntie Claire, then Fergus. Uncle Jamie was Fergusâ€™s foster father; he had a right. And then maybe Marsali and the children. But maybe Germain was old enough to come with Fergus? He was ten, near enough to being a man to understand, to be treated like a man. And Uncle Jamie was his grandsire; it was proper.

He stepped back again and wiped his face, breathing heavily. Bugs whined and buzzed past his ears and hovered over him, wanting his blood, but heâ€™d stripped to a loincloth and rubbed himself with bear grease and mint in the Mohawk way; they didnâ€™t touch him.

â€œLook over them, O spirit of red cedar,â€ he said softly in Mohawk, gazing up into the fragrant branches of the tree. â€œGuard their souls and keep their presence here, fresh as thy branches.â€

He crossed himself and bent to dig about in the soft leaf mold. A few more rocks, he thought. In case they might be scattered by some passing animal. Scattered like his thoughts, which roamed restless to and fro among the faces of his family, the folk of the Ridgeâ€”God, might he ever go back there? Brianna. Oh, Jesus, Brianna . . .

He bit his lip and tasted salt, licked it away and moved on, foraging. She was safe with Roger Mac and the weans. But, Jesus, he could have used her adviceâ€”even more, Roger Macâ€™s.

Who was left for him to ask, if he needed help in taking care of them all?

Thought of Rachel came to him, and the tightness in his chest eased a little. Aye, if he had Rachel . . . She was younger than him, nay more than nineteen, and, being a Quaker, had very strange notions of how things should be, but if he had her, heâ€™d have solid rock under his feet. He hoped he would have her, but there were still things he must say to her, and the thought of that conversation made the tightness in his chest come back.

The picture of his cousin Brianna came back, too, and lingered in his mind: tall, long-nosed and strong-boned as her father . . . and with it rose the image of his other cousin, Breeâ€™s half brother. Holy God, William. And what ought he to do about William? He doubted the man kent the truth, kent that he was Jamie Fraserâ€™s sonâ€”was it Ianâ€™s responsibility to tell him so? To bring him here and explain what heâ€™d lost?

He must have groaned at the thought, for his dog, Rollo, lifted his massive head and looked at him in concern.

â€œNo, I dinna ken that, either,â€ Ian told him. â€œLet it bide, aye?â€ Rollo laid his head back on his paws, shivered his shaggy hide against the flies, and relaxed in boneless peace.

Ian worked awhile longer and let the thoughts drain away with his sweat and his tears. He finally stopped when the sinking sun touched the tops of his cairns, feeling tired but more at peace. The cairns rose knee-high, side by side, small but solid.

He stood still for a bit, not thinking anymore, just listening to the fussing of wee birds in the grass and the breathing of the wind among the trees. Then he sighed deeply, squatted, and touched one of the cairns.

â€œTha gaol agam oirbh, a MhÃ thair,â€ he said softly. My love is upon you, Mother. Closed his eyes and laid a scuffed hand on the other heap of stones. The dirt ground into his skin made his fingers feel strange, as though he could maybe reach straight through the earth and touch what he needed.

He stayed still, breathing, then opened his eyes.

â€œHelp me wiâ€™ this, Uncle Jamie,â€ he said. â€œI dinna think I can manage, alone.â€





DIRTY BASTARD

WILLIAM RANSOM, Ninth Earl of Ellesmere, Viscount Ashness, Baron Derwent, shoved his way through the crowds on Market Street, oblivious to the complaints of those rebounding from his impact.

He didnâ€™t know where he was going, or what he might do when he got there. All he knew was that heâ€™d burst if he stood still.

His head throbbed like an inflamed boil. Everything throbbed. His handâ€”heâ€™d probably broken something, but he didnâ€™t care. His heart, pounding and sore inside his chest. His foot, for Godâ€™s sakeâ€”what, had he kicked something? He lashed out viciously at a loose cobblestone and sent it rocketing through a crowd of geese, who set up a huge cackle and lunged at him, hissing and beating at his shins with their wings.

Feathers and goose shit flew wide, and the crowd scattered in all directions.

â€œBastard!â€ shrieked the goose-girl, and struck at him with her crook, catching him a shrewd thump on the ear. â€œDevil take you, dreckiger Bastard!â€

This sentiment was echoed by a number of other angry voices, and he veered into an alley, pursued by shouts and honks of agitation.

He rubbed his throbbing ear, lurching into buildings as he passed, oblivious to everything but the one word throbbing ever louder in his head. Bastard.

â€œBastard!â€ he said out loud, and shouted, â€œBastard, bastard, bastard!â€ at the top of his lungs, hammering at the brick wall next to him with a clenched fist.

â€œWhoâ€™s a bastard?â€ said a curious voice behind him. He swung round to see a young woman looking at him with some interest. Her eyes moved slowly down his frame, taking note of the heaving chest, the bloodstains on the facings of his uniform coat, and the green smears of goose shit on his breeches. Her gaze reached his silver-buckled shoes and returned to his face with more interest.

â€œI am,â€ he said, hoarse and bitter.

â€œOh, really?â€ She left the shelter of the doorway in which sheâ€™d been lingering and came across the alley to stand right in front of him. She was tall and slim and had a very fine pair of high young breastsâ€”which were clearly visible under the thin muslin of her shift, because, while she had a silk petticoat, she wore no stays. No cap, eitherâ€”her hair fell loose over her shoulders. A whore.

â€œIâ€™m partial to bastards myself,â€ she said, and touched him lightly on the arm. â€œWhat kind of bastard are you? A wicked one? An evil one?â€

â€œA sorry one,â€ he said, and scowled when she laughed. She saw the scowl but didnâ€™t pull back.

â€œCome in,â€ she said, and took his hand. â€œYou look as though you could do with a drink.â€ He saw her glance at his knuckles, burst and bleeding, and she caught her lower lip behind small white teeth. She didnâ€™t seem afraid, though, and he found himself drawn, unprotesting, into the shadowed doorway after her.

What did it matter? he thought, with a sudden savage weariness. What did anything matter?





IN WHICH THE WOMEN, AS USUAL, PICK UP THE PIECES

Number 17 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia

The residence of Lord and Lady John Grey

WILLIAM HAD LEFT the house like a thunderclap, and the place looked as though it had been struck by lightning. I certainly felt like the survivor of a massive electrical storm, hairs and nerve endings all standing up straight on end, waving in agitation.

Jenny Murray had entered the house on the heels of Williamâ€™s departure, and while the sight of her was a lesser shock than any of the others so far, it still left me speechless. I goggled at my erstwhile sister-in-lawâ€”though, come to think, she still was my sister-in-law . . . because Jamie was alive. Alive.

Heâ€™d been in my arms not ten minutes before, and the memory of his touch flickered through me like lightning in a bottle. I was dimly aware that I was smiling like a loon, despite massive destruction, horrific scenes, Williamâ€™s distressâ€”if you could call an explosion like that â€œdistressâ€â€”Jamieâ€™s danger, and a faint wonder as to what either Jenny or Mrs. Figg, Lord Johnâ€™s cook and housekeeper, might be about to say.

Mrs. Figg was smoothly spherical, gleamingly black, and inclined to glide silently up behind one like a menacing ball bearing.

â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€ she barked, manifesting herself suddenly behind Jenny.

â€œHoly Mother of God!â€ Jenny whirled, eyes round and hand pressed to her chest. â€œWho in Godâ€™s name are you?â€

â€œThis is Mrs. Figg,â€ I said, feeling a surreal urge to laugh, despiteâ€”or maybe because ofâ€”recent events. â€œLord John Greyâ€™s cook. And, Mrs. Figg, this is Mrs. Murray. My, um . . . my . . .â€

â€œYour good-sister,â€ Jenny said firmly. She raised one black eyebrow. â€œIf yeâ€™ll have me still?â€ Her look was straight and open, and the urge to laugh changed abruptly into an equally strong urge to burst into tears. Of all the unlikely sources of succor I could have imagined . . . I took a deep breath and put out my hand.

â€œIâ€™ll have you.â€ We hadnâ€™t parted on good terms in Scotland, but I had loved her very much, once, and wasnâ€™t about to pass up any opportunity to mend things.

Her small firm fingers wove through mine, squeezed hard, and, as simply as that, it was done. No need for apologies or spoken forgiveness. Sheâ€™d never had to wear the mask that Jamie did. What she thought and felt was there in her eyes, those slanted blue cat eyes she shared with her brother. She knew the truth now of what I was, and she knew I lovedâ€”and always had lovedâ€”her brother with all my heart and soulâ€”despite the minor complications of my being presently married to someone else.

She heaved a sigh, eyes closing for an instant, then opened them and smiled at me, mouth trembling only a little.

â€œWell, fine and dandy,â€ said Mrs. Figg shortly. She narrowed her eyes and rotated smoothly on her axis, taking in the panorama of destruction. The railing at the top of the stair had been ripped off, and cracked banisters, dented walls, and bloody smudges marked the path of Williamâ€™s descent. Shattered crystals from the chandelier littered the floor, glinting festively in the light that poured through the open front door, the door itself cracked through and hanging drunkenly from one hinge.

â€œMerde on toast,â€ Mrs. Figg murmured. She turned abruptly to me, her small black-currant eyes still narrowed. â€œWhereâ€™s his lordship?â€

â€œAh,â€ I said. This was going to be rather sticky, I saw. While deeply disapproving of most people, Mrs. Figg was devoted to John. She wasnâ€™t going to be at all pleased to hear that heâ€™d been abducted byâ€”

â€œFor that matter, whereâ€™s my brother?â€ Jenny inquired, glancing round as though expecting Jamie to appear suddenly out from under the settee.



â€œOh,â€ I said. â€œHmm. Well . . .â€ Possibly worse than sticky. Because . . .

â€œAnd whereâ€™s my Sweet William?â€ Mrs. Figg demanded, sniffing the air. â€œHeâ€™s been here; I smell that stinky cologne he puts on his linen.â€ She nudged a dislodged chunk of plaster disapprovingly with the toe of her shoe.

I took another long, deep breath and a tight grip on what remained of my sanity.

â€œMrs. Figg,â€ I said, â€œperhaps you would be so kind as to make us all a cup of tea?â€



WE SAT IN the parlor, while Mrs. Figg came and went to the cookhouse, keeping an eye on her terrapin stew.

â€œYou donâ€™t want to scorch turtle, no, you donâ€™t,â€ she said severely to us, setting down the teapot in its padded yellow cozy on her return. â€œNot with so much sherry as his lordship likes in it. Almost a full bottleâ€”terrible waste of good liquor, that would be.â€

My insides turned over promptly. Turtle soupâ€”with a lot of sherryâ€”had certain strong and private associations for me, these being connected with Jamie, feverish delirium, and the way in which a heaving ship assists sexual intercourse. Contemplation of which would not assist the impending discussion in the slightest. I rubbed a finger between my brows, in hopes of dispelling the buzzing cloud of confusion gathering there. The air in the house still felt electric.

â€œSpeaking of sherry,â€ I said, â€œor any other sort of strong spirits you might have convenient, Mrs. Figg . . .â€

She looked thoughtfully at me, nodded, and reached for the decanter on the sideboard.

â€œBrandy is stronger,â€ she said, and set it in front of me.

Jenny looked at me with the same thoughtfulness and, reaching out, poured a good-sized slug of the brandy into my cup, then a similar one into her own.

â€œJust in case,â€ she said, raising one brow, and we drank for a few moments. I thought it might take something stronger than brandy-laced tea to deal with the effect of recent events on my nervesâ€”laudanum, say, or a large slug of straight Scotch whiskyâ€”but the tea undeniably helped, hot and aromatic, settling in a soft trickling warmth amidships.

â€œSo, then. Weâ€™re fettled, are we?â€ Jenny set down her own cup and looked expectant.

â€œItâ€™s a start.â€ I took a deep breath and gave her a prÃ©cis of the morningâ€™s events.

Jennyâ€™s eyes were disturbingly like Jamieâ€™s. She blinked at me once, then twice, and shook her head as though to clear it, accepting what Iâ€™d just told her.

â€œSo Jamieâ€™s gone off wiâ€™ your Lord John, the British army is after them, the tall lad I met on the stoop wiâ€™ steam cominâ€™ out of his ears is Jamieâ€™s sonâ€”well, of course he is; a blind man could see thatâ€”and the townâ€™s aboil wiâ€™ British soldiers. Is that it, then?â€



â€œHeâ€™s not exactly my Lord John,â€ I said. â€œBut, yes, thatâ€™s essentially the position. I take it Jamie told you about William, then?â€

â€œAye, he did.â€ She grinned at me over the rim of her teacup. â€œIâ€™m that happy for him. But whatâ€™s troubling his lad, then? He looked like he wouldna give the road to a bear.â€

â€œWhat did you say?â€ Mrs. Figgâ€™s voice cut in abruptly. She set down the tray she had just brought in, the silver milk jug and sugar basin rattling like castanets. â€œWilliam is whose son?â€

I took a fortifying gulp of tea. Mrs. Figg did know that Iâ€™d been married toâ€”and theoretically widowed fromâ€”one James Fraser. But that was all she knew.

â€œWell,â€ I said, and paused to clear my throat. â€œThe, um, tall gentleman with the red hair who was just hereâ€”you saw him?â€

â€œI did.â€ Mrs. Figg eyed me narrowly.

â€œDid you get a good look at him?â€

â€œDidnâ€™t pay much heed to his face when he came to the door and asked where you were, but I saw his backside pretty plain when he pushed past me and ran up the stairs.â€

â€œPossibly the resemblance is less marked from that angle.â€ I took another mouthful of tea. â€œUm . . . that gentleman is James Fraser, my . . . er . . . myâ€”â€ â€œFirst husbandâ€ wasnâ€™t accurate, and neither was â€œlast husbandâ€â€”or even, unfortunately, â€œmost recent husband.â€ I settled for the simplest alternative. â€œMy husband. And, er . . . Williamâ€™s father.â€

Mrs. Figgâ€™s mouth opened, soundless for an instant. She backed up slowly and sat down on a needlework ottoman with a soft phumph.

â€œWilliam know that?â€ she asked, after a momentâ€™s contemplation.

â€œHe does now,â€ I said, with a brief gesture toward the devastation in the stairwell, clearly visible through the door of the parlor where we were sitting.

â€œMerde onâ€”I mean, Holy Lamb of God preserve us.â€ Mrs. Figgâ€™s second husband was a Methodist preacher, and she strove to be a credit to him, but her first had been a French gambler. Her eyes fixed on me like gun sights.

â€œYou his mother?â€

I choked on my tea.

â€œNo,â€ I said, wiping my chin with a linen napkin. â€œIt isnâ€™t quite that complicated.â€ In fact, it was more so, but I wasnâ€™t going to explain just how Willie had come about, either to Mrs. Figg or to Jenny. Jamie had to have told Jenny who Williamâ€™s mother was, but I doubted that heâ€™d told his sister that Williamâ€™s mother, Geneva Dunsany, had forced him into her bed by threatening Jennyâ€™s family. No man of spirit likes to admit that heâ€™s been effectively blackmailed by an eighteen-year-old girl.

â€œLord John became Williamâ€™s legal guardian when Williamâ€™s grandfather died, and at that point, Lord John also married Lady Isobel Dunsany, Willieâ€™s motherâ€™s sister. Sheâ€™d looked after Willie since his motherâ€™s death in childbirth, and she and Lord John were essentially Willieâ€™s parents since he was quite young. Isobel died when he was eleven or so.â€

Mrs. Figg took this explanation in stride but wasnâ€™t about to be distracted from the main point at issue.

â€œJames Fraser,â€ she said, tapping a couple of broad fingers on her knee and looking accusingly at Jenny. â€œHow comes he not to be dead? News was he drowned.â€ She cut her eyes at me. â€œI thought his lordship was like to throw himself in the harbor, too, when he heard it.â€

I closed my own eyes with a sudden shudder, the salt-cold horror of that news washing over me in a wave of memory. Even with Jamieâ€™s touch still joyful on my skin and the knowledge of him glowing in my heart, I relived the crushing pain of hearing that he was dead.

â€œWell, I can enlighten ye on that point, at least.â€

I opened my eyes to see Jenny drop a lump of sugar into her fresh tea and nod at Mrs. Figg. â€œWe were to take passage on a ship called Euterpeâ€”my brother and myselfâ€”out oâ€™ Brest. But the blackhearted thief of a captain sailed without us. Much good it did him,â€ she added, frowning.

Much good, indeed. The Euterpe had sunk in a storm in the Atlantic, lost with all hands. As Iâ€”and John Greyâ€”had been told.

â€œJamie found us another ship, but it landed us in Virginia, and weâ€™d to make our way up the coast, partly by wagon, partly by packet boat, keepinâ€™ out of the way of the soldiers. Those wee needles ye gave Jamie against the seasickness work a marvel,â€ she added, turning approvingly to me. â€œHe showed me how to put them in for him. But when we came to Philadelphia yesterday,â€ she went on, returning to her tale, â€œwe stole into the city by night, like a pair oâ€™ thieves, and made our way to Fergusâ€™s printshop. Lord, I thought my heart would stop a dozen times!â€

She smiled at the memory, and I was struck by the change in her. The shadow of sorrow still lay on her face, and she was thin and worn by travel, but the terrible strain of her husband Ianâ€™s long dying had lifted. There was color in her cheeks again and a brightness in her eyes that I had not seen since I had first known her thirty years before. She had found her peace, I thought, and felt a thankfulness that eased my own soul.

â€œ. . . so Jamie taps on the door at the back, and thereâ€™s no answer, though we can see the light of a fire cominâ€™ through the shutters. He knocks again, makinâ€™ a wee tune of itâ€”

â€ She rapped her knuckles lightly on the table, bump-ba-da-bump-ba-da-bump-bump-bump, and my heart turned over, recognizing the theme from The Lone Ranger, which Brianna had taught him.

â€œAnd after a moment,â€ Jenny went on, â€œa womanâ€™s voice calls out fierce, â€˜Whoâ€™s there?â€™ And Jamie says in the GÃ idhlig, â€˜It is your father, my daughter, and a cold, wet, and hungry man he is, too.â€™ For it was raininâ€™ hammer handles and pitchforks, and we were both soaked to the skin.â€

She rocked back a little, enjoying the telling.

â€œThe door opens then, just a crack, and thereâ€™s Marsali wiâ€™ a horse pistol in her hand, and her two wee lasses behind her, fierce as archangels, each with a billet of wood, ready to crack a thief across his shins. They see the firelight shine on Jamieâ€™s face then, and all three of them let out skellochs like to wake the dead and fall upon him and drag him inside and all talkinâ€™ at once and greetinâ€™, askinâ€™ was he a ghost and why was he not drowned, and that was the first we learned that the Euterpe had sunk.â€ She crossed herself. â€œGod rest them, poor souls,â€ she said, shaking her head.

I crossed myself, too, and saw Mrs. Figg look sideways at me; she hadnâ€™t realized I was a Papist.



â€œIâ€™ve come in, too, of course,â€ Jenny went on, â€œbut everyoneâ€™s talkinâ€™ at once and rushinâ€™ to and fro in search of dry clothes and hot drinks and Iâ€™m just lookinâ€™ about the place, for Iâ€™ve never been inside a printshop before, and the smell of the ink and the paper and lead is a wonder to me, and, sudden-like, thereâ€™s a tug at my skirt and this sweet-faced wee mannie says to me, â€˜And who are you, madame? Would you like some cider?â€™â€

â€œHenri-Christian,â€ I murmured, smiling at thought of Marsaliâ€™s youngest, and Jenny nodded.

â€œâ€˜Why, Iâ€™m your grannie Janet, son,â€™ says I, and his eyes go round, and he lets out a shriek and grabs me round the legs and gives me such a hug as to make me lose my balance and fall down on the settle. Iâ€™ve a bruise on my bum the size of your hand,â€ she added out of the corner of her mouth to me.

I felt a small knot of tension that I hadnâ€™t realized was there relax. Jenny did of course know that Henri-

Christian had been born a dwarfâ€”but knowing and seeing are sometimes different things. Clearly they hadnâ€™t been, for Jenny.

Mrs. Figg had been following this account with interest, but maintained her reserve. At mention of the printshop, though, this reserve hardened a bit.

â€œThese folkâ€”Marsali is your daughter, then, maâ€™am?â€ I could tell what she was thinking. The entire town of Philadelphia knew that Jamie was a Rebelâ€”and, by extension, so was I. It was the threat of my imminent arrest that had caused John to insist upon my marrying him in the wake of the tumult following Jamieâ€™s presumed death. The mention of printing in British-occupied Philadelphia was bound to raise questions as to just what was being printed, and by whom.

â€œNo, her husband is my brotherâ€™s adopted son,â€ Jenny explained. â€œBut I raised Fergus from a wee lad myself, so heâ€™s my foster son, as well, by the Highland way of reckoning.â€

Mrs. Figg blinked. She had been gamely trying to keep the cast of characters in some sort of order to this point, but now gave it up with a shake of her head that made the pink ribbons on her cap wave like antennae.

â€œWell, where the devilâ€”I mean, where on earth has your brother gone with his lordship?â€ she demanded. â€œTo this printshop, you think?â€

Jenny and I exchanged glances.

â€œI doubt it,â€ I said. â€œMore likely heâ€™s gone outside the city, using Johnâ€”er, his lordship, I meanâ€”as a hostage to get past the pickets, if necessary. Probably heâ€™ll let him go as soon as theyâ€™re far enough away for safety.â€

Mrs. Figg made a deep humming noise of disapproval.

â€œAnd maybe heâ€™ll make for Valley Forge and turn him over to the Rebels instead.â€

â€œOh, I shouldna think so,â€ Jenny said soothingly. â€œWhat would they want with him, after all?â€

Mrs. Figg blinked again, taken aback at the notion that anyone might not value his lordship to the same degree that she did, but after a momentâ€™s lip-pursing allowed as this might be so.

â€œHe wasnâ€™t in his uniform, was he, maâ€™am?â€ she asked me, brow furrowed. I shook my head. John didnâ€™t hold an active commission. He was a diplomat, though technically still lieutenant colonel of his brotherâ€™s regiment, and therefore wore his uniform for purposes of ceremony or intimidation, but he was officially retired from the army, not a combatant, and in plain clothes he would be taken as citizen rather than soldierâ€”thus of no particular interest to General Washingtonâ€™s troops at Valley Forge.

I didnâ€™t think Jamie was headed for Valley Forge in any case. I knew, with absolute certainty, that he would come back. Here. For me.

The thought bloomed low in my belly and spread upward in a wave of warmth that made me bury my nose in my teacup to hide the resulting flush.

Alive. I caressed the word, cradling it in the center of my heart. Jamie was alive. Glad as I was to see Jennyâ€”and gladder still to see her extend an olive branch in my directionâ€”I really wanted to go up to my room, close the door, and lean against the wall with my eyes shut tight, reliving the seconds after heâ€™d entered the room, when heâ€™d taken me in his arms and pressed me to the wall, kissing me, the simple, solid, warm fact of his presence so overwhelming that I might have collapsed onto the floor without that wallâ€™s support.

Alive, I repeated silently to myself. Heâ€™s alive.

Nothing else mattered. Though I did wonder briefly what heâ€™d done with John.





DONâ€™T ASK QUESTIONS YOU DONâ€™T WANT TO HEAR THE ANSWERS TO

In the woods,

an hourâ€™s ride outside Philadelphia

JOHN GREY HAD BEEN quite resigned to dying. Had expected it from the moment that heâ€™d blurted out, â€œI have had carnal knowledge of your wife.â€ The only question in his mind had been whether Fraser would shoot him, stab him, or eviscerate him with his bare hands.

To have the injured husband regard him calmly and say merely, â€œOh? Why?â€ was not merely unexpected but . . . infamous. Absolutely infamous.

â€œWhy?â€ John Grey repeated, incredulous. â€œDid you say â€˜Why?â€™â€

â€œI did. And I should appreciate an answer.â€

Now that Grey had both eyes open, he could see that Fraserâ€™s outward calm was not quite so impervious as heâ€™d first supposed. There was a pulse beating in Fraserâ€™s temple, and heâ€™d shifted his weight a little, like a man might do in the vicinity of a tavern brawl: not quite ready to commit violence but readying himself to meet it. Perversely, Grey found this sight steadying.

â€œWhat do you bloody mean, â€˜Whyâ€™?â€ he said, suddenly irritated. â€œAnd why arenâ€™t you fucking dead?â€

â€œI often wonder that myself,â€ Fraser replied politely. â€œI take it ye thought I was?â€

â€œYes, and so did your wife! Do you have the faintest idea what the knowledge of your death did to her?â€

The dark-blue eyes narrowed just a trifle.

â€œAre ye implying that the news of my death deranged her to such an extent that she lost her reason and took ye to her bed by force? Because,â€ he went on, neatly cutting off Greyâ€™s heated reply, â€œunless Iâ€™ve been seriously misled regarding your own nature, it would take substantial force to compel ye to any such action. Or am I wrong?â€

The eyes stayed narrow. Grey stared back at them. Then he closed his own eyes briefly and rubbed both hands hard over his face, like a man waking from a nightmare. He dropped his hands and opened his eyes again.

â€œYou are not misled,â€ he said, through clenched teeth. â€œAnd you are wrong.â€

Fraserâ€™s ruddy eyebrows shot upâ€”in genuine astonishment, Grey thought.

â€œYe went to her becauseâ€”from desire?â€ His voice rose, too. â€œAnd she let ye? I dinna believe it.â€

The color was creeping up Fraserâ€™s tanned neck, vivid as a climbing rose. Grey had seen that happen before and decided recklessly that the bestâ€”the onlyâ€”defense was to lose his own temper first. It was a relief.

â€œWe thought you were dead, you bloody arsehole!â€ he said, furious. â€œBoth of us! Dead! And weâ€”weâ€”took too much to drink one nightâ€”very much too much . . . We spoke of you . . . and . . . Damn you, neither one of us was making love to the otherâ€”we were both fucking you!â€

Fraserâ€™s face went abruptly blank and his jaw dropped. Grey enjoyed one split second of satisfaction at the sight, before a massive fist came up hard beneath his ribs and he hurtled backward, staggered a few steps farther, and fell. He lay in the leaves, completely winded, mouth opening and closing like an automatonâ€™s.

All right, then, he thought dimly. Bare hands it is.

The hands wrapped themselves in his shirt and jerked him to his feet. He managed to stand, and a wisp of air seeped into his lungs. Fraserâ€™s face was an inch from his. Fraser was in fact so close that Grey couldnâ€™t see the manâ€™s expressionâ€”only a close-up view of two bloodshot blue eyes, both of them berserk. That was enough. He felt quite calm now. It wouldnâ€™t take long.

â€œYou tell me exactly what happened, ye filthy wee pervert,â€ Fraser whispered, his breath hot on Greyâ€™s face and smelling of ale. He shook Grey slightly. â€œEvery word. Every motion. Everything.â€

Grey got just enough breath to answer.

â€œNo,â€ he said defiantly. â€œGo ahead and kill me.â€





FRASER SHOOK HIM violently, so that his teeth clacked painfully together and he bit his tongue. He made a strangled noise at this, and a blow he hadnâ€™t seen coming struck him in the left eye. He fell down again, his head exploding with fractured color and black dots, the smell of leaf mold pungent in his nose. Fraser yanked him up and set him on his feet once more, but then paused, presumably deciding how best to continue the process of vivisection.

What with the blood pounding in his ears and the rasp of Fraserâ€™s breath, Grey hadnâ€™t heard anything, but when he cautiously opened his good eye to see where the next blow was coming from, he saw the man. A rough-looking dirty thug, in a fringed hunting shirt, gawping stupidly from under a tree.

â€œJethro!â€ the man bellowed, taking a tighter hold on the gun he carried.

A number of men came out of the bushes. One or two had the rudiments of a uniform, but most of them were dressed in homespun, though with the addition of the bizarre â€œlibertyâ€ caps, tight-knitted woolen affairs that fitted over the head and ears, which through Johnâ€™s watering eye gave the men the bluntly menacing aspect of animated bombshells.

The wives who had presumably made these garments had knitted such mottoes as LIBERTY or FREEDOM into the bands, though one bloodthirsty abigail had knitted the adjuration KILL! into her husbandâ€™s hat. The husband in question was, Grey noted, a small and weedy specimen wearing spectacles with one shattered lens.

Fraser had stopped at the sound of the menâ€™s approach and now rounded on them like a bear brought to bay by hounds. The hounds stopped abruptly, at a safe distance.

Grey pressed a hand over his liver, which he thought had likely been ruptured, and panted. He was going to need what breath he could get.

â€œWhoâ€™re you?â€ one of the men demanded, jabbing pugnaciously at Jamie with the end of a long stick.

â€œColonel James Fraser, Morganâ€™s Rifles,â€ Fraser replied coldly, ignoring the stick. â€œAnd you?â€

The man appeared somewhat disconcerted but covered it with bluster.

â€œCorporal Jethro Woodbine, Dunningâ€™s Rangers,â€ he said, very gruff. He jerked his head at his companions, who at once spread out in a businesslike way, surrounding the clearing.

â€œWhoâ€™s your prisoner, then?â€

Grey felt his stomach tighten, which, given the condition of his liver, hurt. He replied through clenched teeth, not waiting for Jamie.

â€œI am Lord John Grey. If itâ€™s any business of yours.â€ His mind was hopping like a flea, trying to calculate whether his chances of survival were better with Jamie Fraser or with this gang of yahoos. A few moments before, he had been resigned to the idea of death at Jamieâ€™s hands, but, like many ideas, that one was more appealing in concept than in execution.

The revelation of his identity seemed to confuse the men, who squinted and murmured, glancing at him dubiously.

â€œHe ainâ€™t got a uniform on,â€ one observed to another, sotto voce. â€œBe he a soldier at all? We got no business with him if he ainâ€™t, do we?â€

â€œYes, we do,â€ Woodbine declared, regaining some of his self-confidence. â€œAnd if Colonel Fraserâ€™s taken him prisoner, I reckon he has reason?â€ His voice went up, reluctantly questioning. Jamie made no reply, his eyes fixed on Grey.

â€œHeâ€™s a soldier.â€ Heads swung round to see who had spoken. It was the small man with the shattered spectacles, who had adjusted these with one hand, the better to peer at Grey through his remaining lens. A watery blue eye inspected Grey, then the man nodded, more certain.

â€œHeâ€™s a soldier,â€ the man repeated. â€œI saw him in Philadelphia, sittinâ€™ on the porch of a house on Chestnut Street in his uniform, large as life. Heâ€™s an officer,â€ he added unnecessarily.

â€œHe is not a soldier,â€ Fraser said, and turned his head to fix the spectacled man with a firm eye.

â€œSaw him,â€ muttered the man. â€œPlain as day. Had gold braid,â€ he murmured almost inaudibly, dropping his eyes.

â€œHuh.â€ Jethro Woodbine approached Grey, examining him carefully. â€œWell, you got anything to say for yourself, Lord Grey?â€

â€œLord John,â€ Grey said crossly, and brushed a fragment of crushed leaf off his tongue. â€œI am not a peer; my elder brother is. Grey is my family name. As for being a soldier, I have been. I still bear rank within my regiment, but my commission is not active. Is that sufficient, or do you want to know what I had for breakfast this morning?â€

He was purposely antagonizing them, some part of him having decided that he would rather go with Woodbine and bear the inspection of the Continentals than remain here to face the further inspections of Jamie Fraser. Fraser was regarding him through narrowed eyes. He fought the urge to look away.

Itâ€™s the truth, he thought defiantly. What I told you is the truth. And now you know it.

Yes, said Fraserâ€™s black gaze. You think I will live quietly with it?

â€œHe is not a soldier,â€ Fraser repeated, turning his back deliberately on Grey, switching his attention to Woodbine. â€œHe is my prisoner because I wished to question him.â€

â€œAbout what?â€

â€œThat is not your concern, Mr. Woodbine,â€ Jamie said, deep voice soft but edged with steel. Jethro Woodbine, though, was nobodyâ€™s fool and meant to make that clear.

â€œIâ€™ll be judge of whatâ€™s my business. Sir,â€ he added, with a notable pause. â€œHow do we know youâ€™re who you say you are, eh? You arenâ€™t in uniform. Any of you fellows know this man?â€

The fellows, thus addressed, looked surprised. They looked uncertainly at one another; one or two heads shook in the negative.

â€œWell, then,â€ said Woodbine, emboldened. â€œIf you canâ€™t prove who you are, then I think weâ€™ll take this man back to camp for questioning.â€ He smiled unpleasantly, another thought having evidently occurred to him. â€œThink we ought to take you, too?â€

Fraser stood quite still for a moment, breathing slowly and regarding Woodbine as a tiger might regard a hedgehog: yes, he could eat it, but would the inconvenience of swallowing be worth it?



â€œTake him, then,â€ he said abruptly, stepping back from Grey. â€œI have business elsewhere.â€

Woodbine had been expecting argument; he blinked, disconcerted, and half-raised his stick, but said nothing as Fraser stalked toward the far edge of the clearing. Just under the trees, Fraser turned and gave Grey a flat, dark look.

â€œWe are not finished, sir,â€ he said.

Grey pulled himself upright, disregarding both the pain in his liver and the tears leaking from his damaged eye.

â€œAt your service, sir,â€ he snapped. Fraser glared at him and moved into the flickering green shadows, completely ignoring Woodbine and his men. One or two of them glanced at the corporal, whose face showed his indecision. Grey didnâ€™t share it. Just before Fraserâ€™s tall silhouette vanished for good, he cupped his hands to his mouth.

â€œIâ€™m not bloody sorry!â€ he bellowed.





THE PASSIONS OF YOUNG MEN

WHILE FASCINATED to hear about William and the dramatic circumstances under which he had just discovered his paternity, Jennyâ€™s true concern was for another young man.

â€œDâ€™ye ken where Young Ian is?â€ she asked eagerly. â€œAnd did he find his young woman, the Quaker lassie he told his da about?â€

I relaxed a little at this; Young Ian and Rachel Hunter wereâ€”thank Godâ€”not on the list of fraught situations. At least not for the moment.

â€œHe did,â€ I said, smiling. â€œAs for where he is . . . I havenâ€™t seen him for several days, but heâ€™s often gone for longer. He scouts for the Continental army now and then, though since theyâ€™ve been in their winter quarters at Valley Forge for so long, thereâ€™s been less need for scouting. He spends quite a bit of time there, though, because Rachel does.â€

Jenny blinked at that.

â€œShe does? Why? Do Quakers not mislike wars and such?â€

â€œWell, more or less. But her brother, Denzell, is an army surgeonâ€”though heâ€™s a real physician, not the usual horse-leech or quack-salver the army usually getsâ€”and heâ€™s been at Valley Forge since last November. Rachel comes and goes to Philadelphiaâ€”she can pass through the pickets, so she carries back food and suppliesâ€”but she works with Denny, so sheâ€™s out there, helping with patients, much more often than she is here.â€

â€œTell me about her,â€ Jenny said, leaning forward intently. â€œIs she a good lass? And dâ€™ye think she loves Young Ian? From what Ian told me, the ladâ€™s desperate in love with her but hadnâ€™t spoken to her yet, not knowing how sheâ€™d take itâ€”he wasna sure she could deal with him being . . . what he is.â€ Her quick gesture encompassed Young Ianâ€™s history and character, from Highland lad to Mohawk warrior. â€œGod kens weel heâ€™ll never make a decent Quaker, and I expect Young Ian kens that, too.â€

I laughed at the thought, though in fact the issue might be serious; I didnâ€™t know what a Quaker meeting might think of such a match, but I rather thought they might view the prospect with alarm. I knew nothing about Quaker marriage, though.

â€œSheâ€™s a very good girl,â€ I assured Jenny. â€œExtremely sensible, very capableâ€”and plainly in love with Ian, though I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s told him so, either.â€

â€œAh. Dâ€™ye ken her parents?â€

â€œNo, they both died when she was a child. She was mostly raised by a Quaker widow and then came to keep house for her brother when she was sixteen or so.â€

â€œThat the little Quaker girl?â€ Mrs. Figg had come in with a vase of summer roses, smelling of myrrh and sugar. Jenny inhaled strongly and sat up straight. â€œMercy Woodcock thinks the world of her. She comes by Mercyâ€™s house every time sheâ€™s in town, to visit that young man.â€

â€œYoung man?â€ Jenny asked, dark brows drawing together.

â€œWilliamâ€™s cousin Henry,â€ I hastened to explain. â€œDenzell and I carried out a very serious operation on him during the winter. Rachel knows both William and Henry and is very kind about visiting to see how Henry is. Mrs. Woodcock is his landlady.â€

It occurred to me that I had meant to go check on Henry today myself. There were rumors of a British withdrawal from the city, and I needed to see whether he was fit enough yet to travel. He was doing well when Iâ€™d stopped by a week before but at that point had been able to walk only a few steps, leaning on Mercy Woodcockâ€™s arm.

And what about Mercy Woodcock? I wondered, with a small jolt at the pit of the stomach. It was clear to me, as it was to John, that there was a seriousâ€”and deepeningâ€”affection between the free black woman and her aristocratic young lodger. I had met Mercyâ€™s husband, very badly wounded, during the exodus from Fort Ticonderoga a year beforeâ€”and, lacking any communication from or about him, thought it very likely that he had died after being taken prisoner by the British.

Still, the possibility of Walter Woodcock returning miraculously from the deadâ€”people did, after all, and a fresh bubble of joy rose under my heart at the thoughtâ€”was the least of the matter. I couldnâ€™t imagine that Johnâ€™s brother, the very firm-minded Duke of Pardloe, would be delighted at hearing that his youngest son meant to marry the widow of a carpenter, whatever her color.



And then there was his daughter, Dottie, speaking of Quakers: she was betrothed to Denzell Hunter, and I did wonder what the duke would think of that. John, who liked a wager, had given me no better than even odds between Dottie and her father.

I shook my head, dismissing the dozen things I could do nothing about. During this minor reverie, Jenny and Mrs. Figg appeared to have been discussing William and his abrupt departure from the scene.

â€œWhere would he go to, I wonder?â€ Mrs. Figg looked worriedly toward the wall of the stairwell, pocked with blood-smeared dents left by Williamâ€™s fist.

â€œGone to find a bottle, a fight, or a woman,â€ said Jenny, with the authority of a wife, a sister, and the mother of sons. â€œMaybe all three.â€

Elfrethâ€™s Alley

IT WAS PAST midday, and the only voices in the house were the distant chitterings of women. No one was visible in the parlor as they passed, and no one appeared as the girl led William up a foot-marked staircase to her room. It gave him an odd feeling, as though he might be invisible. He found the notion a comfort; he couldnâ€™t bear himself.

She went in before him and threw open the shutters. He wanted to tell her to close them; he felt wretchedly exposed in the flood of sunlight. But it was summer; the room was hot and airless, and he was already sweating heavily. Air swirled in, heavy with the odor of tree sap and recent rain, and the sun glowed briefly on the smooth top of her head, like the gloss on a fresh conker. She turned and smiled at him.

â€œFirst things first,â€ she announced briskly. â€œThrow off your coat and waistcoat before you suffocate.â€ Not waiting to see whether he would take this suggestion, she turned to reach for the basin and ewer. She filled the basin and stepped back, motioning him toward the washstand, where a towel and a much-used sliver of soap stood on worn wood.

â€œIâ€™ll fetch us a drink, shall I?â€ And with that, she was gone, bare feet pattering busily down the stairs.

Mechanically, he began to undress. He blinked stupidly at the basin but then recalled that, in the better sort of house, sometimes a man was required to wash his parts first. Heâ€™d encountered the custom once before, but on that occasion the whore had performed the ablution for himâ€”plying the soap to such effect that the first encounter had ended right there in the washbasin.

The memory made the blood flame up in his face again, and he ripped at his flies, popping off a button. He was still throbbing all over, but the sensation was becoming more centralized.

His hands were unsteady, and he cursed under his breath, reminded by the broken skin on his knuckles of his unceremonious exit from his fatherâ€™sâ€”no, not his bloody fatherâ€™s house. Lord Johnâ€™s.

â€œYou bloody bastard!â€ he said under his breath. â€œYou knew, you knew all along!â€ That infuriated him almost more than the horrifying revelation of his own paternity. His stepfather, whom heâ€™d loved, whom heâ€™d trusted more than anyone on earthâ€”Lord John bloody Greyâ€”had lied to him his whole life!

Everyone had lied to him.

Everyone.

He felt suddenly as though heâ€™d broken through a crust of frozen snow and plunged straight down into an unsuspected river beneath. Swept away into black breathlessness beneath the ice, helpless, voiceless, a feral chill clawing at his heart.

There was a small sound behind him and he whirled by instinct, aware only when he saw the young whoreâ€™s appalled face that he was weeping savagely, tears running down his own face, and his wet, half-hard cock flopping out of his breeches.

â€œGo away,â€ he croaked, making a frantic effort to tuck himself in.

She didnâ€™t go away but came toward him, decanter in one hand and a pair of pewter cups in the other.

â€œAre you all right?â€ she asked, eyeing him sideways. â€œHere, let me pour you a drink. You can tell me all about it.â€

â€œNo!â€

She came on toward him, but more slowly. Through his swimming eyes, he saw the twitch of her mouth as she saw his cock.

â€œI meant the water for your poor hands,â€ she said, clearly trying not to laugh. â€œI will say as youâ€™re a real gentleman, though.â€

â€œIâ€™m not!â€

She blinked.

â€œIs it an insult to call you a gentleman?â€

Overcome with fury at the word, he lashed out blindly, knocking the decanter from her hand. It burst in a spray of glass and cheap wine, and she cried out as the red soaked through her petticoat.

â€œYou bastard!â€ she shrieked, and, drawing back her arm, threw the cups at his head. She didnâ€™t hit him, and they clanged and rolled away across the floor. She was turning toward the door, crying out, â€œNed! Ned!â€ when he lunged and caught her.

He only wanted to stop her shrieking, stop her bringing up whatever male enforcement the house employed. He got a hand on her mouth, yanking her back from the door, grappling one-handed to try to control her flailing arms.

â€œIâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m sorry!â€ he kept saying. â€œI didnâ€™t meanâ€”I donâ€™t meanâ€”oh, bloody hell!â€ She caught him abruptly in the nose with her elbow and he let go, backing away with a hand to his face, blood dripping through his fingers.

Her face was marked with red where heâ€™d held her, and her eyes were wild. She backed away, scrubbing at her mouth with the back of her hand.

â€œGet . . . out!â€ she gasped.

He didnâ€™t need telling twice. He rushed past her, shouldered his way past a burly man charging up the stairs, and ran down the alley, realizing only when he reached the street that he was in his shirtsleeves, having left coat and waistcoat behind, and his breeches were undone.

â€œEllesmere!â€ said an appalled voice nearby. He looked up in horror to find himself the cynosure of several English officers, including Alexander Lindsay.

â€œGood Christ, Ellesmere, what happened?â€ Sandy was by way of being a friend and was already pulling a voluminous snowy handkerchief from his sleeve. He clapped this to Williamâ€™s nose, pinching his nostrils and insisting that he put his head back.

â€œHave you been set upon and robbed?â€ one of the others demanded. â€œGod! This filthy place!â€

He felt at once comforted by their companyâ€”and hideously embarrassed by it. He was not one of them, not any longer.

â€œWas it? Was it robbery?â€ another said, glaring round eagerly. â€œWeâ€™ll find the bastards who did it, â€™pon my honor we will! Weâ€™ll get your property back and teach whoever did it a lesson!â€

Blood was running down the back of his throat, harsh and iron-tasting, and he coughed but did his best to nod and shrug simultaneously. He had been robbed. But no one was ever going to give him back what heâ€™d lost today.





UNDER MY PROTECTION

THE BELL OF THE Presbyterian church two blocks away rang for half-two, and my stomach echoed it, reminding me thatâ€”what with one thing and anotherâ€”I hadnâ€™t had any tea yet.

Jenny had had a bite with Marsali and the children but declared herself equal to dealing with an egg, if there might be one, so I sent Mrs. Figg to see whether there might, and within twenty minutes we were wallowingâ€”in a genteel fashionâ€”in soft-boiled eggs, fried sardines, andâ€”for lack of cakeâ€”flapjacks with butter and honey, which Jenny had never seen before but took to with the greatest alacrity.

â€œLook how it soaks up the sweetness!â€ she exclaimed, pressing the spongy little cake with a fork, then releasing it. â€œNay like a bannock at all!â€ She glanced over her shoulder, then leaned toward me, lowering her voice. â€œDâ€™ye think her in the kitchen might show me the way of it, if I asked?â€

A diffident rapping on the damaged front door interrupted her, and as I turned to look, it was shoved open and a long shadow fell across the painted canvas rug, narrowly preceding its owner. A young British subaltern peered into the parlor, looking disconcerted by the wreckage in the foyer.

â€œLieutentant Colonel Grey?â€ he asked hopefully, glancing back and forth between Jenny and me.

â€œHis lordship isnâ€™t in just now,â€ I said, attempting to sound self-possessed. I wondered just how many more times I might have to say thatâ€”and to whom.

â€œOh.â€ The young man looked further disconcerted. â€œCan you tell me where he is, mum? Colonel Graves sent a message earlier, asking Lieutenant Colonel Grey to attend General Clinton at once, and the general was, er . . . rather wondering why the lieutenant colonel hadnâ€™t arrived yet.â€

â€œAh,â€ I said, with a sidewise glance at Jenny. â€œWell. Iâ€™m afraid his lordship was rather urgently called away before he received the colonelâ€™s message.â€ That must have been the paper John had received moments before Jamieâ€™s dramatic reappearance from a watery grave. Heâ€™d glanced at it but then shoved it unread into his breechesâ€™ pocket.

The soldier heaved a small sigh at this but was undaunted.

â€œYes, mum. If youâ€™ll tell me where his lordship is, Iâ€™ll go fetch him there. I really canâ€™t go back without him, you know.â€ He gave me a woeful look, though with a touch of a charming smile. I smiled back, with a small touch of panic in my midsection.

â€œIâ€™m so sorry, but I really donâ€™t know where he is right now,â€ I said, standing up in hopes of driving him back toward the door.

â€œWell, mum, if youâ€™ll just tell me where he was heading, I shall go there and seek direction,â€ he said, doggedly standing his ground.

â€œHe didnâ€™t tell me.â€ I took a step toward him, but he didnâ€™t retreat. This was escalating beyond absurdity into something more serious. Iâ€™d met General Clinton briefly at the Mischianza ball a few weeks agoâ€”God, had it been only weeks? It seemed whole lifetimesâ€”and while heâ€™d been quite cordial to me, I didnâ€™t think heâ€™d receive a nolle prosequi from me with any sort of complaisance. Generals tended to think highly of their own consequence.

â€œYou know, his lordship doesnâ€™t hold an active commission,â€ I said, in the faint hope of putting the young man off. He looked surprised.

â€œYes, he does, mum. The colonel sent notice of it with the message this morning.â€

â€œWhat? He canâ€™t do thatâ€”er, can he?â€ I asked, a sudden dread creeping up my backbone.

â€œDo what, mum?â€

â€œJustâ€”just tell his lordship that his commission is active?â€

â€œOh, no, mum,â€ he assured me. â€œThe colonel of Lieutenant Colonel Greyâ€™s regiment re-called him. The Duke of Pardloe.â€

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,â€ I said, sitting down. Jenny snatched up her napkin to muffle what was plainly a laugh; it had been twenty-five years since sheâ€™d heard me say that. I gave her a look, but this was no time to be picking up the threads.

â€œAll right,â€ I said, turning to face the young man again and taking a deep breath. â€œIâ€™d better go with you to see the general.â€ I got to my feet again and only at this point realized that, having been surprised whilst changing, I was still wearing nothing but my shift and dressing gown.

â€œIâ€™ll help ye dress,â€ Jenny said, standing up hurriedly. She gave the soldier a charming smile and gestured at the table, now strewn with toast, marmalade, and a steaming dish of kippers. â€œHave a bite while ye wait, lad. No point wasting good food.â€





JENNY POKED HER head out into the corridor and listened, but the faint sound of a fork on china and Mrs. Figgâ€™s voice from below indicated that the soldier had accepted her suggestion. She quietly closed the door.

â€œIâ€™ll go with ye,â€ she said. â€œThe townâ€™s full of soldiers; ye shouldna go out by yourself.â€

â€œIâ€™ll beâ€”â€ I began, but then stopped, unsure. Most of the British officers in Philadelphia knew me as Lady John Grey, but that didnâ€™t mean that rank-and-file soldiers shared either that knowledge or the sense of respect that it normally engendered. I also felt like an imposter, but that was rather beside the point; it didnâ€™t show.

â€œThank you,â€ I said abruptly. â€œIâ€™d be glad of your company.â€ Unsure as I felt about everything save my conviction that Jamie was coming, I was glad of a little moral supportâ€”though I wondered whether I might need to warn Jenny of the need for circumspection when I talked to General Clinton.

â€œI shallna say a word myself,â€ she assured me, grunting slightly as she pulled my laces tight. â€œDâ€™ye think ye should tell him whatâ€™s happened to Lord John?â€

â€œNo, I definitely donâ€™t,â€ I said, exhaling forcefully. â€œThatâ€™s . . . tight enough.â€

â€œMmm.â€ She was already deep in the armoire, picking through my gowns. â€œWhat about this one? Itâ€™s got a deep dÃ©colletage, and your bosomâ€™s still verra good.â€

â€œIâ€™m not meaning to seduce the man!â€

â€œOh, yes, ye are,â€ she said matter-of-factly. â€œOr at least distract him. If yeâ€™re no going to tell him the truth, I mean.â€ One sleek black eyebrow lifted. â€œIf I were a British general and was told that my wee colonel had been abducted by a wicked great Hieland man, I think I might take it amiss.â€

I couldnâ€™t really contradict this piece of reasoning and, with a brief shrug, wriggled my way into the amber silk, which had cream-colored piping in the seams and ruched cream ribbons outlining the edge of the bodice.

â€œOh, aye, thatâ€™s good,â€ Jenny said, tying my laces and stepping back to eye the effect with approval. â€œThe ribbonâ€™s near the same color as your skin, so the neck looks even lower than it is.â€

â€œOne would think youâ€™d spent the last thirty years running a dressmakerâ€™s salon or a brothel, rather than a farm,â€ I remarked, nervousness making me rather cross. She snorted.

â€œIâ€™ve got three daughters, nine granddaughters, and thereâ€™s sixteen nieces and great-nieces on Ianâ€™s sisterâ€™s side. Itâ€™s often much the same sort oâ€™ thing.â€

That made me laugh, and she grinned at me. Then I was blinking back tears, and so was sheâ€”the thought of Brianna and of Ian, our lost ones, coming suddenlyâ€”and then we were embracing, holding hard to each other to keep grief at bay.

â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ she whispered, hugging me fiercely. â€œYeâ€™ve not lost your lass. Sheâ€™s still alive. And Ianâ€™s still wiâ€™ me. Heâ€™ll never go from my side.â€

â€œI know,â€ I said, choked. â€œI know.â€ I let go and straightened up, smudging tears away with a finger, sniffing. â€œHave you got a handkerchief?â€



She had one in her hand, in fact, but reached into the pocket at her waist and pulled out another, freshly washed and folded, which she handed me.

â€œIâ€™m a grannie,â€ she said, and blew her nose vigorously. â€œIâ€™ve always got a spare hankie. Or three. Now, what about your hair? Ye canna be going out in the street like that.â€

By the time weâ€™d got my hair done up in something resembling order, corralled in a snood and pinned respectably under a broad-brimmed woven straw hat, Iâ€™d come up with at least a rough notion of what to tell General Clinton. Stick to the truth as far as possible. That was the first principle of successful lying, though it had been some time since Iâ€™d been last obliged to employ it.

Well, then. A messenger had come for Lord Johnâ€”one hadâ€”bringing a noteâ€”he did. I had no idea what was in the noteâ€”totally true. Lord John had then left with the messenger but without telling me where they were going. Also technically true, the only variance being that it had been a different messenger. No, I hadnâ€™t seen in which direction they had gone; no, I didnâ€™t know whether they had walked or riddenâ€”Lord Johnâ€™s saddle horse was kept at Davisonâ€™s livery on Fifth Street, two blocks away.

That sounded good. If General Clinton chose to make inquiries, I was reasonably sure heâ€™d discover the horse still in its stall and thus conclude that John was somewhere in the city. He would also presumably lose interest in me as a source of information and send soldiers round to whatever haunts a man such as Lord John Grey might be supposed to be visiting.

And with any luck at all, by the time the general had exhausted such possibilities as Philadelphia offered, John would be back and could answer his own damned questions.

â€œAnd what about Jamie?â€ Jenny asked, her face showing small signs of anxiety. â€œHeâ€™ll not come back into the city, surely?â€

â€œI hope not.â€ I could scarcely draw breath, and not merely because of the tight lacing. I could feel the thudding of my heart against the placket of the stays.

Jenny gave me a long, considering look, eyes narrowed, and shook her head.

â€œNo, ye donâ€™t,â€ she said. â€œYe think heâ€™ll come straight back here. For you. And yeâ€™re right. He will.â€ She considered for a moment longer, her brow furrowed. â€œIâ€™d best stay here,â€ she said abruptly. â€œShould he come back whilst yeâ€™re wiâ€™ the general, heâ€™ll need to know whatâ€™s the state oâ€™ things. And I dinna think I trust her in the kitchen not to stab him wiâ€™ a toasting fork, should he loom up in her doorway without notice.â€

I laughed, all too easily envisioning Mrs. Figgâ€™s response to a sudden Highlander in her midst.

â€œBesides,â€ she added, â€œsomeoneâ€™s got to clear up the mess, and Iâ€™ve had a good bit oâ€™ practice wiâ€™ that, too.â€



THE YOUNG SOLDIER greeted my belated reappearance with relief and, while not actually seizing my arm and hustling me down the pavement, offered me his own arm and then walked in such a fashion that I was urged into a near trot to keep up with him. It was not far to the mansion where Clinton had made his headquarters, but the day was warm and I arrived moist and gasping, with tendrils of hair escaping from under my straw hat and sticking to my neck and cheeks, and tendrils of sweat snaking their tickling slow way down inside my bodice.

My escort delivered meâ€”with an audible sigh of reliefâ€”to another soldier in the spacious parquet-floored foyer, and I had a moment to shake the dust from my skirts, straighten and re-pin my hat, and blot my face and neck discreetly with a ladylike lace hankie. I was sufficiently taken up with this that it was a moment before I recognized the man sitting on one of the little gilded chairs on the other side of the foyer.

â€œLady John,â€ he said, standing up when he saw that I had noticed him. â€œYour servant, maâ€™am.â€ He smiled slightly, though it lent no warmth at all to his eyes.

â€œCaptain Richardson,â€ I said flatly. â€œHow nice.â€ I didnâ€™t offer my hand and he didnâ€™t bow. There was no point in trying to pretend that we were anything but enemiesâ€”and not very cordial ones, either. Heâ€™d precipitated my marriage to Lord John by inquiring of John whether he, John, had any personal interest in me, as he, Richardson, was contemplating my immediate arrest on grounds of spying and of passing seditious materials. Both charges were quite true, and while John might not have known that, he took Richardsonâ€™s word regarding his intentions, told Richardson politely that, no, there was no personal interestâ€”also true as a statement, so far as it wentâ€”and two hours later I was standing in his parlor in a daze of shock and grief, mechanically saying, â€œI do,â€ in response to questions that I neither heard nor comprehended.

I had barely heard Richardsonâ€™s name at the time, let alone known him by sight. John had introduced meâ€”with cold formalityâ€”when Richardson came up to us at the Mischianza, the huge ball thrown for the British officers by the Loyalist ladies of Philadelphia a month before. And only then had he told me about Richardsonâ€™s threats, with a brief admonition to avoid the fellow.

â€œAre you waiting to see General Clinton?â€ I inquired politely. If he was, I had half a mind to execute a quiet sneak through the house and out of the back door whilst he was ensconced with the general.

â€œI am,â€ he replied, adding graciously, â€œbut you must certainly go before me, Lady John. My business will wait.â€

That had a mildly sinister ring to it, but I merely inclined my head politely, with a noncommittal â€œHmm.â€

It was dawning upon me, like an incipient case of indigestion, that my position with regard to the British army in general, and Captain Richardson in particular, was on the verge of a marked reevaluation. Once it became common knowledge that Jamie wasnâ€™t deadâ€”then I was no longer Lady John Grey. I was Mrs. James Fraser again, and while that was certainly cause for ecstatic rejoicing, it also removed any restraint on Captain Richardsonâ€™s baser urges.

Before I could think of anything useful to say to the man, a lanky young lieutenant appeared to usher me into the generalâ€™s presence. The drawing room, which had been converted to Clintonâ€™s main office, was now in a state of organized disarray, with packing crates lining one wall and bare flagstaffs tied together like a bundle of faggots, the military banners they usually sported being folded briskly into tidy packets by a corporal near the window. Iâ€™d heardâ€”the whole city had probably heardâ€”that the British army was withdrawing from Philadelphia. Evidently they were doing so with considerable dispatch.

There were several other soldiers carrying things in and out, but two men were seated, one on either side of the desk.

â€œLady John,â€ Clinton said, looking surprised but rising from his desk and coming to bow over my hand. â€œYour most obedient servant, maâ€™am.â€

â€œGood day to you, sir,â€ I said. My heart had already been beating fast; it speeded up considerably at sight of the man who had risen from his chair and was standing just behind the general. He was in uniform and looked strikingly familiar, but I was sure Iâ€™d never seen him before. Whoâ€”?

â€œI am so sorry to have disturbed you, Lady John. I had hoped to surprise your husband,â€ the general was saying. â€œBut I understand that he is not at home?â€

â€œEr . . . no. Heâ€™s not.â€ The strangerâ€”an infantry colonel, though his uniform seemed to sport even more gold lace than the usualâ€”raised a brow at this. The sudden familiarity of the gesture gave me a slight spinning sensation in the head.

â€œYouâ€™re a relative of Lord John Greyâ€™s,â€ I blurted, staring at him. He had to be. The man wore his own hair, as John did, though his was dark beneath its powder. The shape of his headâ€”fine-boned and long-skulledâ€”was Johnâ€™s, and so was the set of his shoulders. His features were much like Johnâ€™s, too, but his face was deeply weathered and gaunt, marked with harsh lines carved by long duty and the stress of command. I didnâ€™t need the uniform to tell me that he was a lifelong soldier.

He smiled, and his face was suddenly transformed. Apparently he had Johnâ€™s charm, too.

â€œYouâ€™re most perceptive, madam,â€ he said, and, stepping forward, smoothly took my limp hand away from the general and kissed it briefly in the continental manner before straightening and eyeing me with interest.

â€œGeneral Clinton informs me that you are my brotherâ€™s wife.â€

â€œOh,â€ I said, scrambling to recover my mental bearings. â€œThen you must be Hal! Er . . . I beg your pardon. I mean, youâ€™re the . . . Iâ€™m sorry, I know youâ€™re a duke, but Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t recall your title, Your Grace.â€

â€œPardloe,â€ he said, still holding my hand and smiling at me. â€œBut my Christian name is Harold; do please use it if you like. Welcome to the family, my dear. I had no idea John had married. I understand the event was quite recent?â€ He spoke with great cordiality, but I was aware of the intense curiosity behind his good manners.

â€œAh,â€ I said noncommittally. â€œYes, quite recent.â€ It hadnâ€™t for an instant occurred to me to wonder whether John had written to tell his family about me, and if he had, they could barely have received the letter by now. I didnâ€™t even know who all the members of his family wereâ€”though I had heard about Hal, he being the father of Johnâ€™s nephew Henry, whoâ€”



â€œOh, of course, youâ€™ve come to see Henry!â€ I exclaimed. â€œHeâ€™ll be so pleased to see you! Heâ€™s doing very well,â€ I assured him.

â€œI have already seen Henry,â€ the duke assured me in turn. â€œHe speaks with the greatest admiration of your skill in removing pieces of his intestine and reuniting the remnants. Though eager as I naturally was to see my sonâ€”and my daughterâ€â€”his lips compressed for a moment; apparently Dottie had informed her parents about her engagementâ€”â€œand delighted as I shall be to meet my brother again, it is actually duty that called me to America. My regiment is newly landed in New York.â€

â€œOh,â€ I said. â€œEr . . . how nice.â€ John plainly hadnâ€™t known that his brother, let alone his regiment, was coming. It occurred dimly to me that I ought to be asking questions and finding out what I could about the generalâ€™s plans, but it didnâ€™t seem the time or place.

The general coughed politely.

â€œLady Johnâ€”do you happen to know the whereabouts of your husband at the moment?â€

The shock of meeting Harold, Duke of Pardloe, had quite wiped the reason for my presence out of my mind, but this brought it back with a rush.

â€œNo, Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t,â€ I said, as calmly as possible. â€œI told your corporal. A messenger came a few hours ago, with a note, and Lord John went off with him. He didnâ€™t say where he was going, though.â€

The generalâ€™s lips twitched.

â€œActually,â€ he said, still polite, â€œhe didnâ€™t. Colonel Graves sent the messenger, with a note informing Lord John of his re-commission and directing him to come here at once. He didnâ€™t.â€

â€œOh,â€ I said, sounding as blank as I felt. Under the circumstances, it seemed all right to let that show, and I did. â€œDear me. In that case . . . he did go off with someone.â€

â€œBut you donâ€™t know with whom?â€

â€œI didnâ€™t see him go,â€ I said, neatly avoiding the question. â€œIâ€™m afraid he didnâ€™t leave word as to where he was bound.â€

Clinton raised a strongly marked black brow and glanced at Pardloe.

â€œI suppose in that case he will return shortly,â€ the duke said with a shrug. â€œThe matter isnâ€™t urgent, after all.â€

General Clinton looked as though he differed somewhat with this opinion but, with a brief glance at me, said nothing. He clearly had little time to waste, though, and, bowing politely, bade me good day.

I took my leave with alacrity, barely pausing to assure the duke that I was pleased to have met him and to ask where might his brother send word . . . ?

â€œI have rooms at the Kingâ€™s Arms,â€ Pardloe said. â€œShall Iâ€”â€

â€œNo, no,â€ I said hurriedly, to forestall his offer to see me home. â€œItâ€™s quite all right. Thank you, sir.â€ I bowed to the general, then to Hal, and headed for the door in a whirl of skirtsâ€”and emotions.

Captain Richardson was no longer in the foyer, but I hadnâ€™t time to wonder where he had gone. I gave the soldier at the door a quick nod and smile and then was out in the open air, breathing as though Iâ€™d just escaped from a bathysphere.

Now what? I wondered, swerving to avoid two little boys with a hoop, who were caroming down the street, bouncing off the legs of the soldiers carrying parcels and furniture to a large wagon. The boys must belong to one of Clintonâ€™s officers, since the soldiers were tolerating them.

John had spoken fairly often of his brother and had remarked upon Halâ€™s tendency toward ruthless high-handedness. All the current situation needed was a nosey parker with a taste for authority mixing in. I wondered briefly whether William was on good terms with his uncle; if so, perhaps Hal could be diverted and put to good use in talking sense toâ€”no, no, of course not. Hal mustnâ€™t knowâ€”yet at leastâ€”about Jamie, and he couldnâ€™t exchange two words with Willie without finding outâ€”if William would talk about it, but thenâ€”

â€œLady John.â€ A voice behind me stopped me in my tracks, only momentarily but long enough for the Duke of Pardloe to come up beside me. He took me by the arm, detaining me.

â€œYouâ€™re a very bad liar,â€ he remarked with interest. â€œWhat are you lying about, though, I wonder?â€

â€œI do it better with a little warning,â€ I snapped. â€œThough, as it happens, Iâ€™m not lying at the moment.â€

That made him laugh. He leaned closer, examining my face at close range. His eyes were pale blue, like Johnâ€™s, but the darkness of his brows and lashes gave them a particularly piercing quality.

â€œPerhaps not,â€ he said, still looking amused. â€œBut if you arenâ€™t lying, you arenâ€™t telling me everything you know, either.â€

â€œIâ€™m not obliged to tell you anything I know,â€ I said with dignity, trying to retrieve my arm. â€œLet go.â€

He did let go, reluctantly.

â€œI beg your pardon, Lady John.â€

â€œCertainly,â€ I said shortly, and made to go round him. He moved smartly in front of me, blocking my way.

â€œI want to know where my brother is,â€ he said.

â€œI should like to know that myself,â€ I replied, trying to sidle past him.

â€œWhere are you going, may I ask?â€

â€œHome.â€ It gave me an odd feeling, still, to call Lord Johnâ€™s house â€œhomeâ€â€”and yet I had no other. Yes, you do, a small, clear voice said in my heart. You have Jamie.

â€œWhy are you smiling?â€ asked Pardloe, sounding startled.

â€œAt the thought of getting home and taking off these shoes,â€ I said, hastily erasing the smile. â€œTheyâ€™re killing me.â€

His mouth twitched a little.

â€œAllow me to offer you the use of my chair, Lady John.â€

â€œOh, no, I really donâ€™tâ€”â€ But he had taken a wooden whistle from his pocket and uttered a piercing blast on it that brought two squat, muscular menâ€”who had to be brothers, such was their resemblance to each otherâ€”trotting round the corner, a sedan chair suspended on poles between them.

â€œNo, no, this isnâ€™t necessary at all,â€ I protested. â€œBesides, John says you suffer from the gout; youâ€™ll need the chair yourself.â€

He didnâ€™t like that; his eyes narrowed and his lips compressed.

â€œIâ€™ll manage, madam,â€ he said shortly, and, seizing me by the arm again, dragged me to the chair and pushed me inside, knocking my hat over my eyes as he did so. â€œThe lady is under my protection. Take her to the Kingâ€™s Arms,â€ he instructed Tweedledum and Tweedledee, shutting the door. And before I could say, â€œOff with his head!â€ we were jolting down the High Street at a terrific pace.

I seized the door handle, intending to leap out, even at the cost of cuts and bruises, but the bastard had put the locking pin through the outside handle, and I couldnâ€™t reach it from the inside. I shouted at the chairmen to stop, but they ignored me completely, pounding along the cobbles as though bringing the news from Aix to Ghent.

I sat back, panting and furious, and jerked the hat off. What did Pardloe think he was doing? From what John had said, and from other remarks made by the dukeâ€™s children about their father, it was clear to me that he was used to getting his own way.

â€œWell, weâ€™ll bloody see about that,â€ I muttered, stabbing the long, pearl-headed hatpin through the hat brim. The snood that had contained my hair had come off with the hat; I crammed it inside and shook my loose hair out over my shoulders.

We turned in to Fourth Street, which was paved with brick rather than cobbles, and the jolting grew less. I was able to let go my grip on the seat and fumbled with the window. If I could get it open, I might be able to reach the locking pin, and even if the door flew open and decanted me into the street, it would put a stop to the dukeâ€™s machinations.

The window worked on a sliding-panel arrangement but had no sort of latch by which to get a grip on it; the only way of opening it was by inserting the fingertips into a shallow groove at one side and pushing. I was grimly attempting to do this, in spite of the chairâ€™s renewed bucketing, when I heard the dukeâ€™s voice choke and stop in the midst of some shouted direction to the chairmen.

â€œSt . . . stop. I . . . canâ€™t . . .â€ His words trailed off, the chairmen faltered to a halt, and I pressed my face against the suddenly motionless window. The duke was standing in the middle of the street, a fist pressed into his waistcoat, struggling to breathe. His face was deeply flushed, but his lips were tinged with blue.

â€œPut me down and open this bloody door this instant!â€ I bellowed through the glass to one of the chairmen, who was glancing back over his shoulder, a look of concern on his face. They did, and I emerged from the chair in an explosion of skirts, stabbing the hatpin down into the placket of my stays as I did so. I might need it yet.

â€œBloody sit down,â€ I said, reaching Pardloe. He shook his head but let me lead him to the chair, where I forced him to sit, my feeling of satisfaction at this reversal of position somewhat tempered by the fear that he might just possibly be about to die.

My first thoughtâ€”that he was having a heart attackâ€”had vanished the moment I heard him breatheâ€”or try to. The wheezing gasp of someone in the throes of an asthmatic attack was unmistakable, but I seized his wrist and checked his pulse just in case. Hammering but steady, and while he was sweating, it was the normal warm perspiration caused by hot weather rather than the sudden clammy exudation that often accompanied a myocardial infarction.

I touched his fist, still embedded in his midsection.

â€œDo you have pain here?â€

He shook his head, coughed hard, and took his hand away.

â€œNeed . . . pill . . . b . . .â€ he managed, and I saw that there was a small pocket in the waistcoat that he had been trying to reach into. I put in two fingers and pulled out a small enameled box, which proved to contain a tiny corked vial.

â€œWhatâ€”never mind.â€ I pulled the cork, sniffed, and wheezed myself as the sudden fumes of ammonia shot up my nose.

â€œNo,â€ I said definitely, putting the cork back in and shoving vial and box into my pocket. â€œThat wonâ€™t help. Purse your lips and blow out.â€ His eyes bulged a bit, but he did it; I could feel the slight movement of air on my own perspiring face.

â€œRight. Now, relax, donâ€™t gasp for air, just let it come. Blow out, to the count of four. One . . . two . . . three . . . four. In for a count of two, same rhythm . . . yes. Blow out, count of four . . . let it come in, count of two . . . yes, good. Now, donâ€™t worry; you arenâ€™t going to suffocate, you can keep doing that all day.â€ I smiled encouragingly at him, and he managed to nod. I straightened up and looked round; we were near Locust Street, and Petermanâ€™s ordinary was no more than a block away.

â€œYou,â€ I said to one of the chairmen, â€œrun to the ordinary and fetch back a jug of strong coffee. Heâ€™ll pay for it,â€ I added, with a flip of the hand toward the duke.

We were beginning to draw a crowd. I kept a wary eye out; we were near enough to Dr. Hebdyâ€™s surgery that he might come out to see the trouble, and the very last thing I needed was that charlatan to materialize, fleam at the ready.

â€œYou have asthma,â€ I said, returning my attention to the duke. I knelt so that I could see into his face while I monitored his pulse. It was better, noticeably slower, but I thought I could feel the odd condition called â€œparadoxical pulse,â€ a phenomenon you sometimes saw in asthmatics, wherein the heart rate speeded up during exhalation and dropped during inhalation. Not that I had been in any doubt. â€œDid you know that?â€

He nodded, still pursing his lips and blowing.

â€œYes,â€ he managed briefly, before breathing in again.

â€œDo you see a doctor for it?â€ A nod. â€œAnd did he actually recommend sal volatile for it?â€ I gestured toward the vial in my pocket. He shook his head.

â€œFor fain . . . ting,â€ he managed. â€œAll I . . . had.â€

â€œRight.â€ I put a hand under his chin and tilted his head back, examining his pupils, which were quite normal. I could feel the spasm easing, and so could he; his shoulders were beginning to drop, and the blue tinge had faded from his lips. â€œYou donâ€™t want to use it when youâ€™re having an asthma attack; the coughing and tearing will make matters worse by producing phlegm.â€

â€œWhatever are the idle lot of you doing, standing about? Go run and fetch the doctor, lad!â€ I heard a womanâ€™s sharp voice say in the crowd behind me. I grimaced, and the duke saw it; he raised his brows in question.



â€œYou donâ€™t want that doctor, believe me.â€ I stood up and faced the crowd, thinking.

â€œNo, we donâ€™t need a doctor, thank you very much,â€ I said, as charmingly as possible. â€œHeâ€™s just been overtaken by the indigestionâ€”something he ate. Heâ€™s quite all right now.â€

â€œHe donâ€™t look that good to me, maâ€™am,â€ said another voice, doubtful. â€œI think we best fetch the doctor.â€

â€œLet him die!â€ came a shout from the back of the gathering crowd. â€œFucking lobster!â€

An odd sort of shimmer ran through the crowd at this, and I felt a knot of dread form in my stomach. They hadnâ€™t been thinking of him as a British soldier, merely as a spectacle. But now . . .

â€œIâ€™ll get the doctor, Lady John!â€ To my horror, Mr. Caulfield, a prominent Tory, had forced his way to the front, being tolerably free with his gold-headed walking stick. â€œGet away, you lice!â€

He bent to peer into the sedan chair, lifting his hat to Hal.

â€œYour servant, sir. Help will be here presently, be assured of that!â€

I seized him by the sleeve. The crowd was, thank God, divided. While there were catcalls and insults directed at Pardloe and at me, there were dissenting voices, too, those of Loyalists (or perhaps merely the saner sorts who didnâ€™t think attacking a sick man in the street part of their political philosophy) chiming in, with reason, protestsâ€”and not a few loud insults of their own.

â€œNo, no!â€ I said. â€œLet someone else go for the doctor, please. We darenâ€™t leave His Grace here without protection!â€

â€œHis Grace?â€ Caulfield blinked, and carefully unfolding his gold-rimmed pince-nez from a little case, put them on his nose and bent to peer into the chair at Pardloe, who gave him a small, dignified nod, though he kept on assiduously with his breathing exercise.

â€œThe Duke of Pardloe,â€ I said hastily, still keeping a grip of Mr. Caulfieldâ€™s sleeve. â€œYour Grace, may I present Mr. Phineas Graham Caulfield?â€ I waved a vague hand between them, then, spotting the chairman coming back at the gallop with a jug, I sprinted toward him, hoping to reach him before he got within earshot of the crowd.

â€œThank you,â€ I said, panting as I snatched the jug from him. â€œWeâ€™ve got to get him away before the crowd turns nastyâ€”nastier,â€ I amended, hearing a sharp crack! as a thrown pebble bounced off the roof of the sedan chair. Mr. Caulfield ducked.

â€œOy!â€ shouted the chairman, infuriated at this attack upon his livelihood. â€œBack off, you lot!â€ He started for the crowd, fists clenched, and I seized him by the coattails with my free hand.

â€œGet himâ€”and your chairâ€”away!â€ I said, as forcefully as possible. â€œTake him toâ€”toâ€”â€ Not the Kingâ€™s Arms; it was a known Loyalist stronghold and would merely inflame anyone who followed us. Neither did I want to be at the dukeâ€™s mercy, once inside the place.

â€œTake us to Number Seventeen Chestnut Street!â€ I said hurriedly, and, digging one-handed in my pocket, grabbed a coin and thrust it into his hand. â€œNow!â€ He didnâ€™t pause for thought but took the coin and headed for the chair at the run, fists still clenched, and I trotted after him as fast as my red morocco heels would take me, clutching the coffee. His number was stitched into a band round his sleeve: THIRTY-NINE.

A shower of pebbles was rattling off the sedan chairâ€™s sides, and the second chairmanâ€”Number Fortyâ€”was batting at them as though they were a swarm of bees, shouting, â€œFuck OFF!â€ at the crowd, in a businesslike if repetitious fashion. Mr. Caulfield was backing him up in more genteel fashion, shouting, â€œAway with you!â€ and â€œLeave off at once!â€ punctuated with pokes of his cane at the more daring children, who were darting forward to see the fun.

â€œHere,â€ I gasped, leaning into the chair. Hal was still alive, still breathing. He raised one brow at me and nodded toward the crowd outside. I shook my head and thrust the coffee into his hands.

â€œDrink . . . that,â€ I managed, â€œand keep breathing.â€ Slamming the door of the chair, I dropped the locking pin into its slot with an instantâ€™s satisfaction and straightened up to find Fergusâ€™s eldest son, Germain, standing by my side.

â€œHave ye got a bit of trouble started again, Grand-mÃ¨re?â€ he asked, unperturbed by the stonesâ€”now augmented with clumps of fresh manureâ€”whizzing past our heads.

â€œYou might say so, yes,â€ I said. â€œDonâ€™tâ€”â€

But before I could speak further, he turned round and bellowed at the crowd, in a surprisingly loud voice, â€œTHISâ€™S MY GRANNIE. You touch ONE HAIR on her head andâ€”â€ Several people in the crowd laughed at this, and I put up a hand to my head. Iâ€™d completely forgotten the loss of my hat, and my hair was standing out in a mushroom-like cloud round my headâ€”what wasnâ€™t sticking to my sweating face and neck. â€œAnd Iâ€™ll do you BROWN!â€ Germain yelled. â€œAye, I mean YOU, Shecky Loew! And you, too, Joe Grume!â€

Two half-grown boys hesitated, clumps of filth in hand. Evidently they knew Germain.

â€œAnd my grannieâ€™ll tell your da what youâ€™ve been a-doing, too!â€ That decided the boys, who stepped back a pace, dropping their clods of dirt and trying to look as though they had no idea where they had come from.

â€œCome on, Grand-mÃ¨re,â€ Germain said, grabbing my hand. The chairmen, no slouches on the uptake, had already seized their poles and hoisted the chair. Iâ€™d never manage to keep up with them in the high-heeled shoes. As I was kicking them off, I saw plump Dr. Hebdy puffing down the street, in the wake of the hectoring woman who had suggested calling him and who was now sailing toward us on the breeze of her heroism, face set in triumph.

â€œThank you, Mr. Caulfield,â€ I said hurriedly, and, snatching up the shoes in one hand, followed the chair, unable to keep my skirts up off the grubby cobbles but not terribly concerned about that. Germain fell back a little, making threatening gestures to discourage pursuit, but I could tell from the sound of the crowd that their momentary hostility had turned to amusement, and though further catcalls followed us, no missiles came in their wake.

The chairmen slowed a little once weâ€™d turned the corner, and I was able to make headway on the flat brick of Chestnut Street, coming up beside the chair. Hal was peering through the side window, looking considerably better. The coffee jug was on the seat beside him, evidently empty.

â€œWhere are we . . . going, madam?â€ he shouted through the window when he saw me. So far as I could tell over the steady thump of the chairmenâ€™s shoes and through the glass of the window, he sounded much better, too.

â€œDonâ€™t worry, Your Grace,â€ I shouted back, jogging along. â€œYouâ€™re under my protection!â€





THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF ILL-CONSIDERED ACTIONS

JAMIE SHOVED THROUGH the brush, heedless of ripping brambles and slapping branches. Anything that got in his way could get out of it or be trampled.

He hesitated for no more than an instant when he reached the two horses, hobbled and grazing. He untied them both and, slapping the mare, sent her snorting into the brush. Even if no one made off with the extra horse before the militia let John Grey go, Jamie didnâ€™t mean to make it easy for the man to get back to Philadelphia. Whatever must be dealt with there would be done much more easily without the complications of his lordshipâ€™s presence.

And what would be done? he wondered, nudging his heels into his horseâ€™s sides and reining its head round toward the road. He noticed with some surprise that his hands were shaking, and squeezed hard on the leather to make it stop.

The knuckles of his right hand throbbed, and a white stab of pain where his missing finger had been ran through his hand, making him hiss through his teeth.

â€œWhat the devil did ye tell me for, ye wee idiot?â€ he said under his breath, urging his horse up into a gallop. â€œWhat did ye think Iâ€™d do?â€

Just what ye damn well did was the answer. John hadnâ€™t resisted, hadnâ€™t fought back. â€œGo ahead and kill me,â€ the wee bugger had said. A fresh spurt of rage curled Jamieâ€™s hands as he imagined all too well doing just that. Would he have gone ahead and done it, if that pissant Woodbine and his militia hadnâ€™t turned up?

No. No, he wouldnâ€™t. Even as he longed momentarily to go back and choke the life out of Grey, he was beginning to answer his own question, reason fighting its way through the haze of fury. Why had Grey told him? There was the obviousâ€”the reason heâ€™d hit the man by sheer reflex, the reason he was shaking now. Because Grey had told him the truth.

â€œWe were both fucking you.â€ He breathed hard and deep, fast enough to make him giddy, but it stopped the shaking and he slowed a little; his horseâ€™s ears were laid back, twitching in agitation.

â€œItâ€™s all right, a bhalaich,â€ he said, still breathing hard but slower now. â€œItâ€™s all right.â€

He thought for a moment that he might vomit, but managed not to, and settled back in the saddle, steadier.

He could still touch it, that raw place Jack Randall had left on his soul. Heâ€™d thought it so well scarred over that he was safe now, but, no, bloody John Grey had torn it open with five words. â€œWe were both fucking you.â€ And he couldnâ€™t blame him for itâ€”oughtnâ€™t to, anyway, he thought, reason doggedly fighting back the fury, though he knew only too well how weak a weapon reason was against that specter. Grey couldnâ€™t have known what those words had done to him.

Reason had its uses, though. It was reason that reminded him of the second blow. The first had been blind reflex; the second wasnâ€™t. Thought of it brought anger, too, and pain, but of a different sort.

â€œI have had carnal knowledge of your wife.â€

â€œYou bugger,â€ he whispered, clutching the reins with a reflexive violence that made the horse jerk its head, startled. â€œWhy? Why did ye tell me that, ye bugger!â€

And the second answer came belatedly, but as clearly as the first: Because sheâ€™d tell me, the minute she had a chance. And he kent that fine. He thought if Iâ€™d do violence when I heard, best I do it to him.

Aye, she would have told him. He swallowed. And she will tell me. What might he sayâ€”or doâ€”when she did?

He was trembling again and had slowed inadvertently, so the horse was nearly at a walk, head turning from side to side as it snuffed the air.

Itâ€™s nay her fault. I know that. Itâ€™s nay her fault. Theyâ€™d thought him dead. He knew what that abyss looked like; heâ€™d lived there for a long while. And he understood what desperation and strong drink could do. But the visionâ€”or the lack of one . . . How did it happen? Where? Knowing it had happened was bad enough; not knowing the how and the why of it from her was almost unbearable.

The horse had stopped; the reins hung slack. Jamie was sitting in the middle of the road, eyes closed, just breathing, trying not to imagine, trying to pray.

Reason had limits; prayer didnâ€™t. It took a little while for his mind to relax its grip, its wicked curiosity, its lust to know. But, after a bit, he felt he could go on and gathered up the reins again.

All that could wait. But he needed to see Claire before he did anything else. Just now he had no idea what he would sayâ€”or doâ€”when he saw her, but he needed to see her, with the same sort of need that a man might feel whoâ€™d been cast away at sea, marooned without food or water for weeks on end.





JOHN GREYâ€™S BLOOD was thrumming in his ears so loudly that he barely heard the discussion among his captors, whoâ€”having taken the elementary precautions of searching him and tying his hands together in front of himâ€”had gathered into a knot a few yards away and were heatedly hissing at one another like geese in a barnyard, casting occasional hostile glares in his direction.

He didnâ€™t care. He couldnâ€™t see out of his left eye and he was by now quite certain that his liver was ruptured, but he didnâ€™t care about that, either. Heâ€™d told Jamie Fraser the truthâ€”the whole bloody truthâ€”and felt the same fierce constellation of feelings that attends victory in battle: the bone-deep relief of being alive, the giddy surge of emotion that carries you on a wave much like drunkenness, then ebbs and leaves you staggering light-headed on the beachâ€”and an absolute inability to count the cost â€™til later.

His knees experienced much the same post-battle sensations and gave way. He sat down unceremoniously in the leaves and closed his good eye.

After a short interval in which he was aware of nothing much beyond the gradual slowing of his heart, the thrumming noise in his ears began to abate, and he noticed that someone was calling his name.

â€œLord Grey!â€ the voice said again, louder, and close enough that he felt a warmly fetid gust of tobacco-laden breath on his face.

â€œMy name is not Lord Grey,â€ he said, rather crossly, opening his eye. â€œI told you.â€

â€œYou said you were Lord John Grey,â€ his interlocutor said, frowning through a mat of grizzled facial hair. It was the large man in the filthy hunting shirt who had first discovered him with Fraser.

â€œI am. If you bloody have to talk to me, call me â€˜my lord,â€™ or just â€˜sir,â€™ if you like. What do you want?â€

The man reared back a little, looking indignant.

â€œWell, since you ask . . . sir, first off, we want to know if this elder brother of yours is Major General Charles Grey.â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œNo?â€ The manâ€™s unkempt eyebrows drew together. â€œDo you know Major General Charles Grey? Is he kin to you?â€

â€œYes, he is. Heâ€™s . . .â€ Grey tried to calculate the precise degree, but gave it up and flapped a hand. â€œCousin of some sort.â€

There was a satisfied rumble from the faces now peering down at him. The man called Woodbine squatted down next to him, a square of folded paper in his hand.

â€œLord John,â€ he said, more or less politely. â€œYou said that you donâ€™t hold an active commission in His Majestyâ€™s army at present?â€

â€œThatâ€™s correct.â€ Grey fought back a sudden unexpected urge to yawn. The excitement in his blood had died away now and he wanted to lie down.

â€œThen would you care to explain these documents, my lord? We found them in your breeches.â€ He unfolded the papers carefully and held them under Greyâ€™s nose.



John peered at them with his working eye. The note on top was from General Clintonâ€™s adjutant: a brief request for Grey to attend upon the general at his earliest convenience. Yes, heâ€™d seen that, though heâ€™d barely glanced at it before the cataclysmic arrival of Jamie Fraser, risen from the dead, had driven it from his mind. Despite what had occurred in the meantime, he couldnâ€™t help smiling. Alive. The bloody man was alive!

Then Woodbine took the note away, revealing the paper beneath: the document that had come attached to Clintonâ€™s note. It was a small piece of paper, bearing a red wax seal and instantly identifiable; it was an officerâ€™s warrant, his proof of commission, to be carried on his person at all times. Grey blinked at it in simple disbelief, the spidery clerkâ€™s writing wavering before his eyes. But written at the bottom, below the Kingâ€™s signature, was another, this one executed in a bold, black, all-too-recognizable scrawl.

â€œHal!â€ he exclaimed. â€œYou bastard!â€



â€œTOLD YOU HE was a soldier,â€ the small man with the cracked spectacles said, eyeing Grey from under the edge of his knitted KILL! hat with an avidity that Grey found very objectionable. â€œNot just a soldier, neither; heâ€™s a spy! Why, we could hang him out oâ€™ hand, this very minute!â€

There was an outburst of noticeable enthusiasm for this course of action, quelled with some difficulty by Corporal Woodbine, who stood up and shouted louder than the proponents of immediate execution, until those espousing it reluctantly fell back, muttering. Grey sat clutching the commission crumpled in his bound hands, heart hammering.

They bloody could hang him. Howe had done just that to a Continental captain named Hale, not two years before, when Hale was caught gathering intelligence while dressed as a civilian, and the Rebels would like nothing better than a chance to retaliate. William had been present, both at Haleâ€™s arrest and his execution, and had given Grey a brief account of the matter, shocking in its starkness.

William. Jesus, William! Caught up in the immediacy of the situation, Grey had had barely a thought to spare for his son. He and Fraser had absquatulated onto the roof and down a drainpipe, leaving William, clearly reeling with the shock of revelation, alone in the upstairs hallway.

No. No, not alone. Claire had been there, and the thought of her steadied him a bit. She would have been able to talk to Willie, calm him, explain . . . well, possibly not explain, and possibly not calm, eitherâ€”but at least if Grey was hanged in the next few minutes, William wouldnâ€™t be left to face things entirely alone.

â€œWeâ€™re taking him back to camp,â€ Woodbine was saying doggedly, not for the first time. â€œWhat good would it do to hang him here?â€

â€œOne less redcoat? Seems like a good thing to me!â€ riposted the burly thug in the hunting shirt.

â€œNow, Gershon, Iâ€™m not saying as how we shouldnâ€™t hang him. I said, not here and now.â€ Woodbine, musket held in both hands, looked slowly round the circle of men, fixing each one with his gaze. â€œNot here, not now,â€ he repeated. Grey admired Woodbineâ€™s force of character and narrowly kept himself from nodding agreement.

â€œWeâ€™re taking him back to camp. You all heard what he said; Major General Charles Greyâ€™s kin to him. Might be as Colonel Smith will want to hang him in campâ€”or might even be as heâ€™ll want to send this man to General Wayne. Remember Paoli!â€

â€œRemember Paoli!â€ Ragged cries echoed the call, and Grey rubbed at his swollen eye with his sleeveâ€”tears were leaking from it and irritating his face. Paoli? What the devil was Paoli? And what had it to do with whether, when, or how he should be hanged? He decided not to ask at just this moment and, when they hauled him to his feet, went along with them without complaint.





HOMO EST OBLIGAMUS AEROBE (â€œMAN IS AN OBLIGATE AEROBEâ€)â€”HIPPOCRATES

THE DUKEâ€™S FACE WAS dangerously flushed when Number Thirty-Nine ceremoniously opened the sedan chairâ€™s door, and not, I thought, from the heat.

â€œYou wanted to see your brother, did you not?â€ I inquired, before he could gather enough breath to say any of the things on his mind. I gestured toward the house. â€œThis is his house.â€ The fact that John was not presently in the house could wait.

He gave me a marked look, but he was still short of breath and wisely saved it, irritably waving off Number Fortyâ€™s helping hand as he struggled out of the sedan chair. He did pay the chairmenâ€”rather fortunate, as I hadnâ€™t any more money with meâ€”and, wheezing, bowed and offered me his arm. I took it, not wanting him to fall on his face in the front garden. Germain, who had kept up with the chair without noticeable effort, followed at a tactful distance.

Mrs. Figg was standing in the front doorway, watching our approach with interest. The broken door was now lying on a pair of trestles next to a camellia bush, having been removed from its hinges, and was presumably awaiting some sort of professional attention.

â€œMay I present Mrs. Mortimer Figg, Your Grace?â€ I said politely, with a nod in her direction. â€œMrs. Figg is his lordshipâ€™s cook and housekeeper. Mrs. Figg, this is His Grace, the Duke of Pardloe. Lord Johnâ€™s brother.â€



I saw her lips form the words â€œMerde on toast,â€ but fortunately without sound. She moved nimbly down the steps despite her bulk and took Hal by the other arm, shoring him up, as he was beginning to turn blue again.

â€œPurse your lips and blow,â€ I said shortly. â€œNow!â€ He made an ugly choking noise but did start blowing, though making evil grimaces in my direction.

â€œWhat in the name of the everlasting Holy Ghost did you do to him?â€ Mrs. Figg asked me accusingly. â€œSounds like heâ€™s about to die.â€

â€œSaved his life, to start with,â€ I snapped. â€œUps-a-daisy, Your Grace!â€ and between us we hoicked him up the steps. â€œThen I saved him from being stoned and beaten by a mobâ€”with Germainâ€™s invaluable help,â€ I added, glancing back at Germain, who grinned hugely. I was also in the act of abducting him, but I thought we neednâ€™t go into that.

â€œAnd Iâ€™m about to save his life again, I think,â€ I said, pausing on the porch to pant for a moment myself. â€œHave we a bedroom we can put him in? Williamâ€™s, perhaps?â€

â€œWillâ€”â€ the duke began, but then started to cough spasmodically, going a nasty shade of puce. â€œWhâ€”whâ€”â€

â€œOh, I was forgetting,â€ I said. â€œOf course, Williamâ€™s your nephew, isnâ€™t he? Heâ€™s not here just now.â€ I looked narrowly at Mrs. Figg, who snorted briefly but said nothing. â€œBlow, Your Grace.â€

Inside, I saw that some progress had been made toward restoring order. The debris had been swept into a neat pile by the open doorway, and Jenny Murray was sitting on an ottoman beside it, picking unbroken crystals from the fallen chandelier out of the rubbish and dropping them into a bowl. She lifted an eyebrow at me but rose unhurriedly to her feet, putting the bowl aside.

â€œWhat dâ€™ye need, Claire?â€ she said.

â€œBoiling water,â€ I said, grunting slightly as we maneuvered Pardloeâ€”he was lean and fine-boned, like John, but a solid man, nonethelessâ€”into a wing chair. â€œMrs. Figg? Cups, several cups, and, Jenny, my medicine chest. Donâ€™t lose your rhythm, Your Graceâ€”blow . . . two . . . three . . . fourâ€”donâ€™t gasp. Sip the airâ€”youâ€™ll get enough, I promise.â€ Halâ€™s face was twitching, shining with sweat, and while he still had control over himself, I could see panic creasing the lines around his eyes as his airways closed.

I fought down a similar sense of panic; it wouldnâ€™t serve either of us. The fact was that he could die. He was having a severe asthmatic attack, and even with access to epinephrine injections and the facilities of a major hospital, people did die in such circumstances, whether of a heart attack brought on by stress and lack of oxygen or from simple suffocation.

His hands were clenched on his knees, the moleskin breeches crumpled and dark with sweat, and the cords of his neck stood out with strain. With some difficulty, I pried one of his hands loose and grasped it strongly in mine; I had to distract him from the panic darkening his mind, if he was to have any chance at all.

â€œLook at me,â€ I said, leaning close and looking straight into his eyes. â€œItâ€™s going to be all right. Do you hear me? Nod if you can hear me.â€

He managed a short nod. He was blowing, but too fast; no more than a wisp of air touched my cheek. I squeezed his hand.



â€œSlower,â€ I said, my voice as calm as I could make it. â€œBreathe with me, now. Purse your lips . . . blow . . .â€ I tapped out a regular count of four on his knee with my free hand, as slow as I dared. He ran out of air between two and three but kept his lips pursed, straining.

â€œSlow!â€ I said sharply as his mouth opened, gasping, starving for air. â€œLet it come by itself; one . . . two . . . blow!â€ I could hear Jenny hurrying down the stairs with my medicine chest. Mrs. Figg had departed like a great rushing wind in the direction of the cookhouse, where she kept a cauldron boilingâ€”yes, here she came, three teacups looped over the fingers of one hand, a can of hot water wrapped in a towel clutched to her bosom with the other.

â€œ. . . three . . . fourâ€”joint fir, Jennyâ€”one . . . two . . . blow out, two . . . three . . . fourâ€”a good handful in each cupâ€”two, yes, thatâ€™s it . . . blow . . .â€ Still holding his gaze, willing him to blowâ€”it was all that was keeping his airways open. If he lost his rhythm, heâ€™d lose what little air pressure he had, the airways would collapse, and thenâ€”I shoved the thought aside, squeezing his hand as hard as I could, and gave disjoint directions between chanting the rhythm. Joint fir . . . what the bloody hell else did I have?

Not much, was the answer. Bowmanâ€™s root, jimsonweedâ€”much too dangerously toxic, and not fast enough. â€œSpikenard, Jenny,â€ I said abruptly. â€œThe rootâ€”grind it.â€ I pointed at the second cup, then the third. â€œ. . . two . . . three . . . four . . .â€ A large handful of crumbled joint fir (aptly named; it looked like a pile of miniature sticks) had been placed in each cup and was already steeping. Iâ€™d give him the first as soon as it had cooled enough to drink, but it took a good half hour of steeping to get a truly effective concentration. â€œMore cups, please, Mrs. Figgâ€”in, one . . . two . . . thatâ€™s good . . .â€

The hand in mine was slick with sweat, but he was gripping me with all the strength he had; I could feel my bones grind, and twisted my hand a bit to ease them. He saw and released the pressure a little. I leaned in, cradling his hand in both of mineâ€”not incidentally taking the opportunity to get my fingers on his pulse.

â€œYou arenâ€™t going to die,â€ I said to him, quietly but as forcefully as I could. â€œI wonâ€™t let you.â€ The flicker of something much too faint to be a smile passed behind those winter-sharp blue eyes, but he hadnâ€™t enough breath even to think of speaking. His lips were still blue and his face paper-white, in spite of the temperature.

The first cup of joint-fir tea helped briefly, the heat and moisture doing as much as the herb; joint fir did contain epinephrine and was the only really good treatment for asthma I had availableâ€”but there wasnâ€™t enough of the active principle in a cup of the stuff after only ten minutesâ€™ brewing. Even the momentary sense of relief steadied him, though. His hand turned, fingers linking with mine, and he squeezed back.

A fighter. I knew one when I saw one and smiled involuntarily.

â€œStart three more cups, please, Jenny?â€ If he drank them slowlyâ€”and he couldnâ€™t do more than sip briefly between gaspsâ€”and continuously, we should have got a decent amount of stimulant into him by the end of the sixth, most-concentrated cup. â€œAnd, Mrs. Figg, if you would boil three handfuls of the joint fir and half that of spikenard in a pint of coffee for a quarter hour, then let it steep?â€ If he wasnâ€™t going to die, I wanted a concentrated tincture of Ephedra easily on hand; this obviously wasnâ€™t his first attack, andâ€”if it wasnâ€™t his lastâ€”thereâ€™d be another sometime. And quite possibly sometime soon.

The back of my mind had been ticking through diagnostic possibilities, and now that I was fairly sure he was going to survive the moment, I could spare time to think about them consciously.

Sweat was pouring down the fine-cut bones of his face; Iâ€™d got his coat, waistcoat, and leather stock off first thing, and his shirtfront was pasted to his chest, his breeches black-wet in the creases of his groin. No wonder, though, between the heat of the day, his exertions, and the hot tea. The blue tinge was fading from his lips, and there was no sign of edema in face or hands . . . no distention of the blood vessels in his neck, in spite of his effort.

I could hear the crackling rales in his lungs easily without a stethoscope, but he showed no thoracic enlargement; his torso was as trim as Johnâ€™s, a bit narrower through the chest. Probably not a chronic obstructive pulmonary condition, then . . . and I didnâ€™t think he had congestive heart failure. His color when I met him had been good, and his pulse was presently thumping against my fingers very steadily, fast, but no flutters, no arrhythmia . . .

I became aware of Germain hovering by my elbow, staring interestedly at the duke, who was now sufficiently himself as to lift an eyebrow in the boyâ€™s direction, though still unable to speak.

â€œMmm?â€ I said, before resuming my now-automatic counting of breaths.

â€œIâ€™m only thinking, Grand-mÃ¨re, as how himself thereâ€â€”Germain nodded at Pardloeâ€”â€œmight be missed. Had I maybe best carry a message to someone, so as they arenâ€™t sending out soldiers after him? The chairmen will talk, will they not?â€

â€œAh.â€ That was a thought, all right. General Clinton, for one, certainly knew that Pardloe was in my company when last seen. I had no idea with whom Pardloe might be traveling or whether he was in command of his regiment. If he was, people would be looking for him right now; an officer couldnâ€™t be gone from his place for long without someone noticing.

And Germainâ€”an observant lad, if ever there was oneâ€”was right about the chairmen. Their numbers meant they were registered with the central chairmenâ€™s agency in Philadelphia; it would be the work of a moment for the generalâ€™s staff to locate numbers Thirty-Nine and Forty and find out where theyâ€™d delivered the Duke of Pardloe.

Jenny, who had been tending the array of teacups, stepped in now with the next and knelt by Pardloe, nodding to me that she would see to his breathing while I talked to Germain.

â€œHe told the chairmen to bring me to the Kingâ€™s Arms,â€ I said to Germain, taking him out onto the porch, where we could confer unheard. â€œAnd I met him at General Clintonâ€™s office in theâ€”â€

â€œI ken where it is, Grand-mÃ¨re.â€

â€œI daresay you do. Have you something in mind?â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™m thinkinâ€™â€”â€ He glanced into the house, then back at me, eyes narrowed in thought. â€œHow long dâ€™ye mean to keep him prisoner, Grand-mÃ¨re?â€



So my motives hadnâ€™t escaped Germain. I wasnâ€™t surprised; he undoubtedly had heard all about the dayâ€™s excitements from Mrs. Figgâ€”and, knowing as he did who Jamie was, had probably deduced even more. I wondered if heâ€™d seen William. If so, he likely knew everything. If he didnâ€™t, though, there was no need to reveal that little complication until it was necessary.

â€œUntil your grandfather comes back,â€ I said. â€œOr possibly Lord John,â€ I added as an afterthought. I hoped with all my being that Jamie would come back shortly. But it might be that he would find it necessary to stay outside the city and send John in to bring me news. â€œThe minute I let the duke go, heâ€™ll be turning the city upside down in search of his brother. Always assuming for the sake of argument that he doesnâ€™t drop dead in the process.â€ And the very last thing I wanted was to instigate a dragnet in which Jamie might be snared.

Germain rubbed his chin thoughtfullyâ€”a peculiar gesture in a child too young for whiskers, but his father to the life, and I smiled.

â€œThatâ€™s maybe not too long,â€ he said. â€œGrand-pÃ¨re will come back directly; he was wild to see ye last night.â€ He grinned at me, then looked through the open doorway, pursing his lips.

â€œAs to himself, ye canna hide where he is,â€ he said. â€œBut if ye were to send a note to the general, and maybe another to the Kingâ€™s Arms, saying as how His Grace was staying with Lord John, they wouldna start searching for him right away. And even if someone was to come here later and inquire, I suppose ye might give him a wee dram that would keep him quiet so ye could tell them he was gone. Or maybe lock him in a closet? Tied up wiâ€™ a gag if it should be heâ€™s got his voice back by then,â€ he added. Germain was a very logical, thorough-minded sort of person; he got it from Marsali.

â€œExcellent thought,â€ I said, forbearing to comment on the relative merits of the options for keeping Pardloe incommunicado. â€œLet me do that now.â€

Pausing for a quick look at Pardloe, who was doing better though still wheezing strongly, I whipped upstairs and flipped open Johnâ€™s writing desk. It was the work of a moment to mix the ink powder and write the notes. I hesitated briefly over the signature but then caught sight of Johnâ€™s signet on the dressing table; he hadnâ€™t had time to put it on.

The thought gave me a slight pang; in the overwhelming joy of seeing Jamie alive, and then the shock of Williamâ€™s advent, Jamieâ€™s taking John hostage, and the violence of Williamâ€™s exitâ€”dear Lord, where was William now?â€”I had pushed John to the back of my mind.

Still, I told myself, he was quite safe. Jamie wouldnâ€™t let any harm come to him, and directly he came back into Philadelphiaâ€”the chiming of the carriage clock on the mantelpiece interrupted me, and I glanced at it: four oâ€™clock.

â€œTime flies when youâ€™re having fun,â€ I murmured to myself, and, scribbling a reasonable facsimile of Johnâ€™s signature, I lit the candle from the embers in the hearth, dripped wax on the folded notes, and stamped them with the smiling half-moon ring. Maybe John would be back before the notes were even delivered. And Jamie, surely, would be with me as soon as darkness made it safe.





A TIDE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN

JAMIE WASNâ€™T ALONE on the road. Heâ€™d been dimly aware of horses passing by, heard the distant talk of men on foot, but now that heâ€™d come out of his red haze, he was startled to see how many there were. He saw what was plainly a militia companyâ€”not marching, but on the move as a body, knots and clumps of men, solitary ridersâ€”and a few wagons coming from the city, piled with goods, women and children afoot beside them.

Heâ€™d seen a few folk leaving Philadelphia when heâ€™d come in the day beforeâ€”God, was it only yesterday?â€”and thought to ask Fergus about it, but in the excitement of arrival and the later complications had quite forgotten.

His sense of disturbance increased and he kicked up his horse to a faster pace. It was no more than ten miles to the city; heâ€™d be there long before nightfall.

Maybe just as well if itâ€™s dark, he thought grimly. Easier to have things out with Claire alone and undisturbedâ€”and whether the having-out led to beating or bed, he wanted no interference.

The thought was like the striking of one of Briannaâ€™s matches. Just the word â€œbedâ€ and he was aflame with fresh rage.

â€œIfrinn!â€ he said aloud, and slammed his fist against the pommel. All the trouble to calm himself, and all to waste in an instant! God damn itâ€”damn him, damn her, John Greyâ€”damn everything!

â€œMr. Fraser!â€

He jerked as though shot in the back, and the horse slowed at once, snorting.

â€œMr. Fraser!â€ came the loud, wheezy voice again, and Daniel Morgan came trotting up alongside on a small, sturdy bay, grinning all over his big scarred face. â€œKnew that was you, knew it! Ainâ€™t no other rascal that size with that color hair, and if there is one, I donâ€™t want to meet him.â€

â€œColonel Morgan,â€ he said, noting auld Danâ€™s unaccustomed uniform with the fresh insignia on the collar. â€œOn your way to a wedding?â€ He did his best to smile, though the turmoil inside him was like the whirlpools off the rocks of Stroma.

â€œWhat? Oh, that,â€ said Dan, trying to look sideways down his own neck. â€œPshaw. Washingtonâ€™s a damned stickler for â€˜proper dress.â€™ The Continental army got more generals than they got private soldiers, these days. An officer lives through more â€™n two battles, they make him some kind of general on the spot. Now, gettinâ€™ any pay for it, thatâ€™s a different kettle of fish.â€



He tipped back his hat and looked Jamie up and down.

â€œJust come back from Scotland? Heard you went with Brigadier Fraserâ€™s bodyâ€”your kin, I suppose?â€ He shook his head regretfully. â€œCryinâ€™ shame. Fine soldier, good man.â€

â€œAye, he was that. We buried him near his home at Balnain.â€

They continued together, auld Dan asking questions and Jamie replying as briefly as good mannersâ€”and his real affection for Morganâ€”would allow. They hadnâ€™t met since Saratoga, where heâ€™d served under Morgan as an officer of his Rifle Corps, and there was a good deal to say. Still, he was glad of the company, and even of the questions; they distracted him and kept his mind from catapulting him again into fruitless fury and confusion.

â€œI suppose we must part here,â€ Jamie said, after a bit. They were approaching a crossroads, and Dan had slowed his pace a bit. â€œIâ€™m bound into the city myself.â€

â€œWhat for?â€ Morgan asked, rather surprised.

â€œIâ€”to see my wife.â€ His voice wanted to tremble on the word â€œwife,â€ and he bit it off sharp.

â€œOh, yes? Could you maybe spare a quarter hour?â€ Dan was giving him a sort of calculating look that made Jamie instantly uneasy. But the sun was still high; he didnâ€™t want to enter Philadelphia before dark.

â€œAye, maybe,â€ he replied cautiously. â€œTo do what?â€

â€œIâ€™m on my way to see a friendâ€”want you to meet him. Itâ€™s right close, wonâ€™t take a moment. Come on!â€ Morgan veered right, waving at Jamie to follow, which, cursing himself for a fool, he did.

Number 17 Chestnut Street

I WAS SWEATING as freely as the duke was by the time the spasm eased enough for him to breathe without the positive-pressure exercise. I wasnâ€™t quite as tired as he wasâ€”he lay back in the chair, exhausted, eyes closed, drawing slow, shallowâ€”but free!â€”breathsâ€”but close. I felt light-headed, too; itâ€™s not possible to help someone breathe without doing a lot of it yourself, and I was hyperventilated.

â€œHere, a piuthar-chÃ¨ile.â€ Jennyâ€™s voice spoke by my ear, and it was only when I opened my eyes in surprise that I realized theyâ€™d been closed. She put a small glass of brandy in my hand. â€œThereâ€™s nay whisky in the house, but I expect this will help. Shall I give His Grace a dram, too?â€

â€œYes, you shall,â€ the duke said, with great authority, though he didnâ€™t move a muscle or open his eyes. â€œThank you, madam.â€

â€œIt wonâ€™t hurt him,â€ I said, drawing myself up and stretching my back. â€œOr you, either. Sit down and have a drink. You, too, Mrs. Figg.â€ Jenny and Mrs. Figg had worked nearly as hard as I had, fetching and grinding and brewing, bringing cool cloths to mop the sweat, spelling me now and then with the counting, and, by combining their not-inconsiderable force of will with mine, helping to keep him alive.

Mrs. Figg had very fixed notions of what was proper, and these didnâ€™t include sitting down to share a dram with her employer, let alone a visiting duke, but even she was obliged to admit that the circumstances were unusual. Glass in hand, she perched primly on an ottoman near the parlor door, where she could deal with any potential invasions or domestic emergencies.

No one spoke for some time, but there was a great sense of peace in the room. The hot, still air carried that sense of odd camaraderie that binds people who have passed through a trial togetherâ€”if only temporarily. I gradually became aware that the air was carrying noises, too, from the street outside. Groups of people moving hurriedly, shouts from the next block, and a rumble of wagons. And a distant rattle of drums.

Mrs. Figg was aware of it, too; I saw her head rise, the ribbons of her cap atremble with inquisitiveness.

â€œBaby Jesus, have mercy,â€ she said, setting down her empty glass with care. â€œSomethingâ€™s coming.â€

Jenny looked startled and glanced at me, apprehensive.

â€œComing?â€ she said. â€œWhatâ€™s coming?â€

â€œThe Continental army, I expect,â€ said Pardloe. He let his head fall back, sighing. â€œDear God. What it is . . . to draw breath.â€ His breath was still short, but not very much constrained. He raised his glass ceremoniously to me. â€œThank you, my . . . dear. I was . . . already in your debt for your . . . kind services to my son, butâ€”â€

â€œWhat do you mean, â€˜the Continental armyâ€™?â€ I interrupted. I set down my own glass, now empty. My heart rate had calmed after the exertions of the last hour but now abruptly sped up again.

Pardloe closed one eye and regarded me with the other.

â€œThe Americans,â€ he said mildly. â€œThe Rebels. What else . . . would I mean?â€

â€œAnd when you say, â€˜coming . . .â€™â€ I said carefully.

â€œI didnâ€™t,â€ he pointed out, then nodded at Mrs. Figg. â€œShe did. Sheâ€™s right, though. General Clintonâ€™s . . . forces are with . . . drawing from Philadelphia. . . . I daresay Wa . . . Washington is . . . poised to rush in.â€

Jenny made a small sputtering noise, and Mrs. Figg said something really blasphemous in French, then clapped a broad pink-palmed hand to her mouth.

â€œOh,â€ I said, doubtless sounding as blank as I felt. Iâ€™d been so distracted during my meeting with Clinton earlier in the day that the logical consequences of a British withdrawal had not occurred to me at all.

Mrs. Figg stood up.

â€œI best go and be burying the silver, then,â€ she said in a matter-of-fact sort of way. â€œItâ€™ll be under the laburnum bush by the cookhouse, Lady John.â€

â€œWait,â€ I said, raising a hand. â€œI donâ€™t think we need do that just yet, Mrs. Figg. The army hasnâ€™t yet left the city; the Americans arenâ€™t precisely snapping at our heels. And weâ€™ll need a few forks with which to eat our supper.â€

She made a low rumbling noise in her throat but seemed to see the sense in this; she nodded and began to collect the brandy glasses instead.

â€œWhatâ€™ll you be wanting for supper, then? I got a cold boiled ham, but I was thinking to make a chicken fricassee, William liking that so much.â€ She cast a bleak look at the hallway, where the bloody smudges on the wallpaper had now turned brown. â€œYou think heâ€™s coming back for his supper?â€ William had an official billet somewhere in the town, but frequently spent the night at the houseâ€”particularly when Mrs. Figg was making chicken fricassee.

â€œGod knows,â€ I said. I hadnâ€™t had time to contemplate the William situation, what with everything else. Might he come back, when heâ€™d cooled down, determined to have things out with John? Iâ€™d seen a Fraser on the boil, many times, and they didnâ€™t sulk, as a rule. They tended to take direct action, at once. I eyed Jenny speculatively; she returned the look and casually leaned her elbow on the table, chin in hand, and tapped her fingers thoughtfully against her lips. I smiled privately at her.

â€œWhere is my nephew?â€ Hal asked, finally able to take note of something other than his next breath. â€œFor that matter . . . where is my brother?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I told him, putting my own glass on Mrs. Figgâ€™s tray and scooping his up to add to it. â€œI really wasnâ€™t lying about that. But I do expect heâ€™ll be back soon.â€ I rubbed a hand over my face and smoothed my hair back as well as I could. First things first. I had a patient to tend.

â€œIâ€™m sure John wants to see you as much as you want to see him. Butâ€”â€

â€œOh, I doubt it,â€ the duke said. His eyes traveled slowly over me, from bare feet to disheveled hair, and the faint look of amusement on his face deepened. â€œYou must tell me how John . . . happened to marry you . . . when thereâ€™s time.â€

â€œA counsel of desperation,â€ I said shortly. â€œBut in the meantime we must get you to bed. Mrs. Figg, is the back bedroomâ€”â€

â€œThank you, Mrs. Figg,â€ the duke interrupted, â€œI shanâ€™t be . . . requiring . . .â€ He was trying to struggle up out of the chair and hadnâ€™t enough breath to talk. I walked up to him and gave him my best piercing head-matron look.

â€œHarold,â€ I said in measured tones. â€œI am not merely your sister-in-law.â€ The term gave me an odd frisson, but I ignored it. â€œI am your physician. If you donâ€™tâ€”what?â€ I demanded. He was staring up at me with a most peculiar expression on his face, something between surprise and amusement. â€œYou invited me to use your Christian name, didnâ€™t you?â€

â€œI did,â€ he admitted. â€œBut I donâ€™t think anyone has . . . actually called me Harold since . . . I was three years old.â€ He did smile then, a charming smile quite his own. â€œThe family call me Hal.â€

â€œHal, then,â€ I said, smiling back but refusing to be distracted. â€œYouâ€™re going to have a nice refreshing sponge bath, Hal, and then youâ€™re going to bed.â€

He laughedâ€”though he cut it short, as he began to wheeze. He coughed a little, fist balled under his ribs, and looked uneasy, but it stopped, and he cleared his throat and glanced up at me.

â€œYouâ€™d think I was . . . three years old. Sister-in-law. Trying to send me . . . to bed without my tea?â€ He pressed himself gingerly upright, getting his feet under him. I put a hand on his chest and pushed. He hadnâ€™t any strength in his legs and fell back into the chair, astonished and affronted. And afraid: he hadnâ€™t realizedâ€”or at least had not admittedâ€”his own weakness. A severe attack usually left the victim completely drained, and often with the lungs still dangerously twitchy.

â€œYou see?â€ I said, tempering my tone with gentleness. â€œYouâ€™ve had attacks like this before, havenâ€™t you?â€

â€œWell . . . yes,â€ he said unwillingly, â€œbut . . .â€

â€œAnd how long were you in bed after the last one?â€

His lips compressed.

â€œA week. But the fool doctorâ€”â€

I put a hand on his shoulder and he stoppedâ€”as much because heâ€™d temporarily run short of air as because of the touch.

â€œYou. Cannot. Breathe. Yet. On. Your. Own,â€ I said, separating the words for emphasis. â€œListen to me, Hal. Look whatâ€™s happened this afternoon, will you? You had a fairly severe attack in the street; had that crowd on Fourth Street decided to set upon us, you would have been quite helplessâ€”donâ€™t argue with me, Hal, I was there.â€ I narrowed my eyes at him. He did the same back at me but didnâ€™t argue.

â€œThen the walk from the street to the door of the houseâ€”a distance of some twenty feetâ€”threw you straight into a full-blown status asthmaticus; have you heard that term before?â€

â€œNo,â€ he muttered.

â€œWell, now you have, and now you know what it is. And you were in bed for a week the last time? Was it as bad as this?â€

His lips were a thin line and his eyes sparking. I imagined most people didnâ€™t speak to a dukeâ€”let alone the commander of his own regimentâ€”like this. Be good for him, I thought.

â€œBloody doctor . . . said it was my heart.â€ His fist had uncurled and the fingers were slowly rubbing his chest. â€œKnew it wasnâ€™t that.â€

â€œI think youâ€™re probably right about that,â€ I conceded. â€œWas this the same doctor who gave you smelling salts? Complete quack, if so.â€

He laughed, a brief, breathless sound.

â€œYes, he is.â€ He paused to breathe for a moment. â€œThough in . . . justice, he . . . he didnâ€™t give me . . . salts. Got them . . . myself. For fainting . . . told you.â€

â€œSo you did.â€ I sat down beside him and took hold of his wrist. He let me, watching curiously. His pulse was fine; it had slowed and was thumping along very steadily.

â€œHow long have you been subject to fainting spells?â€ I asked, bending to look closely into his eyes. No sign of petechial hemorrhage, no jaundice, pupils the same size . . .

â€œA long time,â€ he said, and pulled his wrist abruptly away. â€œI havenâ€™t time to chat about my health, madam. Iâ€”â€

â€œClaire,â€ I said, and put a restraining hand on his chest, smiling amiably at him. â€œYouâ€™re Hal, Iâ€™m Claireâ€”and you arenâ€™t going anywhere, Your Grace.â€

â€œTake your hand off me!â€

â€œIâ€™m seriously tempted to do just that and let you fall on your face,â€ I told him, â€œbut wait until Mrs. Figg finishes brewing the tincture. I donâ€™t want you thrashing about on the floor, gasping like a landed fish, and no way of getting the hook out of your mouth.â€



I did in fact take my hand off his chest, though, and, rising, I went out into the hall before he could find breath to say anything. Jenny had taken up a stand by the open doorway, looking up and down the street.

â€œWhatâ€™s going on out there?â€ I asked.

â€œI dinna ken,â€ she said, not taking her eyes off a couple of rough-looking men who were lounging down the other side of the street. â€œBut I dinna like the feel of it a bit. Dâ€™ye think heâ€™s right?â€

â€œThat the British army is leaving? Yes. They are. And very likely half the Loyalists in the city with them.â€ I knew exactly what she meant by not liking the feel of things. The air was hot and thick, buzzing with cicadas, and the leaves of the chestnut trees along the street hung limp as dishrags. But something was moving in the atmosphere. Excitement? Panic? Fear? All three, I thought.

â€œHad I best go to the printshop, dâ€™ye think?â€ she asked, turning to me with a slight frown. â€œWould Marsali and the weans be safer if I fetched them here, I mean? If there was to be a riot or the like?â€

I shook my head.

â€œI donâ€™t think so. Theyâ€™re well-known Patriots. Itâ€™s the Loyalists who will be in danger, if the British army is leaving. They wonâ€™t have any protection, and the Rebels may well . . . do things to them. Andâ€â€”a very unpleasant feeling snaked down my backbone, like a cold, slimy fingerâ€”â€œthis is a Loyalist household.â€ â€œWithout even a door to shut and bolt,â€ I might have added, but didnâ€™t.

There was a loud thump from the parlor, as of a body hitting the floor, but Jenny didnâ€™t turn a hair, nor did I. Weâ€™d both had a lot of experience with stubborn men. I could hear him panting; if he started wheezing again, Iâ€™d go in.

â€œWill it put ye in danger, then, to have him here?â€ she asked, sotto voce, with a tilt of her head toward the parlor. â€œMaybe yeâ€™d best come to the printshop.â€

I grimaced, trying to evaluate the possibilities. The notes Iâ€™d sent with Germain would delay inquiries, and I could put off anyone who did come. But that also meant I could expect no immediate help from the army, if help was needed. And it might be; someone in that hostile crowd on Fourth Street might well have heard where Iâ€™d told the chairmen to come. That hostility now showed itself in a different light.

If the Rebels in the city were about to rise and turn upon the defenseless Loyalistsâ€”and the currents I sensed beginning to swirl through the streets were dark onesâ€”

â€œSomeone might just show up on your porch wiâ€™ a keg of tar and a bag oâ€™ feathers,â€ Jenny observed, preempting my thought in a most unnerving way.

â€œWell, that wouldnâ€™t help His Graceâ€™s asthma a bit,â€ I said, and she laughed.

â€œHad ye maybe better give him back to General Clinton?â€ she suggested. â€œIâ€™ve had soldiers search my house, wiâ€™ a wanted man hidinâ€™ in the bottom oâ€™ my wardrobe and my newborn bairn in his arms. I dinna think it would be a great deal easier on the nerves to have the Sons oâ€™ Liberty come in here after His Grace, if half what Marsali told me about them is true.â€

â€œIt probably is.â€ A gunshot smacked through the heavy air, flat and dull, from somewhere near the river, and we both tensed. It wasnâ€™t repeated, though, and after a moment I drew breath again.

â€œThe thing is, heâ€™s not stable. I canâ€™t risk taking him through streets filled with dust and tree pollen and then leaving him in the care of an army surgeon, or even that quack Hebdy. Were he to have another attack and no one able to get him through it . . .â€

Jenny grimaced.

â€œAye, yeâ€™re right,â€ she said reluctantly. â€œAnd ye canna leave him here and go yourself, for the same reason.â€

â€œThatâ€™s right.â€ And Jamie would be coming here, to find me. I wouldnâ€™t leave.

â€œKen, if Jamie came and didna find ye here, heâ€™d go to the printshop next thing,â€ Jenny observed, making the hair prickle on the back of my neck.

â€œWill you stop doing that!?â€

â€œWhat?â€ she said, startled.

â€œReading my mind!â€

â€œOh, that.â€ She grinned at me, blue eyes creasing into triangles. â€œEverything ye think shows on your face, Claire. Surely Jamieâ€™s told ye that?â€

A deep flush burned upward from my low-cut dÃ©colletage, and only then did I recall that I was still wearing the amber-colored silk, which was now soaked with sweat, rimed with dust, and altogether rather the worse for wear. And which had very tight stays. I rather hoped that everything I was thinking didnâ€™t show on my face, because there was quite a bit of information I didnâ€™t mean to share with Jenny just yet.

â€œWell, I canna tell everything ye think,â€ she admittedâ€”doing it again, dammit!â€”â€œbut itâ€™s easy to tell when yeâ€™re thinking about Jamie.â€

I decided that I really didnâ€™t want to hear what I looked like when thinking about Jamie and was about to excuse myself to look in on the duke, who I could hear coughing and swearing breathlessly to himself in German, when my attention was distracted by a boy sprinting down the street as though the devil were after him, his coat on inside out and shirttails streaming.

â€œColenso!â€ I exclaimed.

â€œWhat?â€ Jenny said, startled.

â€œNot what. Who. Him,â€ I said, pointing at the grubby little creature panting up the walk. â€œColenso Baragwanath. Williamâ€™s groom.â€

Colenso, who always looked as though he should be squatting atop a toadstool, came hurtling toward the door with such violence that Jenny and I both leapt out of the way. Colenso tripped on the doorsill and fell flat on his face.

â€œYe look as though Auld Hornie himself was after ye, lad,â€ Jenny said, bending down to hoick him to his feet. â€œAnd whateverâ€™s become of your breeks?â€

Sure enough, the boy was barefoot and wearing only his shirt beneath his coat.

â€œThey took â€™em,â€ he blurted, gasping for breath.

â€œWho?â€ I said, pulling his coat off and turning it right side out again.

â€œThem,â€ he said, gesturing hopelessly toward Locust Street. â€œI put me head into the ordinary, to see was Lord Ellesmere thereâ€”he is, sometimesâ€”and there was a knot oâ€™ men all buzzinâ€™ like a hive oâ€™ bees together. They was big lads with â€™em, and one of â€™em as knew me saw me and raises up a great cry, shoutinâ€™ as Iâ€™m a-spyinâ€™ on â€™em and mean to take word back to the army, and then they grabbed me and they called me a turncoat and put me coat on backward and the one man said heâ€™d beat me and teach me not to do such as that and pulled off me breeches and . . . and . . . anyway, I squirmed out of his hand and fell down on the floor and crawled out under the tables and took off a-runninâ€™.â€ He wiped a sleeve under his runny nose. â€œHis lordship here, maâ€™am?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said. â€œWhy do you want him?â€

â€œOh, I donâ€™t, maâ€™am,â€ he assured me, with evident sincerity. â€œMajor Findlay wants him. Now.â€

â€œHmm. Well . . . wherever he is at the moment, heâ€™ll likely go back to his regular billet this evening. You know where that is, donâ€™t you?â€

â€œYes, maâ€™am, but Iâ€™m not a-goinâ€™ back in the street â€™thout my breeches!â€ He looked both horrified and indignant, and Jenny laughed.

â€œDinna blame ye a bit, lad,â€ she said. â€œTell ye what, thoughâ€”my eldest grandsonâ€™s likely got an old pair of breeches he could spare. Iâ€™ll step round to the printshop,â€ she said to me, â€œfetch the breeches, and tell Marsali whatâ€™s ado.â€

â€œAll right,â€ I said, a little reluctant to see her go. â€œBut hurry back. And tell her not to print any of this in the newspaper!â€





THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST UPON A RELUCTANT DISCIPLE

DAN MORGANâ€™S â€œITâ€ WAS nearby: a ramshackle cabin set in a little elm grove, down a short dirt lane off the main road. There was a big gray gelding hobbled and cropping grass nearby, his tack resting on the porch; he looked up briefly and whinnied at the newcomers.



Jamie ducked under the lintel after Dan and found himself in a dark, shabby room that smelled of cabbage water, grime, and the sharp reek of urine. There was one window, its shutters left open for air, and the sunlight coming in silhouetted the long-skulled head of a large man sitting at the table, who raised his head at the opening of the door.

â€œColonel Morgan,â€ he said, in a soft voice touched with the drawl of Virginia. â€œHave you brought me good news?â€

â€œThatâ€™s just what I brought you, General,â€ auld Dan said, and shoved Jamie ahead of him toward the table. â€œI found this rascal on the road and bade him come along. Thisâ€™ll be Colonel Fraser, who Iâ€™ve told you of before. Just come back from Scotland, and the very man to take command of Taylorâ€™s troops.â€

The big man had risen from the table and put out a hand, smilingâ€”though he smiled with his lips pressed tight together, as though afraid something might escape. The man was as tall as Jamie himself, and Jamie found himself looking straight into sharp gray-blue eyes that took his measure in the instant it took to shake hands.

â€œGeorge Washington,â€ the man said. â€œYour servant, sir.â€

â€œJames Fraser,â€ Jamie said, feeling mildly stunned. â€œYour . . . most obedient. Sir.â€

â€œSit with me, Colonel Fraser.â€ The big Virginian gestured toward one of the rough benches at the table. â€œMy horse pulled up lame, and my slaveâ€™s gone to find another. No notion how long it may take him, as I require a good sturdy beast to bear my weight, and those are thin on the ground these days.â€ He looked Jamie up and down with frank appraisal; they were much of a size. â€œI donâ€™t suppose you have a decent horse with you, sir?â€

â€œAye, I do.â€ It was clear what Washington expected, and Jamie yielded gracefully. â€œWill ye do me the honor to take him, General?â€

Auld Dan made a disgruntled noise and shifted from foot to foot, clearly wanting to object, but Jamie gave him a brief shake of the head. It wasnâ€™t that far to Philadelphia; he could walk.

Washington looked pleased and thanked Jamie with grace in turn, saying that the horse should be returned to him as soon as another suitable mount might be procured.

â€œBut it is somewhat necessary that I be nimble at present, Colonel,â€ Washington remarked, with an air of apology. â€œYouâ€™re aware, are you, that Clinton is withdrawing from Philadelphia?â€

A shock went through Jamie like a hot penny dropped on butter.

â€œItâ€”heâ€”no, sir. I was not aware.â€

â€œI was just about to get to that,â€ Dan said tetchily. â€œNo one lets me get one word in edgewise, I tell you.â€

â€œWell, now youâ€™ve got one,â€ Washington said, amused. â€œYou might get another, if youâ€™re quick enough to speak before Lee gets here. Sit down, gentlemen, if you will. Iâ€™m expectingâ€”ah, there they are.â€ Sounds from the dooryard indicated a number of horsemen arriving, and within a few moments the cabin was crowded with Continental officers.

They were a creased and weathered lot, for the most part, dressed in motley bits of uniform, these coupled uneasily with hunting shirts or homespun breeches. Even the complete suits of clothes were mud-spattered and worn, and the smell of men whoâ€™d been living rough quite overcame the gentler domestic reeks of the cabin.

Among the shuffling and excited greetings, Jamie spotted the source of the urinous smell, though: a thin-faced woman stood with her back pressed into a corner of the room, holding an infant wrapped in a ratty shawl against her bosom, her eyes darting to and fro among the intruders. A dark wet patch showed on the shawl, but it was plain the woman was afraid to move from her place to change the wean and instead shifted mechanically from foot to foot, patting the child to soothe it.

â€œColonel Fraser! Well met! Well met!â€ The voice jerked his attention away, and, to his astonishment, he found his hand being pumped with enthusiasm by Anthony Wayneâ€”known quite openly by now as â€œMad Anthonyâ€â€”whom he had last seen a few weeks before the fall of Ticonderoga.

â€œIs your wife well, sir, and your Indian nephew?â€ Wayne was asking, beaming up into Jamieâ€™s face. Anthony was short and stocky, with the full cheeks of a chipmunk, but also equipped with a sharp, poking sort of nose over which his eyes did now and then seem to glow with fire. At the moment, Jamie was relieved to see them merely alight with friendly interest.

â€œAll well, sir, I thank ye. Andâ€”â€

â€œTell me, is your wife near at hand?â€ Wayne moved a little closer and lowered his voice a bit. â€œIâ€™ve been having the most damnable time with my gouty foot, and she did wonders with the abscess at the base of my spine while we were at Tiâ€”â€

â€œColonel Fraser, allow me to make you acquainted with Major General Charles Lee and with General Nathanael Greene.â€ George Washingtonâ€™s voice drove a smooth Virginia wedge between himself and the base of Mad Anthonyâ€™s spine, to Jamieâ€™s relief.

Besides Washington himself, Charles Lee was the best equipped of the lot, wearing complete uniform from gorget to polished boots. Jamie hadnâ€™t met him before but could have picked him out of a crowd as a professional soldier, no matter how he was dressed. An Englishman of the sort who seemed always to be smelling something dubious, but he shook hands cordially enough, with a clipped â€œYour servant, sir.â€ Jamie knew exactly two things about Charles Lee, both told to him by Young Ian: to wit, that the man had a Mohawk wifeâ€”and that the Mohawk called him â€œOunewaterika.â€ Ian said it meant â€œBoiling Water.â€

Between Mad Anthony and Boiling Water, Jamie was beginning to feel that he should have spurred up and run for it when he met Dan Morgan on the road, but too late for regrets.

â€œSit, gentlemen, we have no time to waste.â€ Washington turned to the woman in the corner. â€œHave you anything to drink, Mrs. Hardman?â€

Jamie saw her throat move as she swallowed, squeezing the child so hard that it squealed like a piglet and started to cry. He felt several of the men, doubtless fathers, wince at the sound.

â€œNo, Friend,â€ she said, and he realized she was a Quaker. â€œNaught but water from the well. Shall I fetch you a bucket?â€



â€œDonâ€™t trouble thyself, Friend Hardman,â€ Nathanael Greene said, soft-voiced. â€œIâ€™ve two bottles in my saddlebag will do us.â€ He moved slowly toward the woman, not to startle her, and took her gently by the arm. â€œCome outside. Thee neednâ€™t be disturbed by this business.â€ He was a heavy, imposing man, who walked with a noticeable limp, but she seemed reassured by his plain speech and went with him, though looking back with an anxious face, as though fearing that the men might set fire to the place.

A quarter hour later, Jamie wasnâ€™t so sure that they might not ignite the cabin by the sheer force of their excitement. Washington and his troops had been bottled up at Valley Forge for the last six months, drilling and preparing, and the generals were on fire to be at the enemy.

Much talk, plans proposed, argued over, put aside, returned to. Jamie listened with half a mind; the other half was in Philadelphia. Heâ€™d heard enough from Fergus to know that the city was divided, with regular clashes between Patriots and Loyalists, these kept under control only by the presence of the British soldiersâ€”but the Loyalists were a minority. The moment the armyâ€™s protection was withdrawn, the Loyalists would be at the mercy of the Rebelsâ€”and Rebels who had been suppressed for months were not likely to be merciful.

And Claire . . . His mouth went dry. Claire was, so far as anyone in Philadelphia knew, the wife of Lord John Grey, a very visible Loyalist. And Jamie himself had just removed John Greyâ€™s protection from her, leaving her alone and helpless in a city about to explode.

How long did he have before the British left the city? No one at the table knew.

He took as little part as possible in the conversation, both because he was estimating how fast he could reach Philadelphia on footâ€”versus the possibility of going out to the privy and stealing back the horse heâ€™d just given Washingtonâ€”and because he hadnâ€™t forgotten what auld Dan had said to General Washington when heâ€™d dragged Jamie in here. The very last thing he wanted wasâ€”

â€œAnd you, Colonel Fraser,â€ Washington said. Jamie closed his eyes and commended his soul to God. â€œWill you do me the signal service of accepting command of Henry Taylorâ€™s battalion? General Taylor fell ill and died two days ago.â€

â€œI . . . am honored, sir,â€ Jamie managed, thinking frantically. â€œBut I have very urgent business . . . in Philadelphia. I should be happy to oblige ye, so soon as my business is accomplishedâ€”and I could, of course, bring back word of exactly how matters stand with General Clintonâ€™s forces.â€ Washington had been looking severe during the first part of this speech, but the last sentence made Greene and Morgan hum with approval and Wayne nod his little chipmunk head.

â€œCan you manage your business within three days, Colonel?â€

â€œYes, sir!â€ It was no more than ten miles to the city; he could do that in two or three hours. And it wasnâ€™t going to take him more than thirty seconds to take Claire out of that house, once he reached it.

â€œVery well, then. Youâ€™re appointed to a temporary field rank of General of the Army. Thatâ€”â€



â€œIfrinn!â€

â€œI beg your pardon, Colonel?â€ Washington looked puzzled. Dan Morgan, whoâ€™d heard Jamie say â€œHell!â€ in GÃ idhlig before, shook silently beside him.

â€œIâ€”thank ye, sir.â€ He swallowed, feeling a dizzy wave of heat pass over him.

â€œThough the Congress will have to approve your appointment,â€ Washington went on, frowning a little, â€œand thereâ€™s no guarantee as to what those contentious, shopkeeping sons of bitches will do.â€

â€œI understand, sir,â€ Jamie assured him. He could only hope. Dan Morgan passed him a bottle, and he drank deep, hardly noticing what was in it. Sweating profusely, he sank back on the bench, hoping to avoid any further notice.

Jesus, now what? Heâ€™d meant to slip quietly into the city and out again with Claire, then head south to retrieve his printing press, perhaps establish a wee business in Charleston or Savannah until the war was over and they could go home to the Ridge. But he had known there was a risk; any man below the age of sixty could be compelled into militia service, and if it came down to it, he was likely a little safer being a general than a commander of militia. Maybe. And a general could resign; that was a heartening thought.

Despite all the talk and the worrying prospects of the immediate future, Jamie found himself paying more attention to Washingtonâ€™s face than to what he said, taking note of how the man talked and carried himself, so that he could tell Claire. He wished that he could tell Brianna; she and Roger Mac had sometimes speculated about what it might be like to meet someone like Washingtonâ€”though having met a number of famous people himself, heâ€™d told her that the experience was likely to prove a disappointment.

He would admit that Washington knew what he was about, though; he listened more than he talked, and when he said something, it was to the point. And he did give off an air of relaxed authority, though it was clear the present prospect excited him very much. His face was pockmarked, big-featured, and far from handsome, but had a good bit of dignity and presence.

His expression had become very animated, and he went so far as to laugh now and then, showing very bad, stained teeth. Jamie was fascinated; Brianna had told him they were false, made of wood or hippopotamus ivory, and he had a sudden dislocating recollection of his grandfather: the Old Fox had had a set of teeth made of beechwood. Jamie had thrown them on the fire during an argument at Beaufort Castleâ€”and just for an instant he was there, smelling peat smoke and roasting venison, every hair on his body a-prickle with warning, surrounded by kinsmen who might just kill him.

And as suddenly he was back, pressed between Lee and auld Dan, smelling sweat and exhilaration and, despite himself, feeling the rising excitement among them begin to seep into his blood.

It gave him a queer feeling in his wame, to sit nay more than a foot away from a man whom he knew not at all but about whom he maybe kent more than the man himself.

True, heâ€™d sat with Charles Stuart many evenings, knowingâ€”and believingâ€”what Claire had said would happen to him. But still . . . Christ had told doubting Thomas, â€œBlessed are those who have not seen but have believed.â€ Jamie wondered what you called those who had seen and were obliged to live with the resultant knowledge. He thought â€œblessedâ€ was maybe not the word.



IT WAS MORE than an hour before Washington and the others took their leaveâ€”an hour during which Jamie thought repeatedly that he might just stand up, flip the table over, and run out the door, leaving the Continental army to make shift without him.

He kent perfectly well that armies moved slowly, save when fighting. And clearly Washington expected that it would be a week or more before the British actually quit Philadelphia. But it was no use talking sense to his body, which as usual had its own measures of importance. He could ignore or suppress hunger, thirst, fatigue, and injury. He couldnâ€™t suppress the need to see Claire.

Likely it was what she and Brianna called testosterone poisoning, he thought idlyâ€”their term for the obvious things men did that women didnâ€™t understand. Someday he must ask her what testosterone was. He shifted uncomfortably on the narrow bench, forcing his mind back to what Washington was saying.

At long last, there came a rap on the door, and a black man put his head in and nodded to Washington.

â€œReady, suh,â€ he said, in the same soft Virginia accent as his master.

â€œThank you, Caesar.â€ Washington nodded back, then put his hands on the table and rose swiftly. â€œWe are agreed, then, gentlemen? Youâ€™re coming with me, General Lee. Iâ€™ll see the rest of you in due course at Sutfinâ€™s farm, save you hear otherwise.â€

Jamieâ€™s heart leapt and he made to rise, too, but auld Dan put a hand on his sleeve.

â€œSet a bit, Jamie,â€ he said. â€œYouâ€™ll need to know something about your new command, wonâ€™t you?â€

â€œIâ€”â€ he began, but there was no help for it. He sat and waited while Nathanael Greene thanked Mrs. Hardman for her hospitality and begged her to accept a small recompense from the army for her civil reception of them. Jamie would have wagered a good deal that the coins he plucked from his purse were his own and not the armyâ€™s, but the woman took them, an acceptance too faint to be pleasure showing in her worn face. He saw her shoulders sag with relief as the door closed behind the generals and realized that their presence might have put her and her child in considerable peril, should the wrong people see uniformed Continental officers visiting her house.

She glanced consideringly at him and Dan, but they seemed to trouble her much less, in their rough civilian clothes. Dan had taken off his uniform coat and folded it inside out, laying it on the bench beside him.

â€œFeel any tongues of fire come down on your head just now, Jamie?â€ Dan asked, seeing his look.

â€œWhat?â€

â€œThen the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you,â€ Dan quoted, and grinned wide at Jamieâ€™s look of astonishment.

â€œMy Abigailâ€™s a reading woman, and she reads bits oâ€™ the Bible out to me regular, in hopes itâ€™ll do some good, though ainâ€™t much luck in that direction yet.â€ He took up the rucksack heâ€™d brought in and dredged about in it, coming out with a folded sheaf of dog-eared papers, an inkhorn, and a couple of tattered quills.

â€œWell, now that the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost are gone off about their own business, let me write you down the names of your company commanders, what-all you got in the way of militia, and where they all are, â€™cuz it ainâ€™t like theyâ€™re all in barracksâ€”or even in the same village. Missus Hardman, might I trouble you, maâ€™am, for a drop of water for my ink?â€

Jamie bent his mind with difficulty to the business at hand, the better to dispatch it quickly, and within a quarter hour was gathering together the lists, made out in Danâ€™s slow, crabbed hand. Two hours to Philadelphia . . . maybe three . . .

â€œGot any money on you to speak of?â€ Dan asked, pausing by the door.

â€œNot a penny,â€ Jamie admitted, with a glance at the spot on his belt where his purse was normally fastened. Heâ€™d given it to Jenny to keep on the journey, as she delighted in making their small purchases. And this morning heâ€™d been so much on fire to see Claire that heâ€™d left the printshop with nothing but the clothes on his back and the packet of papers for Fergus. He spared an instant to wonder whether things would be different now, had he not been spotted giving the papers to Fergus and followed to Lord Johnâ€™s house by the soldiersâ€”and Williamâ€”but there was no point in regrets.

Dan pawed in his sack again, came out with a smaller bag and a clinking purse, both of which he tossed to Jamie.

â€œA bit of food for your journey, and an advance on your generalâ€™s pay,â€ he said, and chortled with amusement at his own wit. â€œYouâ€™ll need to pay hard cash for a uniform these days; ainâ€™t a tailor in Philadelphia will take Continentals. And woe betide you if you show up before his worshipfulness George Washington without being dressed proper. Heâ€™s a stickler for proper uniform, says you canâ€™t expect to command respect without lookinâ€™ like you deserve it. But I reckon you know all about that.â€

Dan, who had fought both battles of Saratoga in a hunting shirt, leaving his uniform coat hung over a tree branch in camp because of the heat, smiled broadly at Jamie, the scar on his upper lip where a bullet had torn through his face showing white against the weathered skin.

â€œFare thee well, General Fraser!â€

Jamie snorted but smiled nonetheless as he stood to shake Danâ€™s hand. Then he turned back to the litter on the table, stowing the papers and purseâ€”and a stray quill that Dan had abandoned, overlookedâ€”into the bag. He was grateful for the food; the scent of jerked meat and journeycake floated out of the canvas depths, and he could feel the hard shape of apples at the bottom. Heâ€™d left the printshop without breakfast, too.

He straightened, and a pain like white lightning shot from the middle of his spine down the back of his leg to the sole of his foot. He gasped and collapsed onto a stool, his lower back and right buttock clenched with cramp.

â€œJesus, Mary, and Brideâ€”not now,â€ he said between his teeth, and meant it somewhere between prayer and curse. Heâ€™d felt something small wrench or tear in his back when heâ€™d hit John Grey, but in the heat of the moment it hadnâ€™t seemed important. It hadnâ€™t troubled him much walkingâ€”heâ€™d barely noticed, with all there was on his mindâ€”but now that heâ€™d sat for a time and the muscles had chilled . . .

He tried rising, carefully, collapsed again. Bent sweating over the table with his fists clenched, he said a number of things in Gaelic that werenâ€™t at all prayerful.

â€œIs thee quite well, Friend?â€ The woman of the house leaned near, peering nearsightedly at him in concern.

â€œA . . . moment,â€ he managed, trying to do as Claire told him and breathe through the spasm.

â€œLike labor pains,â€ sheâ€™d told him, amused. He hadnâ€™t thought it was funny the first time and didnâ€™t now.

The pain eased. He extended his leg, then flexed it back under him, very gingerly. So far, so good. But when he once more tried to rise, his lower back was locked in a vise, and a pain that made him catch his breath stabbed down his buttock.

â€œHave ye . . . anything like . . . whisky? Rum?â€ If he could just get to his feet . . . But the woman was shaking her head.

â€œIâ€™m sorry, Friend. I have not even small beer. Not even milk for the children any longer,â€ she added with a certain bitterness. â€œThe army took my goats away.â€

She didnâ€™t say which army, but he supposed it didnâ€™t matter to her. He made a sound of apology, just in case it had been the Continentals or the militia, and subsided, breathing heavily. This had happened three times beforeâ€”just the same sudden flashing pain, the inability to move. Once, it had taken four days before he could hobble; the other two times, he had got to his feet within two days, and while it had twinged sporadically for weeks, heâ€™d been able to walk, if slowly.

â€œIs thee ill? I could give thee rhubarb syrup,â€ she offered. He managed to smile at that, shaking his head.

â€œI thank ye, maâ€™am. Itâ€™s no but a clench in my back. When it eases, all will be well.â€ The trouble was that until it eased, he was all but helpless, and the dawning realization of that gave him a sense of panic.

â€œOh.â€ The woman hesitated for a moment, hovering, but then the baby started to wail and she turned away to fetch it. A little girlâ€”five or six, he thought, a stunted little creatureâ€”crawled out from under the bed and stared at him curiously.

â€œIs thee going to stay to supper?â€ she asked, in a high, precise voice. She gave him an appraising frown. â€œThee looks like thee would eat a lot.â€

He revised his estimate of the girlâ€™s age to eight or nine and smiled at her. He was still sweating with the pain, but it was easing a bit.

â€œIâ€™ll not take your food, a nighean,â€ he assured her. â€œIn fact, thereâ€™s a good loaf and some jerked meat in yon bag; itâ€™s yours.â€ Her eyes went round as pennies, and he amended, â€œYour familyâ€™s, I mean.â€

She glanced eagerly at the bag, swallowing painfully as her mouth watered; he could hear the tiny gulp and it wrung his heart.

â€œPru!â€ she whispered, turning urgently toward the table. â€œFood!â€

Another small girl crawled out and stood beside her sister. They were both plain as fence posts, though they otherwise didnâ€™t resemble each other much.

â€œI heard,â€ the newcomer told her sister, and turned a solemn gaze on Jamie.

â€œDonâ€™t let Mam give thee rhubarb syrup,â€ she advised him. â€œIt makes thee shit like the blazes, and if thee canâ€™t get to the privy, itâ€”â€

â€œPrudence!â€

Prudence obligingly shut her mouth, though she continued to look Jamie over with interest. Her sister knelt and rummaged under the bed, emerging with the family utensil, this a homely object of brown earthenware, which she presented gravely for his inspection.

â€œWeâ€™ll turn our backs, sir, if thee should need toâ€”â€

â€œPatience!â€

Red in the face, Mrs. Hardman took the piss pot from her daughter and shooed the little girls to the table, whereâ€”with a glance at Jamie to be sure he had meant itâ€”she took the bread and meat and apples from his bag, dividing the food scrupulously into three parts: two large portions for the girls, and a smaller one for herself, put aside for later.

She had left the chamber pot on the floor beside the bed, and as she eased him gingerly onto the corn-shuck mattress, Jamie caught sight of lettering painted in white across the bottom. He squinted to make it out in the dim light, then smiled. It was a Latin motto, encircling a vividly executed bee with a jovial expression and a pronounced wink. Iam apis potanda fineo ne.

Heâ€™d seen the jest beforeâ€”the brothel in Edinburgh where heâ€™d once kept a room had been equipped throughout with utensils sporting a variety of Latin tags, most of them prurient, but some merely puns, like this one. It was a Latin sentence, if a foolish oneâ€”

â€œDrink not the bee nowâ€â€”but if read phonetically in English, ignoring the spacing, it read, â€œI am a piss pot and a fine one.â€ He glanced up at Mrs. Hardman in speculation but thought it was likely not her work. The absent Mr. Hardman must beâ€”or have been, he thought, given the obvious poverty of the household, and he crossed himself unobtrusively at the thoughtâ€”an educated man.

The baby had waked and was fussing in her cradle, making small sharp yelps like a fox kit. Mrs. Hardman scooped the child out, pulling a worn nursing chair toward the fire with one foot. She laid the baby momentarily on the bed beside Jamie, opening her blouse with one hand, the other reaching automatically to save an apple that was rolling toward the edge of the table, nudged by a little girlâ€™s elbow.

The baby smacked her lips, hungry as her sisters. â€œAnd this will be wee Chastity, I make nay doubt?â€ he said.

Mrs. Hardman gaped at him. â€œHow did thee know the childâ€™s name?â€

He glanced at Prudence and Patience, who were silently stuffing bread and meat into their mouths as quickly as they could eat. â€œWell, I havena yet met a lassie named Sobriety or Fortitude,â€ he said mildly. â€œThe weanâ€™s sopping; have ye a clean clootie for her?â€

There were two worn clouts hung to dry before the fire; she brought one, to find that Jamie had already unpinned the babyâ€™s soggy nappieâ€”thatâ€™s what Claire called themâ€”and wiped the shit from her bottom, holding her tiny ankles in one hand.

â€œThee has children, I see.â€ Eyebrows raised, Mrs. Hardman took the soiled clout from him with a nod of thanks and dropped it into a bucket of vinegar and water that stood in the far corner.

â€œAnd grandchildren,â€ he said, wiggling a finger in front of wee Chastityâ€™s nose. She gurgled and went cross-eyed, kicking her legs enthusiastically. â€œTo say nothing of six nephews and nieces.â€ And where are Jem and wee Mandy, I wonder? Can she breathe easy now, poor lassie? He gently tickled the babyâ€™s soft pink foot, remembering the strangely beautiful, heart-wrenching blue tinge to Mandyâ€™s perfect toes, long-jointed and graceful as a frogâ€™s.

â€œTheyâ€™re just like yours,â€ Claire had told him, drawing a fingernail lightly down the sole of Mandyâ€™s foot, making the long big toe spring suddenly away from the others. What had she called that?

He tried it himself, gingerly, and smiled with delight to see it happen to Chastityâ€™s chubby toes.

â€œBabinski,â€ he said to Mrs. Hardman, with a sense of deep satisfaction at recalling the name. â€œThatâ€™s what itâ€™s called when a weanâ€™s great toe does that. A Babinski reflex.â€

Mrs. Hardman looked astonishedâ€”though much more so when he skillfully repinned the new clout and swaddled wee Chastity afresh in her blanket. She took the baby from him and, with an uncertain expression, sank down in the chair and pulled the ratty shawl over the babyâ€™s head. Unable to turn over easily, Jamie instead closed his eyes to afford her such privacy as he could.





REMEMBER PAOLI!

IT WAS HARD TO wipe away the sweat with his hands tied and impossible to keep the stinging salt out of his wounded eye, so puffed and slitted that he couldnâ€™t close it tightly. Water ran down his cheek in a steady flow, dripping off his chin. Blinking in a vain attempt to clear his vision, John Grey missed a fallen branch in his path and fell heavily.

Those behind him on the narrow trail halted abruptly, with sounds of mild collision, jangling weapons and canteens, confusion and impatience. Rough hands seized him and hauled him up again, but the tall, rawboned man deputed to be his escort said only, â€œWatch your step, me lord,â€ in a mild tone of voice, and gave him a nudge down the path rather than a shove.

Encouraged by this evidence of consideration, he thanked the man and asked his name.

â€œMe?â€ The man sounded surprised. â€œOh. Bumppo. Natty Bumppo.â€ Adding, after a moment, â€œFolks mostly call me â€˜Hawkeye,â€™ though.â€

â€œI donâ€™t wonder,â€ Grey said, half under his breath. He bowed, as well as he could whilst walking, and nodded at the long rifle that bobbed in a sling at the manâ€™s back. â€œYour servant, sir. I deduce that you are a fine shot, then?â€

â€œReckon that would be a good deduction, your lordship.â€ Bumppoâ€™s voice sounded amused. â€œWhy? Dâ€™you want something shot? Or somebody?â€

â€œIâ€™m keeping a list,â€ Grey told him. â€œIâ€™ll let you know when itâ€™s complete.â€

He felt, rather than heard, the otherâ€™s laughâ€”the amusement was palpable, but it made little sound.

â€œLet me guess whoâ€™s first on your listâ€”the big Scotch fellow what put your light out?â€

â€œHeâ€™d be fairly high on the list, yes.â€ Actually, he couldnâ€™t decide who heâ€™d rather see shot first: Jamie Fraser or his own bloody brother. Probably Hal, all things considered. Rather ironic, if Hal ended up getting him shot. Though his captors seemed quite convinced that hanging was the preferred method.

That reminded him of the uncomfortable bit of conversation that had preceded his being chivvied through the woods on a deer trail bountifully equipped with bramblish bushes, low-hanging branches, ticks, and biting flies the size of the ball of his thumb.

â€œWould you happen to know whatâ€”or possibly whoâ€”Paoli is, Mr. Bumppo?â€ he asked politely, kicking a fir cone out of his way.

â€œWhatâ€™s Paoli?â€ The manâ€™s voice was filled with astonishment. â€œWhy, man, are you just come to this neck oâ€™ the woods?â€

â€œFairly recently,â€ Grey replied guardedly.

â€œOh.â€ Bumppo considered, carefully matching his lengthy stride to Greyâ€™s shorter one. â€œWhy, â€™twas an infamous attack, to be sure. Your kinsmanâ€”Major General Grey, as they saidâ€”him and his troops snuck up by night to where General Wayneâ€™s men were camped. Grey didnâ€™t want to risk a stray flint sparking and giving them away, so he gives the order to take out all the flints from their guns and use the bayonets. Fell upon the Americans and bayoneted near a hundred men in their beds, in cold blood!â€

â€œReally?â€ Grey tried to reconcile this account with any recent battle he knew of, and failed. â€œAnd . . . Paoli?â€

â€œOh. Thatâ€™s the name of the tavern nearbyâ€”Paoliâ€™s Tavern.â€

â€œAh. Where is it? Geographically, I mean. And when, exactly, did this battle occur?â€

Bumppoâ€™s prehensile lips pushed out in thought, then withdrew.

â€œBe up near Malvern, last September. The Paoli Massacre, they calls it,â€ he added with a certain dubiousness.



â€œMassacre?â€ Grey echoed. The engagement had taken place before his own arrival, but heâ€™d heard it talked aboutâ€”briefly, and not in terms of massacre, to be sure. But, then, perceptions of the event were bound to be different, depending upon oneâ€™s position in the matter. William Howe had spoken of it with approvalâ€”as a successful engagement in which a minimal number of British troops had routed an entire American division, with a loss of only seven men.

Bumppo seemed disposed to share Greyâ€™s opinion of the rhetorical nature of the name, albeit from yet a third perspective.

â€œWell, you know how folks will talk,â€ he said, lifting one shoulder. â€œAinâ€™t what Iâ€™d call a proper massacre, but, then, ainâ€™t many folk seen one, and I have.â€

â€œYou have?â€ Glancing up at the tall, bearded ruffian, Grey thought it only too likely.

â€œWas raised as an Indian,â€ Bumppo said, with visible pride. â€œBy the Mohican, my own folks havinâ€™ died when I were just a tadpole. Aye, Iâ€™ve seen a massacre or two.â€

â€œIndeed?â€ Grey said, innate courtesy obliging him to invite the man to elaborate, should he wish to. Besides, it would pass the time; they seemed to have been walking for hours, and no end in sightâ€”not that he was eagerly anticipating the end. . . .

As it was, Mr. Bumppoâ€™s reminiscences passed the time to such good effect that Grey was surprised when Corporal Woodbine, in the lead, called the company to a halt at the edge of a fairly sizable encampment. He was glad enough to stop, though; he was wearing city shoes, not suited for the terrain at all, and they had worn through his stockings and rubbed his feet to blood and blisters.

â€œScout Bumppo,â€ Woodbine said, with a short nod to Greyâ€™s companion. â€œYouâ€™ll take the company on to Zeke Bowenâ€™s place. Iâ€™ll deliver the prisoner to Colonel Smith.â€

This statement gave rise to vocal discontent, from which Grey gathered that the company wished very much to accompany Woodbine, in order not to miss Greyâ€™s execution, which they confidently expected to occur within moments of his delivery to the aforesaid Colonel Smith. Woodbine was firm about it, though, and with democratic mutterings and execrations, the militia moved reluctantly off under the guidance of Natty Bumppo.

Woodbine watched them out of sight, then drew himself up, brushing a stray caterpillar from the breast of his shabby coat and straightening his disreputable hat.

â€œWell, Lieutenant Colonel Grey. Shall we go?â€



NATTY BUMPPOâ€™S reminiscences of the proper way to conduct a massacre had left Grey with the feeling that perhaps, by contrast, hanging was not the worst way to die. But while he hadnâ€™t personally witnessed any first-rate massacres, heâ€™d seen men hanged, very close toâ€”and the memory of it dried his throat. The leakage from his eye hadnâ€™t stopped completely but had lessened; the skin felt raw and inflamed, though, and the swelling gave him the annoying sense that his head was grossly misshapen. Still, he drew himself upright and strode chin out into the ragged canvas tent ahead of Corporal Woodbine.

Colonel Smith looked up from his lap desk, startled at the intrusionâ€”though not quite as startled as Grey.

Heâ€™d last seen Watson Smith in his own sister-in-lawâ€™s drawing room in London two years ago, eating cucumber sandwiches. In the uniform of a captain of the Buffs.

â€œMr. Smith,â€ he said, recovering his wits first. He bowed very correctly. â€œYour servant, sir.â€ He didnâ€™t bother trying to keep the edge out of his voice or his expression. He sat down upon a vacant stool without being invited and gave Smith as direct a stare as he could with one operant eye.

Smithâ€™s cheeks flushed, but he leaned back a little, gathering his own wits before replying, and returned Greyâ€™s stare, with interest. He was not a big man but had broad shoulders and considerable presence of mannerâ€”and Grey knew him to be a very competent soldier. Competent enough not to reply directly to Grey but to turn instead to Corporal Woodbine.

â€œCorporal. How comes this gentleman here?â€

â€œThis is Lieutenant Colonel Lord John Grey, sir,â€ Woodbine said. He was near bursting with pride at his capture and placed Greyâ€™s Kingâ€™s warrant and Gravesâ€™s accompanying note on the rickety table with the manner of a butler presenting a roast pheasant with diamond eyes to a reigning monarch. â€œWe caught him in the woods near Philadelphia. Out of uniform. Er . . . as you see, sir.â€ He cleared his throat in emphasis. â€œAnd he admits to being a cousin of Major General Charles Grey. You knowâ€”the Paoli Massacre.â€

â€œReally?â€ Smith picked up the papers but cocked an eyebrow at Grey. â€œWhat was he doing there?â€

â€œHaving the shit beaten out of him by Colonel Fraser, sirâ€”heâ€™s one of Morganâ€™s officers. He said,â€ Woodbine added, with less certainty.

Smith looked blank.

â€œFraser . . . donâ€™t believe I know him.â€ Switching his attention to Grey, he addressed him for the first time. â€œDo you know Colonel Fraser . . . Colonel Grey?â€

The elaborate hesitation spoke volumes. Well, he hadnâ€™t expected anything else. Grey wiped his nose as well as he could on a forearm and sat straight.

â€œI decline to answer your questions, sir. They are improperly put. You know my name, rank, and regiment. Beyond that, my business is my own.â€

Smith stared at him, eyes narrowed. Smithâ€™s eyes were rather attractive, a pale gray with black brows and lashes, very dramatic. Grey had noticed them when the man came to tea with Minnie.

Woodbine coughed.

â€œEr . . . Colonel Fraser said the man was his prisoner, sir. But he wouldnâ€™t say what for, and when I pressed the matter, he . . . er . . . left. Thatâ€™s when we searched Lord . . . er, the lord colonel here, and found his papers.â€

â€œHe left,â€ Smith repeated carefully. â€œAnd you allowed him to leave, Corporal?â€



Woodbine was looking less confident in the virtue of his conduct but wasnâ€™t the sort to be easily cowed, Grey saw. He lowered his brow and gave Smith a look of his own.

â€œCouldnâ€™t have stopped him, short of shooting him. Sir,â€ he added flatly. The flesh around Smithâ€™s nostrils whitened, and Grey had the distinct impression that the Englishman must find his new command not quite what heâ€™d been used to.

The quarters certainly werenâ€™t. While Smithâ€™s Continental uniform was smart and well tended, and his wig in good order, his tent, while large, appeared to have been through several campaigns, being worn to the threads in places and patched in others. Not entirely a bad thing, Grey thought, briefly closing his eyes as a faint evening breeze came wafting through the walls of the tent, relieving the stifling heat. He had a noticeable headache, and even such minor relief was welcome.

â€œVery well, Corporal,â€ Smith said after a moment, having evidently tried and failed to think of something new to ask. â€œWell done,â€ he added, offering a belated note of congratulation.

â€œThank you, sir.â€ Woodbine hovered, obviously loath to surrender his share of the excitement. â€œIf I may ask, sirâ€”what do you mean to do with the prisoner?â€

Grey opened his eye and a half, interested to hear what the answer might be, and found Smith eyeing him in what seemed a faintly carnivorous fashion. The turncoat smiled.

â€œOh, Iâ€™ll think of something, Corporal Woodbine,â€ he said. â€œYou are dismissed. Good night.â€



SMITH GOT UP and came over to Grey, leaning down to examine his face. Grey could smell his sweat, sharp and musky.

â€œDo you need a doctor?â€ he asked dispassionately, but without hostility.

â€œNo,â€ Grey said. Both his head and his side ached deeply, and he felt dizzy, but he doubted there was anything a doctor could do about either condition. And he found that after prolonged contact with Claire and her opinions, he had much less trust in physicians than heretoforeâ€”and he hadnâ€™t had much to begin with.

Smith nodded and, straightening up, went to a battered campaign chest and dug out two dented pewter cups and a stone bottle of what proved to be applejack. He poured two generous tots, and they sat in silence for a time, sipping.

So close to Midsummer Day, it was still bright light out, though Grey could hear the rattle and shuffle of a camp beginning the evening routine. A mule brayed loudly, and several more answered it in raucous chorus. Wagons, then . . . perhaps artillery? He breathed deeply, nostrils flaring; an artillery company had a distinct smell to it, a sort of distillation of sweat, black powder, and hot metal, much more pungent than the scent of an infantry company with their musketsâ€”the scent of searing iron seeped into an artillerymanâ€™s clothes, as well as his soul.



What came to him was not the stink of guns but the smell of roasting meat. It drifted through the tent, and his stomach growled loudly; heâ€™d eaten nothing since the beer that had been his preliminary to a preempted meal. He thought Smithâ€™s mouth twitched a little at the noise, but the colonel politely ignored it.

Smith finished his drink, refilled both cups, and cleared his throat.

â€œI will not plague you with questions, as you donâ€™t wish to answer them,â€ he said carefully, â€œbut in the interests of civil conversation, should you wish to make any inquiries of me, I should not take offense.â€

Grey smiled wryly.

â€œVery gracious of you, sir. Do you wish to justify your present allegiance to me? I assure you, itâ€™s unnecessary.â€

Small red patches sprang up immediately on Smithâ€™s cheekbones.

â€œThat was not my intent, sir,â€ he said stiffly.

â€œThen I apologize,â€ Grey said, and took another mouthful. The sweet strong cider was assuaging his hunger pangs as well as the pain in his side, though it admittedly wasnâ€™t doing much for the dizziness. â€œWhat sort of question did you think I might ask? What is the current state of the Continental army? I could deduce that easily enough, I think, from the state of the gentlemen who captured me, and . . . other evidence.â€ He let his eyes roam deliberately around the tent, taking in the chipped pottery utensil under the lopsided cot, the tail of dirty linen straggling out of a portmanteau in the corner; evidently Smith had either no orderly or an inept one. For an instant, Grey felt a pang of nostalgia for Tom Byrd, the best valet he had ever had.

Smithâ€™s flush had faded; he gave a small, ironic laugh. â€œI imagine you could. Itâ€™s not much of a secret. No, I rather thought you might be curious as to what I propose to do with you.â€

â€œOh, that.â€ Grey put down his cup and rubbed gingerly at his forehead, trying not to touch the swollen area around his eye. â€œFrankly, Iâ€™d forgotten, in the surprise of seeing you. And the pleasure of your kind hospitality,â€ he added, lifting the cup with no irony at all. â€œCorporal Woodbine and his men appeared to think I should be promptly hanged, both on the charge of spying and on the more serious one of being related to Major General Charles Grey, who I gather is believed to have committed some atrocity at a place called Paoli.â€

Smithâ€™s brow creased.

â€œDo you deny being a spy?â€

â€œDonâ€™t be ridiculous, Smith. Iâ€™m a lieutenant colonel. What on earth would I be doing, spying in a deserted wood? Well, deserted until Woodbine and his merry men showed up,â€ he added. His cup was empty; he stared into it, wondering how that had happened. With a small sigh, Smith refilled it.

â€œBesides, I was carrying no documents of information, no secret writingsâ€”no evidence whatever of spying.â€

â€œDoubtless you committed to memory whatever information you had gained,â€ Smith said, sounding cynically amused. â€œI recall that you have a prodigious memory.â€ He gave a small snort that could perhaps have been called a snigger. â€œSo sayeth Sally, nimble-fingered, as her grip upon his prick did linger . . .â€



In fact, Greyâ€™s memory was quite good. Good enough to remember a dinner at which a number of officers from different regiments had been guests. When the gentlemen were at their port, Grey hadâ€”upon invitation, and to thunderous applauseâ€”recited entirely from memory one of the longer, and very scabrous, odes from Harry Quarryâ€™s infamous Certain Verses Upon the Subject of Eros, copies of which were still eagerly sought and covertly passed around the circles of society, though the book had been published nearly twenty years before.

â€œWhat on earth is there to spy on?â€ he demanded, realizing the logical trap too late. Smithâ€™s mouth turned up at one corner.

â€œYou expect me to tell you?â€ Because the answer, of course, was that Washingtonâ€™s entire force was likely on the move in his immediate vicinity, positioning for the move into Philadelphiaâ€”and, very possibly, for an attack on Clintonâ€™s withdrawing troops.

Grey dismissed Smithâ€™s question as rhetorical and took another tackâ€”though a dangerous one.

â€œWoodbine gave you a correct assessment of the circumstances in which he discovered me,â€ he said. â€œPlainly I was not discovered in flagrante by Colonel Fraser, as he would simply have done what Corporal Woodbine did and arrested me.â€

â€œAre you asserting that Colonel Fraser met you by arrangement, to pass on information?â€

Jesus Christ. Heâ€™d known this tack was dangerous but hadnâ€™t foreseen that possibilityâ€”that Jamie Fraser could be suspected of being his confederate. But of course Smith would be particularly sensitive to such a possibility, given his own change of loyalties.

â€œCertainly not,â€ Grey said, allowing a certain asperity to creep into his tone. â€œThe encounter that Corporal Woodbine witnessed was of a purely personal nature.â€

Smith, who plainly knew a thing or two about interrogation, cocked a brow at him. Grey knew a thing or two about it, too, and sat back, sipping his applejack insouciantly, as though quite sure his statement had settled matters.

â€œThey will probably hang you, you know,â€ Smith said after a suitable pause. He spoke quite casually, eyes on the amber stream as he refilled both cups again. â€œAfter what Howe did to Captain Hale? Even more, after Paoli. Charles Grey is your cousin, is he not?â€

â€œSecond or third cousin, yes.â€ Grey knew the man, though they didnâ€™t move in the same circles, either socially or militarily. Charles Grey was a pig-faced professional killer, rather than a soldier, and while he doubted that the Paoli Massacre had been entirely as describedâ€”what sort of idiots would lie on the ground waiting to be bayoneted in their beds? Because he didnâ€™t for an instant think a column of infantry was capable of sneaking up in the dark over rough country to within stabbing distance without giving some notice of their presenceâ€”he did know about Charlesâ€™s merciless bayonet tactics at Culloden.

â€œNonsense,â€ Grey said, with as much confidence as he could summon. â€œWhatever one may think of the American high command, I doubt it is composed entirely of fools. My execution would yield nothing, whereas my exchange might be of value. My brother does have some small influence.â€

Smith smiled, not without sympathy.

â€œAn excellent argument, Lord John, and one Iâ€™m sure would find favor with General Washington. Unfortunately, the Congress and the King remain at loggerheads over the matter of exchange; at present, there is no mechanism to allow the exchange of prisoners.â€

That one struck him in the pit of the stomach. He knew all too well that there were no official channels of exchange; heâ€™d been trying to have William exchanged for months.

Smith upended the bottle, dribbling the last amber drops into Greyâ€™s cup.

â€œAre you a Bible-reading man, Colonel Grey?â€

Grey looked at him blankly.

â€œNot habitually. I have read it, though. Some of it. Well . . . bits. Why?â€

â€œI wondered if you were familiar with the concept of a scapegoat.â€ Smith rocked back a little on his stool, gazing at Grey with his lovely deep-set eyes, which seemed to hold a certain sympathyâ€”though perhaps it was just the applejack. â€œBecause Iâ€™m afraid that is where your chief value lies, Colonel. It is no secret that the Continental army is in poor condition, lacking money, disillusion and desertion rife. Nothing would hearten and unify the troops moreâ€”or send a more potent message to General Clintonâ€”than the trial and very public execution of a high-ranking British officer, a convicted spy and close relation to the infamous â€˜No Flintsâ€™ Grey.â€

He belched softly and blinked, eyes still fixed on Grey.

â€œYou asked what I meant to do with you.â€

â€œNo, I didnâ€™t.â€

Smith ignored this, leveling a long, knobby finger at him.

â€œIâ€™m sending you to General Wayne, who, believe me, has â€˜Paoliâ€™ carved upon his heart.â€

â€œHow very painful for him,â€ Grey said politely, and drained his cup.





EINE KLEINE NACHTMUSIK

THE INTERMINABLE DAY was reluctantly ending, the heat at last beginning to fade from the forest along with the waning light. He didnâ€™t suppose that he would be taken directly to General Wayne, unless that worthy were close at hand, and he thought not. He could tell from the sounds and the feel of the camp that it was a small one, and plainly Colonel Smith was the senior officer present.

Smith had asked him, pro forma, to give his paroleâ€”and been substantially taken aback when Grey had courteously refused to do so.

â€œIf I am in fact a duly commissioned British officer,â€ Grey had pointed out, â€œthen clearly it is my duty to escape.â€

Smith eyed him, the failing light shading his face with sufficient ambiguity that Grey was not sure whether he was fighting an impulse to smile or not. Probably not.

â€œYouâ€™re not escaping,â€ he said definitely, and went out. Grey could hear a brief, heated discussion, conducted in low voices outside the tent, as to just what to do with him. A militia camp on the move had no facilities for prisoners. Grey amused himself by composing a mental entertainment in which Smith was obliged to share his narrow cot with Grey, in the interests of keeping his prisoner secure.

In the end, though, a corporal came in, carrying a rusty set of fetters that looked as though they had last seen use during the Spanish Inquisition, and took Grey to the edge of camp, where a soldier who had been a blacksmith in private life banged them into place with a stout hammer, using a flattish rock as an anvil.

He felt the oddest sensations, kneeling on the ground in the twilight, an interested group of militiamen gathered round in a circle to watch. He was forced to lean forward in a crouching posture, hands laid before him, as though he were about to be beheaded, and the hammer blows echoed through the metal, into the bones of his wrists and arms.

He kept his eyes on the hammer, and not only from fear that the smith would miss his aim in the growing dusk and smash one of his hands. Under the influence of intoxication and a growing, deeper fear that he didnâ€™t want to acknowledge, he sensed the mingled curiosity and animus surrounding him and felt it as he would a nearby thunderstorm, electricity crawling over his skin, the threat of lightning annihilation so close he could smell its sharp odor, mixed with gunpowder and the heavy tang of the sweat of men.

Ozone. His mind seized on the word, a small escape into rationality. Thatâ€™s what Claire called the smell of lightning. Heâ€™d told her he thought it was from the Greek ozon, the neuter present participle of ozein, meaning â€œto smell.â€

He began to work his way methodically through the complete conjugation; by the time heâ€™d finished, surely they would be done with it. Ozein, to smell. I smell . . .

He could smell his own sweat, sharp and sweet. In the old days, it was considered a better death, beheading. To be hanged was shameful, a commonerâ€™s death, a criminalâ€™s death. Slower. He knew that for a fact.

A final reverberating blow, and a visceral sound of satisfaction from the watching men. He was made prisoner.



THERE BEING NO shelter other than the brushy wigwams and scraps of canvas the militiamen rigged near their fires, he was escorted back to Smithâ€™s big, threadbare tent, given supperâ€”which he forced down, not much noticing what he ateâ€”and then tethered to the tent pole with a long, thin rope run through the chain of his irons, with sufficient play as to allow him to lie down or use the utensil.

At Smithâ€™s insistence, he took the cot and did lie down with a slight groan of relief. His temples throbbed with each heartbeat, and so did the entire left side of his face, which was now radiating small jolts down into his upper teeth, very unpleasant. The pain in his side had dulled to a deep ache, almost negligible by comparison. Luckily, he was so tired that sleep swamped all discomfort, and he fell into it with a sense of profound gratitude.

He woke in the full dark sometime later, slicked with sweat, heart hammering from some desperate dream. He raised a hand to push the soaked hair off his face and felt the heavy, chafing weight of the fetters, which heâ€™d forgotten about. They clanked, and the dark figure of a sentry silhouetted in the fire glow at the entrance of the tent turned sharply toward him, but then relaxed as he turned over on the cot, clanking further.

Bugger, he thought, still groggy with sleep. Couldnâ€™t even masturbate if I wanted to. The thought made him laugh, though fortunately it came out as a mere breath of sound.

Another body turned over, rustling, shifting heavily near him. Smith, he supposed, sleeping on a canvas bed sack stuffed with grass; Grey could smell the meadow scent of dry hay, faintly musty in the humid air. The bed sack was standard issue to the British army; Smith must have kept it, along with his tent and other equipment, changing only his uniform.

Why had he turned his coat? Grey wondered vaguely, peering at Smithâ€™s humped shape, just visible against the pale canvas. Advancement? Starved as they were for professional soldiers, the Continentals offered rank as inducement; a captain in any European army might become anything from a major to a general in the blink of an eye, whereas the only means of achieving higher rank in England was to find the money to purchase it.

What was rank without pay, though? Grey was no longer a spy, but he had been one, onceâ€”and still knew men who labored in those dark fields. From what heâ€™d heard, the American Congress had no money at all and depended upon loansâ€”these unpredictable in amount and erratic in occurrence. Some from French or Spanish sources, though the French wouldnâ€™t admit to it, of course. Some from Jewish moneylenders, said one of his correspondents. Salomon, Solomon . . . some name like that.

These random musings were interrupted by a sound that made him stiffen. A womanâ€™s laughter.

There were women in the camp, wives who had come along to war with their husbands. Heâ€™d seen a few when they took him across the campground, and one had brought his supper, glancing suspiciously up at him from under her cap. But he thought he knew that laughâ€”deep, gurgling, and totally unself-conscious.

â€œJesus,â€ he whispered under his breath. â€œDottie?â€

It wasnâ€™t impossible. He swallowed, trying to clear his left ear, to listen through the multitude of small sounds outside. Denzell Hunter was a Continental surgeon, and Dottie hadâ€”to her brotherâ€™s, cousinâ€™s, and uncleâ€™s horrorâ€”joined the camp followers at Valley Forge in order to help her fiancÃ©, though she rode into Philadelphia regularly to visit her brother Henry. If Washingtonâ€™s forces were movingâ€”and very plainly they wereâ€”it was entirely possible that a surgeon might be anywhere among them.

A high, clear voice, raised in question. An English voice, and not common. He strained to hear but couldnâ€™t make out the words. He wished sheâ€™d laugh again.

If it was Dottie . . . he breathed deep, trying to think. He couldnâ€™t call out to her; heâ€™d felt the avid hostility directed at him from every man in campâ€”letting the relationship be known would be dangerous for her and Denzell, both, and certainly wouldnâ€™t help Grey. And yet he had to risk itâ€”theyâ€™d move him in the morning.

Out of sheer inability to think of anything better, he sat up on the cot and began to sing â€œDie Sommernacht.â€ Quietly at first, but gathering strength and volume. As he hit â€œIn den Kulungen wehnâ€ at the top of his very resonant tenor voice, Smith sat up like a jack-in-the-box and said, â€œWhat?â€ in tones of utter amazement.

â€œSo umschatten mich Gedanken an das Grab



Meiner Geliebten, und ich sehâ€™ im Walde



Nur es dÃ¤mmern, und es weht mir



Von der BlÃ¼te nicht her.â€



Grey went on, reducing his volume somewhat. He didnâ€™t want Dottieâ€”if it was Dottieâ€”coming to look, only to let her know he was here. Heâ€™d taught her this lied when she was fourteen; she sang it often at musicales.

â€œIch genoÃŸ einst, o ihr Toten, es mit euch!



Wie umwehten uns der Duft und die KÃ¼hlung,



Wie verschÃ¶nt warst von dem Monde,



Du, o schÃ¶ne Natur!â€



He stopped, coughed a little, and spoke into the marked silence before him, slurring his words a bit, as though still drunk. In fact, he discovered, he was.

â€œMight I have some water, Colonel?â€

â€œWill you sing anymore if I give it to you?â€ Smith asked, deeply suspicious.

â€œNo, I think Iâ€™m finished now,â€ Grey assured him. â€œCouldnâ€™ sleep, you knowâ€”too much to drinkâ€”but I find a song settles the mind rem-remarkably.â€

â€œOh, does it?â€ Smith breathed heavily for a moment, but clambered to his feet and fetched the ewer from his basin. Grey could feel him repressing an urge to douse his prisoner with the contents, but Smith was a man of strong character and merely held the pitcher for him to drink, then put it back and resumed his own bed with no more than a few irritable snorts.

The lied had caused some comment in the camp, and a few musical souls took it as inspiration and began singing everything from â€œGreensleevesâ€â€”a very poignant and tender renditionâ€”to â€œChester.â€ Grey quite enjoyed the singing, though it was only by exercise of his own strong character that he refrained from shaking his fetters at the end of:

â€œLet tyrants shake their iron rods. And slavery clank her galling chains.â€

They were still singing when he fell asleep again, to dream in anxious fragments, the fumes of applejack drifting through the hollow spaces of his head.

Number 17 Chestnut Street

THE BELL OF the Presbyterian church struck midnight, but the city wasnâ€™t sleeping. The sounds were more furtive now, muffled by darkness, but the streets were still alive with hurrying feet and the sound of moving wagonsâ€”and, in the far distance, I heard a faint cry of â€œFire!â€ being raised.

I stood by the open window, sniffing the air for smoke and watching out for any sign of flames that might spread in our direction. I wasnâ€™t aware of Philadelphia having ever burned to the ground like London or Chicago, but a fire that merely engulfed the neighborhood would be just as bad from my point of view.

There was no wind at all; that was something. The summer air hung heavy, damp as a sponge. I waited for a bit, but the cries stopped, and I saw no red glimmer of flames against the half-clouded sky. No trace of fire save the cool green sparks of fireflies, drifting among the shadowed leaves in the front garden.

I stood for a bit, letting my shoulders slump, letting go of my half-formed plans for emergency evacuation. I was exhausted but unable to sleep. Beyond the need to keep an eye on my unsettled patient, and the unsettled atmosphere beyond the quiet room, I was most unsettled in myself. Iâ€™d been listening all day, constantly on the alert for a familiar footstep, the sound of Jamieâ€™s voice. But he hadnâ€™t come.

What if he had learned from John that I had shared his bed on that one drunken evening? Would the shock of that, given without preparation or suitable explanation, be enough to have made him run awayâ€”for good?

I felt sudden tears come to my eyes and shut them, hard, to stem the flow, gripping the sill with both hands.

Donâ€™t be ridiculous. Heâ€™ll come as soon as he can, no matter what. You know he will. I did know. But the shocked joy of seeing him alive had wakened nerves that had been numb for a long time, and while I might seem calm externally, on the inside my emotions were at a rolling boil. The steam was building up, and I had no way to release the pressureâ€”save pointless tears, and I wouldnâ€™t give way to those.

For one thing, I might not be able to stop. I pressed the sleeve of my dressing gown briefly to my eyes, then turned back resolutely into the darkness of the room.

A small brazier burned near the bed under a tented wet cloth, casting a flickering red glow on Pardloeâ€™s sharp-cut features. He was breathing with an audible rasp and I could hear his lungs rattle with each exhalation, but it was a deep breathing, and regular. It occurred to me that I might not have been able to smell the smoke of a fire outside, had there been one: the atmosphere in the room was thick with oil of peppermint, eucalyptus . . . and cannabis. Despite the wet cloth, enough smoke had escaped the brazier to form a hanging cloud of purling wisps, moving pale as ghosts in the darkened air.

I sprinkled more water on the muslin tent and sat down in the small armchair beside the bed, breathing the saturated atmosphere in cautiously but with an agreeable small sense of illicit pleasure. Hal had told me that he was in the habit of smoking hemp to relax his lungs and that it seemed to be effective. Heâ€™d said â€œhemp,â€ and that was undoubtedly what heâ€™d been smoking; the psychoactive form of the plant didnâ€™t grow in England and wasnâ€™t commonly imported.

I hadnâ€™t any hemp leaves in my medical supply but did have a good bit of ganja, which John had acquired from a Philadelphia merchant who had two Indiamen. It was useful in the treatment of glaucoma, as Iâ€™d learned when treating Jamieâ€™s aunt Jocasta, it relieved nausea and anxietyâ€”and it had occasional non-medicinal uses, as John had informed me, to my private amusement.

Thought of John gave me a small internal qualm, to add to my anxiety over Jamie, and I took a deep, deliberate breath of the sweet, spicy air. Where was he? What had Jamie done with him?

â€œDo you ever make bargains with God?â€ Halâ€™s voice came quietly out of the half dark.

I must subconsciously have known he wasnâ€™t sleeping, for I wasnâ€™t startled.

â€œEveryone does,â€ I said. â€œEven people who donâ€™t believe in God. Do you?â€

There was the breath of a laugh, followed by coughing, but it stopped quickly. Perhaps the smoke was helping.

â€œHave you got such a bargain in mind?â€ I asked, as much from real curiosity as to make conversation. â€œYou arenâ€™t going to die, you know. I wonâ€™t let you.â€

â€œYes, you said that,â€ he replied dryly. After a momentâ€™s hesitation, he turned on his side to face me. â€œI do believe you,â€ he said rather formally. â€œAnd . . . I thank you.â€

â€œYouâ€™re quite welcome. I canâ€™t let you die in Johnâ€™s house, you know; heâ€™d be upset.â€

He smiled at that, his face visible in the brazierâ€™s glow. We didnâ€™t speak for a bit but sat looking at each other, with no particular sense of self-consciousness, both of us calmed by the smoke and the sleepy chirping of crickets outside. The sound of wagon wheels had ceased, but there were still people passing by. Surely I would know Jamieâ€™s step, be able to distinguish his, even among so many. . . .

â€œYouâ€™re worried about him, arenâ€™t you?â€ he asked. â€œJohn.â€

â€œNo,â€ I said quickly, but I saw one dark brow rise and remembered that he already knew me for a bad liar. â€œThat is . . . Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s quite all right. But I would have expected him home by now. And with so much commotion in the city . . .â€ I waved a hand toward the window. â€œYou donâ€™t know what might happen, do you?â€

I heard him draw breath, his chest rattling faintly, and clear his throat.

â€œAnd you still decline to tell me where he is.â€

I lifted one shoulder and let it fall; it seemed pointless to repeat that I didnâ€™t know, even though that was the truth. Instead, I took up a comb from the table and began to deal slowly with my hair, untangling and smoothing the unruly mass, enjoying the cool feel of it in my hands. After we had bathed Hal and got him put to bed, Iâ€™d taken a quarter hour for a somewhat more leisurely wash of my own and had rinsed the sweat and dust from my hair, despite knowing it would take hours to dry in the humid air.

â€œThe bargain I had in mind was not for my own life,â€ he said after a bit. â€œAs such.â€

â€œIâ€™m sure John isnâ€™t going to die, either, if thatâ€™s what youâ€”â€

â€œNot John. My son. My daughter. And my grandson. You have grandchildren, I collect? I believe I heard that rather stalwart young man call you â€˜Grannieâ€™ this afternoon, did I not?â€ His voice held a trace of amusement.

â€œYou did, and I do. You mean Dorothea? Is something the matter with her?â€ A stab of alarm made me set down the comb. Iâ€™d seen Dottie only a few days before, at the house where her brother Henry was staying.

â€œAside from the fact that she appears to be on the verge of marrying a Rebel and declares her intent to accompany the man onto battlefields and to live with him under the most insalubrious conditions imaginable?â€

He sat up in bed and spoke with evident passion, but I couldnâ€™t help smiling at his mode of expression; evidently the Grey brothers shared the same habit of speech. I coughed to hide this, though, and replied as tactfully as possible.

â€œUm . . . youâ€™ve seen Dottie, then?â€

â€œYes, I have,â€ he said shortly. â€œShe was with Henry when I arrived yesterday, and wearing the most extraordinary garment. Evidently the man to whom she considers herself affianced is a Quaker, and she declares that she has become one, as well!â€

â€œSo I understand,â€ I murmured. â€œYou . . . er . . . hadnâ€™t heard about it?â€

â€œNo, I had not! And I have a few things to say to John regarding both his cowardice in not telling me about it and his sonâ€™s unpardonable machi . . . machinations . . .â€ The choler in this speech literally choked him, and he had to stop and cough, wrapping his arms round his knees to steady himself against the racking spasms.

I took up the fan Iâ€™d left on the table earlier and wafted a bit of smoke from the brazier into his face. He gasped, coughed harder for a moment, and then subsided, wheezing.

â€œIâ€™d tell you not to excite yourself, if I thought there was the slightest chance of you listening,â€ I remarked, handing him a cup of the boiled tincture of Ephedra in coffee. â€œDrink that. Slowly.

â€œAs for John,â€ I went on, watching him make faces over the bitter taste, â€œhe considered writing to you when he found out what Dottie intended. He didnâ€™t, because at the time he thought it might be nothing more than a passing whim and that once sheâ€™d seen the reality of Dennyâ€™sâ€”er, thatâ€™s her fiancÃ©, Dr. Hunterâ€”of his life, she might think better of it. And if she did, there was no need to alarm you and your wife. He never expected you to turn up here.â€

Hal coughed once, then drew breath in a tentative fashion.

â€œI didnâ€™t, either,â€ he said, and, putting the cup aside, coughed again and lay back against the heaped pillows. â€œThe War Office decided to send my regiment to support Clinton when the new strategy was decided upon; there wasnâ€™t time to write.â€

â€œWhich new strategy is this?â€ I asked, only mildly interested.

â€œTo sever the southern colonies from the north, suppress the rebellion there, and thus starve the north into submission. Keep the bloody French out of the West Indies, too,â€ he added as an afterthought. â€œYou think Dottie might change her mind?â€ He sounded dubious but hopeful.

â€œActually, no,â€ I said. I stretched and ran my fingers through my damp hair, which had settled softly on my neck and shoulders, curling light and tickling round my face. â€œI wondered whether it was you or your wife she took after in terms of willfulness, but the instant I met you, it was clear.â€

He gave me a narrow look but had the grace to smile.

â€œShe does,â€ he admitted. â€œSo does Benjaminâ€”my eldest son. Henry and Adam are both like my wife in terms of temperament. Which does not mean that they arenâ€™t capable of seeking their own way,â€ he added thoughtfully. â€œOnly that theyâ€™re rather more diplomatic about it.â€

â€œIâ€™d like to meet your wife,â€ I said, smiling, too. â€œHer name is Minnie, John said?â€

â€œMinerva,â€ he said, his smile growing more genuine. â€œMinerva Cunnegunda, to be exact. Couldnâ€™t call her â€˜Cunny,â€™ could I?â€

â€œProbably not in public, no.â€

â€œWouldnâ€™t try it in private, either,â€ he assured me. â€œSheâ€™s very demureâ€”to look at.â€

I laughed, and darted a glance at the brazier. I hadnâ€™t thought the active principle in ganja would be very strong, burned as an atmospheric rather than smoked directly. Still, it was obviously having a beneficial effect on Halâ€™s mood as well as his asthma, and I was conscious of a slight feeling of well-being beginning to creep into my own outlook. I was still worried about Jamieâ€”and Johnâ€”but the worry had lifted from my shoulders and seemed to be floating a little way above my head: still visible, and a dull purple-gray in color, but floating. Like a lead balloon, I thought, and gave a small, amused snort.

Hal was lying back, eyes half lidded, watching me with a sort of detached interest.

â€œYouâ€™re a beautiful woman,â€ he said, sounding faintly surprised. â€œNot demure, though,â€ he added, and made a low chuckling noise. â€œWhat could John have been thinking?â€

I knew what John had been thinking but didnâ€™t want to talk about itâ€”for assorted reasons.

â€œWhat did you mean earlier,â€ I asked curiously, â€œabout making bargains with God?â€

â€œAh.â€ His eyelids closed slowly. â€œWhen I arrived at General Clintonâ€™s office this morningâ€”God, was that only this morning?â€”he had rather bad news for meâ€”and a letter. Sent some weeks ago from New Jersey, forwarded eventually to him through the army post.

â€œMy eldest son, Benjamin, was captured by the Rebels at the Brandywine,â€ he said, almost dispassionately. Almost; there was enough light for me to see the bulge of his jaw muscle. â€œThere is at present no agreement with the Americans involving the exchange of prisoners, so he remains in captivity.â€

â€œWhere?â€ I asked, disturbed at the news.

â€œI donâ€™t know that,â€ he said shortly. â€œYet. But I shall discover his whereabouts as quickly as possible.â€

â€œGodspeed,â€ I said sincerely. â€œWas the letter from Benjamin?â€

â€œNo.â€ His jaw tightened a little further.

The letter had been from a young woman named Amaranthus Cowden, who informed His Grace the Duke of Pardloe that she was the wife of his son Benjaminâ€”and the mother of Benjaminâ€™s son, Trevor Wattiswade Grey, aged three months. Born after Benjamin was captured, I thought, and wondered whether Benjamin knew about the baby.

The young Mrs. Grey found herself in difficult circumstances, she wrote, owing to her husbandâ€™s sad absence, and therefore proposed to go to her relatives in Charleston. She felt some delicacy in approaching His Grace for assistance, but her state was such that she felt she had little choice in the matter and hoped that he would forgive her forwardness and look kindly upon her plea. She enclosed a lock of her sonâ€™s hair, feeling that His Grace might like to have such a keepsake of his grandson.

â€œDear me,â€ I said. I hesitated for a moment, but the same thought must surely have occurred to him. â€œDo you think sheâ€™s telling the truth?â€

He sighed, a mixture of anxiety and aggravation.

â€œAlmost certainly she is. My wifeâ€™s maiden name was Wattiswade, but no one outside the family would know that.â€ He nodded toward the wardrobe where Mrs. Figg had hung his uniform. â€œThe letter is in my coat, should you wish to read it.â€

I waved a hand in polite dismissal.

â€œI see what you meant about making bargains with God. You want to live to see your grandchildâ€”and your son, of course.â€

He sighed again, his lean body seeming to diminish slightly. Mrs. Figg had undone his queueâ€”much against his willâ€”brushed out his hair, and tied it in a loose tail that now fell over his shoulder, a soft dark brown shot with streaks of white that glinted red and gold in the fire glow.

â€œNot precisely. I do want that, of course, butâ€”â€ He groped for words, quite unlike his earlier elegant loquacity. â€œYouâ€™d die for them, happily. Your family. But at the same time you think, Christ, I canâ€™t die! What might happen to them if I werenâ€™t here?â€ He gave me a wry and rueful smile. â€œAnd you know bloody well that you mostly canâ€™t help them anyway; theyâ€™ve got to do itâ€”or notâ€”themselves.â€

â€œUnfortunately, yes.â€ A draft of air moved the muslin curtains and stirred the hanging pall of smoke. â€œNot the grandchildren, though. You can help them.â€ And I suddenly missed Henri-Christianâ€™s soft weight, his solid head against my shoulder; Iâ€™d saved his life by removing his tonsils and adenoids, and I thanked God that Iâ€™d been in time to do it. And Mandy . . . God, take care of her, I prayed fiercely. Iâ€™d been able to tell Bree what was wrong and that it could be fixedâ€”but I couldnâ€™t fix her heart defect, and I regretted that lack every day of my life. If I could have done the necessary surgery in this time, theyâ€™d all still be here. . . .

The curtains moved again, and the heavy atmosphere drew a clean, sudden breath. I inhaled deeply, catching the faint, sharp scent of ozone. â€œRain,â€ I said. â€œRainâ€™s coming.â€

The duke didnâ€™t reply but turned, lifting his face toward the window. I got up and raised the sash higher, gratefully letting in a cool breeze. I looked out into the night again; clouds were drifting fast across the moon, so the light seemed to pulse rather than flicker, like the beat of a palpitating heart. The streets were dark, with no more than the occasional glow of a moving lantern to mark the muted agitation of the city.

Rain might damp the movement, both of fleeing Loyalists and the army readying itself to depart. Would the cover of the storm make it easier for Jamie to come into the city? A bad storm might hamper him, turning the roads to mud. How far away was he?

The lead balloon had come down on my head. My mood had taken a plunge, whether from fatigue, the oncoming storm, or merely as a natural effect of cannabinol, I didnâ€™t know. I shivered, though the air was still hot, unable to keep my brain from projecting vivid images of all the dire possibilities that could befall a man caught between two armies, alone in the night.

Maybe alone. What had he done with John? Surely he wouldnâ€™t haveâ€”

â€œI was twenty-one when my father died,â€ Hal remarked out of the blue. â€œGrown. Had my own life, had a wifeâ€”â€ He broke off abruptly, his mouth twisting. â€œDidnâ€™t think I needed him at all, until he suddenly wasnâ€™t there.â€

â€œWhat could he have done for you?â€ I asked, sitting down again. I was curiousâ€”but also anxious to avoid my own racing thoughts.

Hal lifted one slender shoulder. The neck of the nightshirt was unbuttoned, both because of the heat and so I could more easily see the pulse in his neck. It fell open, the cloth limp with moisture, and his clavicle showed, high-arched and clean, shadowed sharp against his skin.

â€œBeen there,â€ he said simply. â€œListened. Perhaps . . . approved of what I was doing.â€ The last few words came low, barely audible. â€œOr maybe not. But . . . been there.â€

â€œI know what you mean,â€ I said, more to myself than to him. Iâ€™d been lucky; I was very young when my parents died, and my uncle had stepped promptly into my life, to be there for me. And casual as his own life had beenâ€”he always was there. Iâ€™d felt his loss acutely when he died, but Iâ€™d been married thenâ€”a spasm of guilt seized me out of nowhere, thinking of Frank. And another, worse, thinking of Brianna. Iâ€™d left her, onceâ€”and then she had left me.

That unleashed a jumble of morbid thoughts: of Laoghaire, abandoned by both daughters, unlikely ever to see her grandchildren, now mine. Of Jem and Mandy . . . and Jamie.

Where was he? And why wasnâ€™t he here? Surely, whatever John might have told him . . .



â€œOh, dear,â€ I said hopelessly, under my breath. I could feel the tears prick and well, pressing up against the dam of my determination.

â€œDo you know, Iâ€™m most remarkably hungry,â€ Hal said, sounding surprised. â€œIs there any food in the house?â€



JAMIEâ€™S STOMACH GROWLED, and he coughed to cover the sound, but there was no need. The little girls were curled up like a pair of capped hedgehogs under a tattered quilt by the hearth, back to back and snoring like drunken bumblebees. Mrs. Hardman was on the settle, singing to the baby under her breath. He couldnâ€™t make out the words, so he couldnâ€™t tell what song it was, but imagined it to be a lullaby. On the other hand, heâ€™d heard Highland women sing their babes asleep often enough with things like â€œNighean Nan Geug,â€ which dealt with severed heads and blood-soaked ground. But Mrs. Hardman was a Friend; presumably sheâ€™d have no truck with that sort of lullaby. Maybe â€œThe Great Silkie of Sule Skerry,â€ he thought, beginning to relax. Clearly Friends had no objection to carnal relations as such . . .

That reminded him of bloody John Grey, and he grimaced, then stifled a grunt as his back sent a warning shot down his leg, indicating that even that much movement wouldnâ€™t be tolerated.

The song was no more music to him than the snoring, but both were gentle sounds, and he eased himself cautiously, checked that knife and pistol were easily to hand, and shut his eyes. He was tired to the bone but doubted heâ€™d sleep. He couldnâ€™t even shift himself in the bed without white stabs of pain jabbing him in the backside like the devilâ€™s pitchfork.

It had been years since his back had last done this to him. Ached frequently, now and then was stiff in the morning, but it hadnâ€™t done this in . . . ten years? He remembered it vividly. It was soon after theyâ€™d come to the Ridge, just after he and Ian built the cabin. Heâ€™d gone out a-hunting, sprung over a bank in pursuit of a fleeing elk, and found himself lying on his face at the foot of the bank, quite unable to move.

Claire, bless her, had come searching for himâ€”he smiled wryly at thought of it; sheâ€™d been so proud of tracking him through the forest. If she hadnâ€™t found him . . . well, it would have been the luck of the draw as to whether a painter, bear, or wolf came upon him before his back released its clench and let him move. He supposed he wouldnâ€™t have died of cold, though he might well have lost a few toes to frostbite.

Sheâ€”

A sound brought his head up, fast. His back stabbed viciously, but he set his teeth, ignoring it, and pulled the pistol out from underneath his pillow.

Mrs. Hardmanâ€™s head jerked up at his movement. She stared at him, wide-eyed, then heard what he had heard and got up hastily. Feet on the path, more than one pair. She turned, looking for the cradle, but he shook his head.

â€œKeep the bairnie with ye,â€ he said, low-voiced. â€œAnswer when they knock, open if they ask.â€



He saw her swallow, but she did as he said. There were three or four, he thought, but not bent on mischief. There were feet on the porch, low murmurs, and a bit of laughing. A knock, and Mrs. Hardman called, â€œWhoâ€™s there?â€

â€œFriends, missus,â€ said a manâ€™s voice, slurred with drink. â€œLet us in.â€

She cast a frightened glance at Jamie, but he nodded, and she lifted the latch, opening the door to the night. The first man started to come in but then saw Jamie on the bed and stopped, mouth open.

â€œGood eveninâ€™ to ye,â€ Jamie said, polite, but holding the other manâ€™s eyes with his own. The pistol lay in plain sight, under his hand.

â€œOh,â€ said the other man, disconcerted. He was young and rather stout, dressed in hunting garb but with a militia badge; he glanced over his shoulder at his companions, who had stopped on the threshold. â€œIâ€”erâ€”good evening to you, sir. We didnâ€™tâ€”erâ€”we thought . . .â€ He cleared his throat.

Jamie smiled at him, well aware what he thought. Keeping the man in sight from the corner of his eye, he turned to Mrs. Hardman and gestured to her to sit down. She did and bent her head over the child, brushing her lips over Chastityâ€™s tiny cap.

â€œWeâ€™ve nothing to offer ye in the way of food, gentlemen,â€ Jamie said. â€œBut thereâ€™s cold water from the well, and a bed in the shed, if ye need it.â€

The other two men stood outside, shuffling awkwardly. There was a strong smell of liquor coming off them, but they hadnâ€™t come in a mood to do damage.

â€œThatâ€™s all right,â€ the young man said, backing up to his friends. His round face was flushed, as much with embarrassment as with liquor. â€œWeâ€™ll just . . . sorry to disturb you. Sir.â€

The other two bobbed their heads, and all three retreated, shuffling and bumping into one another in their haste to leave. The last one pulled the door to, but not all the way. Mrs. Hardman rose and pushed it to with a small bang, then leaned against it, her eyes closed, the child clasped against her bosom.

â€œThank you,â€ she whispered.

â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ he said. â€œTheyâ€™ll not come back. Put the bairn down and bar the door, aye?â€

She did, then turned and leaned against the door, her hands pressed flat against it. She looked at the floor between her feet, breathing audibly for a moment, then slowly straightened.

Her plain jacket was fastened with pinsâ€”he didnâ€™t know if this was to avoid the vanity of buttons, as the Moravians did, or whether she was simply too poor to have any. Her fingers fiddled nervously with the top pin, and then she suddenly pulled it out and laid it glinting on the shelf. She looked directly at him then, her fingers gripping the head of the next pin. Her long upper lip was pressed down, and a nervous sweat glistened on it.

â€œDinna even think about it,â€ he said bluntly. â€œIn my present condition, I couldna swive a dead sheep. To say nothing of which, Iâ€™m old enough to be your father, lassâ€”and Iâ€™m marrit, forbye.â€

Her mouth quivered slightly, though he couldnâ€™t tell whether with disappointment or relief. Her fingers relaxed, though, and her hand dropped to her side.

â€œYe dinna need to pay me for the food, lass,â€ he said. â€œIt was a gift.â€

â€œIâ€”yes, I know. I thank thee, Friend.â€ She looked aside, swallowing a little. â€œI onlyâ€”I hoped that perhapsâ€”thee might stay. For a time.â€ â€œIâ€™m marrit, lass,â€ he repeated gently, then, after an uncomfortable pause, felt compelled to ask, â€œDo ye have such callers often?â€ It had been clear to him that the men were strangers to herâ€”but she was not to them. Theyâ€™d heard of the Quaker woman who lived alone with three young girls.

â€œI take them to the shed,â€ she blurted, her face going redder than the flames made it. â€œAfter the girls are asleep.â€

â€œMmphm,â€ he said, after another pause that lasted much too long. His eyes went to the cradle but then shot away. He wondered how long Mr. Hardman had been gone from home, but it wasnâ€™t his business. Nor was it his business how she managed to feed her girls.

â€œSleep, lass,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™ll keep watch.â€





MORNING AIR AWASH WITH ANGELS

Next day

JAMIE AWOKE TO THE smell of frying meat and sat up straight in bed, forgetting his back.

â€œLord have mercy,â€ said Mrs. Hardman, looking over her shoulder. â€œI havenâ€™t heard a noise like that since the last time my husband, Gabriel, killed a pig.â€ She shook her head and returned to her cookery, pouring batter into an oiled cast-iron spider that sat in the coals, smoking and spitting in a baleful sort of way.

â€œI beg your pardon, maâ€™amâ€”â€

â€œSilvia is my name, Friend. And thine?â€ she asked, raising one brow at him.

â€œFriend Silvia,â€ he said through clenched teeth. â€œMy name Is Jamie. Jamie Fraser.â€ Heâ€™d raised his knees in the involuntary jerk that brought him upright, and now he wrapped his arms around them and laid his sweating face against the worn quilt that covered them, trying to stretch his recalcitrant back. The effort shot pain down his right leg and caused an instant sharp cramp in his left calf muscle, which made him grunt and pant until it let go.



â€œIâ€™m pleased to see thee sit up, Friend Jamie,â€ Silvia Hardman remarked, bringing him a plate filled with sausage, fried onions, and johnnycake. â€œYour back is some better, I collect?â€ She smiled at him.

â€œSomewhat,â€ he managed, and smiled back as well as he could while trying not to groan. â€œYouâ€”have fresh food, I see.â€

â€œYes, God be thanked,â€ she said fervently. â€œI sent Pru and Patience out to the main road at dawn to watch for wagons coming in to the market in Philadelphia, and they came back with a pound of sausage, two of cornmeal, a sack of oats, and a dozen eggs. Eat up!â€ She placed the wooden plate on the bed beside him, with a wooden spoon.

Jamie could see Prudence and Patience behind their mother, industriously wiping sausage grease from their empty plates with chunks of johnnycake. Easing himself gingerly around in order to put his back against the wall, he stretched out his legs, picked up the plate, and followed their example.

The food filled him with a surprising sense of well-being, and he put down the empty plate determined upon enterprise.

â€œI propose to visit your privy, Friend Silvia. But I may need some assistance to rise.â€

Once on his feet, he found that he could make shift to stagger a few inches at a time, and Prudence and Patience at once rushed up to seize him by the elbows, in the manner of small flying buttresses.

â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ Prudence advised him, squaring her puny shoulders and looking confidently up at him. â€œWe wonâ€™t let thee fall.â€

â€œIâ€™m sure ye wonâ€™t,â€ he said gravely. In fact, the little girls had a wiry strength that belied their fragile appearance, and he found their presence an actual help, as they provided something for him to hold on to for balance when it was necessary to stopâ€”as it was every few feet.

â€œTell me about the wagons that go into Philadelphia,â€ he said at one such stop, as much to make conversation as because he required the information. â€œDo they come only in the early morning?â€

â€œMostly,â€ Patience said. â€œThey go back empty an hour or two before sunset.â€ She set her feet wider, bracing herself. â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ she assured him. â€œLean on me. Thee seems summat shaky.â€

He squeezed her shoulder gently in thanks and let her take a very little of his weight. Shaky, indeed. It was more than half a mile to the main road; it would take over an hour to totter that far, even with the girlsâ€™ assistance, and the likelihood of his back freezing again and stranding him midway was yet too high to risk it. To say nothing of the risk of arriving in Philadelphia completely unable to move. By tomorrow, though . . .

â€œAnd did ye see soldiers on the road?â€ he asked, essaying a ginger step that shot pain from hip to foot. â€œOw!â€

â€œWe did,â€ Patience said, taking a tighter grip on his elbow. â€œCourage, Friend. Thee will prevail. We saw two companies of militia, and one Continental officer on a mule.â€

â€œWe saw some British solders, too, though,â€ Prudence put in, eager not to be overlooked. â€œThey were with a train of carts, going in the other direction.â€



â€œThe otherâ€”away from Philadelphia?â€ Jamie asked, his heart jumping. Was the evacuation of the British army already begun? â€œCould you see what was in the carts?â€

Prudence shrugged. â€œFurniture. Trunks and baskets. There were ladies riding atop some of the carts, though mostly they walked alongside. No room,â€ she clarified. â€œGuard thy shirttail, Friend, or thy modesty will be at risk.â€ The morning was cool and breezy, and an errant gust of wind had risen up, bellying his shirtâ€”wonderful on his sweating body, but definitely a risk to maiden eyes.

â€œShall I knot the tails between thy legs?â€ Patience inquired. â€œI can tie a granny knot, an overhand knot, or a square knot. My daddy taught me!â€

â€œDonâ€™t be silly, Patience,â€ her sister said crossly. â€œIf thee knots his shirt, how will he lift it to shit? No one can untie her knots,â€ she confided to Jamie. â€œShe always makes them too tight.â€

â€œOh, I do not, liar!â€

â€œFie upon thee, sister! Iâ€™ll tell Mummy what thee said!â€

â€œWhere is your father?â€ Jamie interrupted, wanting to stop the acrimony before they began pulling each otherâ€™s hair. They did stop and glanced at each other for a moment before replying.

â€œWe donâ€™t know,â€ Prudence said, her voice small and sad. â€œHe went a-hunting one day a year ago and didnâ€™t come back.â€

â€œIt might be that Indians took him,â€ Patience said, trying to sound hopeful. â€œIf so, may be that heâ€™ll escape one day and come home.â€

Prudence sighed.

â€œMaybe,â€ she said flatly. â€œMummy thinks the militia shot him.â€

â€œWhy?â€ Jamie asked, looking down at her. â€œWhy would they shoot him?â€

â€œFor being a Friend,â€ Patience explained. â€œHe wouldnâ€™t fight, and so they said he was a Loyalist.â€

â€œI see. Wasâ€”er, I meanâ€”is he?â€

Prudence looked at him, grateful for the â€œis.â€

â€œI donâ€™t think so. But Mummy says Philadelphia yearly meeting told everyone that all Friends should be for the King, as the King would keep peace and the Rebels seek to break it. Soâ€â€”she shruggedâ€”â€œpeople think all Friends are Loyalists.â€

â€œDaddy wasnâ€™tâ€”isnâ€™t,â€ Patience put in. â€œHe used to say all kinds of things about the King, and Mummy would get worried and beg him to hold his tongue. Hereâ€™s the privy,â€ she announced unnecessarily, letting go of Jamieâ€™s elbow in order to open the door. â€œDonâ€™t wipe thyself with the towel; itâ€™s for hands. There are corncobs in the basket.â€



JOHN GREY WOKE feverish and heavy-limbed, with a pounding headache, and a stabbing pain in his left eye when he tried to open it. Both his eyes were crusted and gummy. Heâ€™d been dreaming in vivid, fractured swaths, a confusion of images, voices, emotions . . . Jamie Fraser had been shouting at him, face dark with passion, but then something changed, some sort of pursuit began, and he fell back into queasy nightmare. They were running together through a bog, a sucking quagmire that pulled at his steps, and Fraser was struggling just ahead of him, trapped, shouting at him to go back, but he couldnâ€™t, his feet were mired fast and he was sinking, flailing madly but unable to get a purchase on anything . . .

â€œGaah!â€ A hand shook him by the shoulder, startling him out of the morass. He pried his good eye open and saw the wavering form of a neat young man in a dark coat and spectacles, peering down at him in an oddly familiar way.

â€œJohn Grey?â€ said the young man.

â€œI am,â€ he said. He swallowed painfully. â€œHave Iâ€”the honor of your acquaintance, sir?â€

The young man flushed a bit.

â€œThee has, Friend Grey,â€ he said, low-voiced. â€œI amâ€”â€

â€œOh!â€ Grey said, sitting up in a rush. â€œOf course, youâ€”oh. Oh, Jesus.â€ His head, disturbed by the abrupt change of posture, had apparently decided to fly off his shoulders and thump into the nearest wall. The young man . . . Hunter, he thought, finding the name turn up with an odd neatness among the chaos inside his skull. Dr. Hunter. Dottieâ€™s Quaker.

â€œI think thee had best lie down, Friend.â€

â€œI think I had best vomit first.â€

Hunter snatched the pot out from under the cot just in time. By the time he had administered waterâ€”â€œDrink slowly, Friend, if thee wishes to keep itâ€â€”and eased Grey back down on the cot, Colonel Smith was looming up behind him.

â€œWhat do you say, Doctor?â€ Smith was frowning and seemed worried. â€œIs he in his right mind? He was singing last night, now heâ€™s been moaning and saying odd things, and the look of him . . .â€ Smith grimaced in a fashion that made Grey wonder what the devil he did look like.

â€œHeâ€™s badly fevered,â€ Hunter said, with a piercing look through his spectacles as he bent to take hold of Greyâ€™s wrist. â€œAnd thee sees the condition of his eye. It would be dangerous to move him. A further extravasation of blood into the brain . . .â€

Smith made a discontented noise and compressed his lips. He nudged Hunter aside and bent over Grey.

â€œCan you hear me, Colonel?â€ he asked, speaking in the slow, distinct manner one used with idiots and foreigners.

â€œIch bin ein Fisch . . .â€ Grey murmured beatifically, and closed his eyes.

â€œHis pulse is much disordered,â€ Hunter said warningly, his thumb pressing Greyâ€™s wrist. His hand was cool and firm; Grey found the touch comforting. â€œI really cannot answer for the consequences should he be moved abruptly.â€

â€œI see.â€ Smith stood still for a moment; Grey could hear his heavy breathing but forbore opening his eyes. â€œVery well, then.â€ He gave a short, humorless laugh. â€œIf Mohammed cannot go to the mountain, then the mountain will jolly well have to come here. Iâ€™ll send a note to General Wayne. Do what you can, please, to see that heâ€™s coherent, Doctor?â€





HE COULD SEE Denzell Hunter out of his damaged eye; that was reassuring: he wasnâ€™t blind. Yet. Hunter had removed his spectacles in order to peer more closely into the injured organ; he had very nice eyes himself, Grey thoughtâ€”the iris just the light-brown color of the flesh of a ripe olive, with tiny streaks of deep green.

â€œLook up, please,â€ Hunter murmured.

Grey tried to oblige.

â€œOw!â€

â€œNo? Look down.â€ This attempt was no more successful, nor could he move the eye to the right or left. It seemed to have solidified in its socket, like a hard-boiled egg. He put this theory to Hunter, who smiled, though in a rather worried way.

â€œThere is a great deal of swelling, to be sure. Whatever struck thee did so with a good deal of force.â€ Hunterâ€™s fingers moved gently over Greyâ€™s face, prodding here and there in a questioning manner. â€œDoes thisâ€”â€

â€œYes, he did. Donâ€™t keep asking if it hurts; everything from my scalp to my chin hurts, including my left ear. What you said regarding extravasation of blood into the brainâ€”did you mean it?â€

â€œItâ€™s possible.â€ Hunter did smile at that, though. â€œBut since thee has shown no disposition to seizure or unconsciousnessâ€”save that due to alcoholâ€”and thee apparently walked for several hours following the injury, I think perhaps the probability is lower. There is bleeding beneath the sclera, though.â€ His cool fingertips brushed the puffy lid. â€œThy eyeball is crimson, as is the lining of thy eyelid. Itâ€™s rather . . . dramatic.â€ There was a distinct tone of amusement in this, which Grey found reassuring.

â€œOh, good,â€ he said dryly. â€œHow long will it take to go away?â€

That made the Quaker grimace and shake his head.

â€œThe blood will take a week to a month to clear; itâ€™s essentially the same as mere bruisingâ€”the bursting of small blood vessels under the skin. What worries me is thy inability to move the eye. I think thee has a fracture of the bony orbit, which is somehow trapping the orbicularis muscle. I do wish thy wife was here; she has a much greaterâ€”â€

â€œMy wife,â€ Grey said blankly. â€œOh!â€ Memory and realization collided, and he felt a sudden leap of spirit. â€œShe isnâ€™t my wife! Not anymore,â€ he added, and found himself grinning. He leaned forward to whisper into Hunterâ€™s astonished ear, â€œJamie Fraser isnâ€™t dead!â€

Hunter stared at him, blinked, put his spectacles back on, and resumed staring, obviously rethinking his appraisal of Greyâ€™s brain.

â€œHeâ€™s the one who hit me,â€ Grey said helpfully. â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ he added at Hunterâ€™s frown. â€œI was asking for it.â€

â€œGod be praised,â€ Hunter whispered, breaking into a huge smileâ€”apparently at the news of Fraserâ€™s survival rather than Greyâ€™s assurance of the morality of his actions. â€œIan will beâ€”â€ He broke off with a gesture indicating his inability to describe Ian Murrayâ€™s probable emotions.

â€œAnd Friend Claire!â€ he exclaimed, eyes huge behind his spectacles. â€œDoes she know?â€

â€œYes, butâ€”â€ Approaching footsteps made Grey hurl himself back onto the cot, with a completely authentic exclamation of pain. He shut his eyes and rolled his head to one side, groaning.

â€œThe mountain seems to be with General Washington,â€ Smith said, plainly disedified. Grey felt him come to a stop by the cot, bumping it with his legs. â€œDo what you can to see that heâ€™s capable of travel by tomorrow, Doctorâ€”weâ€™ll load him into one of the wagons, if necessary.â€

Number 17 Chestnut Street

HIS GRACE WOKE up in the morning red-eyed as a ferret and in roughly the same temper as a rabid badger. Had I a tranquilizing dart, I would have shot him with it without an instantâ€™s hesitation. As it was, I prescribed a large slug of brandy to be added to his breakfast coffee andâ€”after a brief struggle with my Hippocratic conscienceâ€”added a very small amount of laudanum to it.

I couldnâ€™t give him much; it depressed the respiration, among other things. Still, I reasoned, counting the aromatic reddish-brown drops as they plinked into the brandy, it was a more humane way of dealing with him than crowning him with the chamber pot or calling Mrs. Figg to sit on him whilst I tied him to the bedstead and gagged him.

And I did require him to be both immobile and quiet for a short period. Mr. Figg, a preacher of the Methodist Society, was bringing round two young men of the society who were carpenters, to rehang the front door and nail boards over the shutters of the downstairs windows, in case of roving mobs. Iâ€™d told Mrs. Figg that of course she might confide our circumstances to her husbandâ€”I couldnâ€™t very well stop herâ€”but that perhaps he might be persuaded not to mention His Graceâ€™s presence, in the interests of protecting Lord Johnâ€™s safety and propertyâ€”to say nothing of His Grace, who was, after all, Lord Johnâ€™s presumably beloved brother.

Mrs. Figg would cheerfully have handed the duke over to be tarred and feathered, but an appeal on Lord Johnâ€™s behalf would always carry weight with her, and she nodded in sober agreement. So long as His Grace didnâ€™t draw attention to himself by shouting out of the upstairs window or hurling things at the workmen, she thought his presence could be concealed.

â€œWhat you mean to do with him, though, Lady John?â€ she asked, glancing warily toward the ceiling. We were standing in the back parlor, conferring in lowered voices while Jenny administered Halâ€™s breakfast and made sure all the brandy-laced coffee was drunk. â€œAnd what if the army sends someone round to ask after him?â€

I made a helpless gesture.

â€œI have no idea,â€ I confessed. â€œI just need to keep him here until either Lord John or myâ€”er, Mr. Fraserâ€”comes. Theyâ€™ll know what to do with him. As for the army, if anyone comes asking after His Grace, Iâ€™ll . . . um . . . speak to them.â€

She gave me a look indicating that sheâ€™d heard better plans, but nodded reluctantly and went off to fetch her marketing basket. The first thing that happens in a newly occupied city is a shortage of food, and with the Continental army poised to descend on Philadelphia like a plague of locusts, the wagons that normally brought in produce from the countryside would likely be sparse. If either army was on the road already, theyâ€™d be seizing anything that came along.

At the door, though, Mrs. Figg paused and turned around.

â€œWhat about William?â€ she demanded. â€œIf he comes back . . .â€ She was obviously torn between hope that he would come backâ€”she was worried for himâ€”and consternation at what might happen if he encountered his uncle in captivity.

â€œIâ€™ll speak to him,â€ I repeated firmly, and waved a hand toward the door.

Running upstairs, I found Hal yawning over a nearly empty breakfast tray and Jenny fastidiously wiping egg yolk off the corner of his mouth. Sheâ€™d spent the night at the printshop but had come back to help, bringing with her a battered portmanteau filled with possibly useful items.

â€œHis Grace made a good breakfast,â€ she reported, stepping back to examine her work critically. â€œAnd heâ€™s moved his bowels. I made him do that afore he drank his coffee, just in case. Wasna sure how quick it might be.â€

Hal frowned at her, though whether in puzzlement or offense, I couldnâ€™t tell. His pupils were already noticeably constricted, which gave him a slightly staring look. He blinked at me and shook his head, as though trying to clear it.

â€œLet me have a quick check of your vital signs, Your Grace,â€ I said, smiling and feeling like Judas. He was my patientâ€”but Jamie was my husband, and I hardened my resolve.

His pulse was slow and quite regular, which reassured me. I took out my stethoscope, unbuttoned his nightshirt, and had a listen: a nice, steady heartbeat, no palpitations, but the lungs were gurgling like a leaky cistern, and his breathing was interrupted by small gasps.

â€œHeâ€™d best have some of the Ephedra tincture,â€ I said, straightening up. It was a stimulant and would antagonize the opiate in his system, but I couldnâ€™t risk his stopping breathing while asleep. â€œIâ€™ll stay with him; will you go down and get a cupâ€”donâ€™t bother heating it, cold will do.â€ I wasnâ€™t sure heâ€™d stay conscious long enough to have a cup heated.

â€œI really must go to see General Clinton this morning,â€ Pardloe said, with surprising firmness, considering his foggy mental state. He cleared his throat and coughed. â€œThere are arrangements to make. . . . My regiment . . .â€

â€œAh. Er . . . where is your regiment just now?â€ I asked cautiously. If they were in Philadelphia, Halâ€™s adjutant would be starting to look for him in earnest at any minute. He might reasonably have spent the night with a son or daughter, but by now . . . and I didnâ€™t know precisely how much distraction value my forged notes might have had.

â€œNew York,â€ he replied. â€œOr at least I sincerely hope so.â€ He closed his eyes, swayed slightly, then straightened his back with a jerk. â€œLanded there. I came down to Philadelphia . . . to see Henry . . . Dottie.â€ His face twisted with pain. â€œMean . . . to go back with Clinton.â€

â€œOf course,â€ I said soothingly, trying to think. When, exactly, would Clinton and his troops leave? Assuming Pardloe to be sufficiently recovered that he wouldnâ€™t actually die without my attendance, I could give him back as soon as the exodus was under way. At that point, heâ€™d have no way of starting a major search for John and endangering Jamie. But surely Jamieâ€”with or without Johnâ€”would come back at any moment?

Who did come back was Jenny, with the Ephedra tinctureâ€”and a hammer in the pocket of her apron and three stout laths under her arm. She handed me the cup without comment and proceeded to nail the laths over the window, in a surprisingly brisk and competent manner.

Hal sipped his Ephedra slowly, watching Jenny with bemusement.

â€œWhy is she doing that?â€ he asked, though not as if he cared particularly what the answer was.

â€œHurricanes, Your Grace,â€ she said with a straight face, and zipped out to return the hammer to the carpenters, whose cheerful banging sounded like a battalion of woodpeckers attacking the house.

â€œOh,â€ Hal said. He was glancing vaguely round the room, possibly in search of his breeches, which Mrs. Figg had thoughtfully taken away and hidden in the cookhouse. His eye rested on the small pile of Willieâ€™s books I had moved to the top of the dressing table. Evidently he recognized one or more, because he said, â€œOh. William. Where is William?â€

â€œIâ€™m sure Willieâ€™s very busy today,â€ I said, and picked up his wrist again. â€œPerhaps weâ€™ll see him later.â€ His heartbeat was slow but still strong. Just as his grip loosened, I caught the empty cup and set it on the table. His head drooped, and I eased him carefully back on the pillow, propped for easier breathing.

â€œIf he comes back . . .â€ Mrs. Figg had said of Willie, with the obvious implication, â€œwhat then?â€

What indeed?

Colenso had not returned, so presumably he had found William; that was reassuring. But what William was doingâ€”or thinking . . .





INCIPIENT THUNDER

â€œAN ASSIGNMENT BEFITTING your peculiar situation,â€ Major Findlay had said. Findlay didnâ€™t know the half of it, William reflected bitterly. Not that his situation wasnâ€™t â€œpeculiar,â€ even without his recent discoveries.

He had surrendered at Saratoga, with the rest of Burgoyneâ€™s army, in October of â€™77. The British soldiers and their German allies had been obliged to yield their weapons but were not to be held prisoner; the Convention of Saratoga, signed by Burgoyne and by the Continental general, Gates, had stated that all troops would be allowed to return to Europe, once they had given their parole not to take up arms again in the American conflict.

But ships could not sail during the winter storms, and something had to be done with the captured soldiers. Referred to as the Convention army, they had been marched en masse to Cambridge, Massachusetts, there to await spring and repatriation. All but William and a few like him, who had either connections in America with influence, or connections with Sir Henry, who had succeeded Howe as commander in chief of the American campaign.

William, fortunate fellow, had both; he had served on Howeâ€™s personal staff, his uncle was the colonel of a regiment, and his father was an influential diplomat, presently in Philadelphia. He had been released under an exceptional personal parole, as a favor to General Lord Howe, and sent to Lord John. He was, however, still part of the British army, merely precluded from actual fighting. And the army had any number of obnoxious chores that did not involve fighting; General Clinton had been delighted to make use of him.

Deeply galled by his situation, William had begged his father to try to have him exchanged; that would remove the conditions of his parole and allow him to resume full military duties. Lord John had been quite willing to do this, but in January of 1778 there had been a falling-out between General Burgoyne and the Continental Congress over the formerâ€™s refusal to provide a list of the surrendered soldiers. The Convention of Saratoga had been repudiated by the Congress, which then declared that it would detain the entire Convention army until the convention and the required list were ratified by King Georgeâ€”the Congress knowing damned well that the King would do no such thing, as such an act would be tantamount to acknowledging the independence of the colonies. The upshot of this was that there was at present no mechanism at all for the exchange of prisoners. Any prisoners.

Which left William in a deeply ambiguous position. Technically, he was an escaped prisoner, and in the highly unlikely event that he was recaptured by the Americans and discovered to be one of the Saratoga officers, he would promptly be marched off to Massachusetts to languish for the rest of the war. At the same time, no one was quite sure whether it was appropriate for him to take up arms again, since even though the convention had been repudiated, William had been given a personal parole.

Which had led to Williamâ€™s present invidious situation, in charge of troops assisting the evacuation of Philadelphiaâ€™s richest Loyalists. The only thing he could think of that might be worse was driving a herd of swine through the eye of a needle.

While the poorer citizens who felt endangered by the proximity of General Washingtonâ€™s militias were obliged to brave the dangers of the road, making their exodus by wagon, handcart, and foot, the wealthier Loyalists were allowed a safer and theoretically more luxurious removal by ship. And not one of them could be brought to understand that there was but one ship presently availableâ€”General Howeâ€™s own shipâ€”and very limited room aboard it.

â€œNo, madam, Iâ€™m very sorry, but itâ€™s quite impossible to accommodateâ€”â€



â€œNonsense, young man, my husbandâ€™s grandfather purchased that tall clock in the Netherlands in 1670. It displays not only the time but also the phases of the moon and a complete table of tides for the Bay of Napoli! Surely you do not expect me to allow such an instrument to fall into the clutches of the Rebels?â€

â€œYes, madam, Iâ€™m afraid I do. No, sir, no servants; only the members of your immediate family and a very small amount of baggage. Iâ€™m sure that your bond servants will be perfectly safe following byâ€”â€

â€œBut theyâ€™ll starve!â€ exclaimed a cadaverous-looking gentleman who was loath to part with his talented cook and a plumply voluptuous housemaid, who, if not talented at sweeping, obviously had other desirable abilities, these clearly on display. â€œOr be abducted! They are my responsibility! Surely you cannotâ€”â€

â€œI can,â€ said William firmly, with an appreciative sideways glance at the housemaid, â€œand I must. Corporal Higgins, please see Mr. Henningsâ€™s bond servants safely off the quay. No, madam. I agree that the matched armchairs are quite valuable, but so are the lives of the people who will drown if the ship sinks. You may take your carriage clock, yes.â€ He raised his voice and bellowed, â€œLieutenant Rendill!â€

Rendill, face red and streaming, fought his way through the crowd of pushing, cursing, heaving, shrieking evacuees. Arriving in front of William, who was perched on a box in order to avoid being trampled or pushed into the water by the crowd, the lieutenant saluted but was rudely jostled by several people attempting to gain Williamâ€™s attention and ended with his wig pushed over his eyes.

â€œYes, sir?â€ he said gamely, pushing it back and elbowing a gentleman out of the way as politely as possible.

â€œHereâ€™s a list of General Howeâ€™s particular acquaintances, Rendill. Go on board and see if theyâ€™ve all made itâ€”if they havenâ€™t . . .â€ He cast an eloquent glance over the surging throng on the dock, surrounded by mountains of semi-abandoned possessions and trampled baggage, and thrust the list unceremoniously into the lieutenantâ€™s hand. â€œFind them.â€

â€œOh, God,â€ said Rendill. â€œI mean . . . yes, sir. At once, sir.â€ And, with a hopeless air, he turned and began to swim through the crowd, doing a modified but vigorous form of breaststroke.

â€œRendill!â€

Rendill obediently turned and made his way resignedly back into earshot, a stout red porpoise surging his way through shoals of hysterical herring.

â€œSir?â€

William leaned down and lowered his voice to a level inaudible to the press of people around them, then nodded at the piles of furniture and baggage heaped unsteadily all over the dockâ€”many of them dangerously close to the edge.

â€œAs you pass, tell the fellows on the dock that they should take no great pains to preserve those heaps of things from falling into the river, would you?â€

Rendillâ€™s perspiring face brightened amazingly.

â€œYes, sir!â€ He saluted and swam off again, radiating renewed enthusiasm, and William, his soul slightly soothed, turned courteously to attend to the complaint of a harried German father with six daughters, all of them carrying what appeared to be their entire lavish wardrobes, anxious round faces peering out between the brims of their wide straw hats and the piles of silk and lace in their arms.

Paradoxically, the heat and incipient thunder in the air suited his mood, and the sheer impossibility of his task relaxed him. Once heâ€™d realized the ultimate futility of satisfying all these peopleâ€”or even one in ten of themâ€”he stopped worrying about it, took what steps he could to preserve order, and let his mind go elsewhere while he bowed courteously and made noises of reassurance to the phalanx of faces pressing in upon him.

Had he been in a mood for irony, he reflected, there was plenty of it to go round. He was neither fish nor fowl nor good red beef, as the country folk said of an ambiguous cut of meat. Not a full soldier, not a free civilian. And, evidently, neither an Englishman nor an earl . . . and yet . . . how could he possibly not be an Englishman, for Godâ€™s sake?

Once he had regained enough of his temper to think, he had realized that he was still legally the Ninth Earl of Ellesmere, regardless of his paternity. His parentsâ€”his real parentsâ€”his theoretically real parentsâ€”had undeniably been married at the time of his birth. At the moment, though, that seemed to make matters worse: how could he go about letting people think and act as though he were the heir of Ellesmereâ€™s ancient blood when he knew damned well that he was really the son ofâ€”

He choked that thought off, shoving it violently to the back of his mind. â€œSon ofâ€ had brought Lord John vividly to mind, though. He breathed deep of the hot, murky, fish-smelling air, trying to quell the sudden pang that came to him at thought of Papa.

He hadnâ€™t wanted to admit it to himself, but heâ€™d been looking through the crowd all day, scanning the faces in search of his faâ€”yes, dammit, his father! John Grey was as much his father now as he ever had been. Goddamned liar or not. And William was growing worried about him. Colenso had reported that morning that Lord John had not returned to his houseâ€”and Lord John should have returned by now. And if he had, he would have come to find William, he was sure of that. Unless Fraser had killed him.

He swallowed bile at the thought. Why would he? The men had once been friends, good friends.

True, war severed such bonds. But even soâ€”

On account of Mother Claire? He recoiled from that thought, too, but made himself come back to it. He could still see her face, glowing in spite of the uproar, fierce as flame with the joy of seeing Jamie Fraser, and felt a prick of jealousy on behalf of his father. If Fraser felt similarly impassioned, might he . . . but that was nonsense! Surely he must realize that Lord John had only taken her under his protectionâ€”and done that for the sake of his good friend!

But, then, they were married . . . and his father had always been quite open regarding matters of sex. . . . His face grew even hotter, with embarrassment at the vision of his father enthusiastically bedding the not-quite-ex-Mrs. Fraser. And if Fraser had discovered thatâ€”

â€œNo, sir!â€ he said sharply to the importunate merchant whoâ€”he realized belatedlyâ€”had just tried to bribe him to admit the merchantâ€™s family to Howeâ€™s ship. â€œHow dare you? Begone, and think yourself fortunate that I have no time to deal with you as I ought!â€

The man shuffled disconsolately away, and William felt a small pang of regret, but there was in fact little he could do. Even had he felt able to stretch a point in the merchantâ€™s favor, once a bribe was offered, he had no choice.

Even if it were true, how would Fraser have discovered it? Surely Lord John wouldnâ€™t have been foolish enough to tell him. No, it must be something else that was delaying Papaâ€™s returnâ€”doubtless the muddle of people leaving Philadelphia; the roads must be choked. . . .

â€œYes, madam. I think we have room for you and your daughter,â€ he said to a young mother, very frightened-looking, with a baby clutched against her shoulder. He reached out and touched the infantâ€™s cheek; she was awake, but not troubled by the crowd, and regarded him with soft brown long-lashed eyes. â€œHallo, sweetheart. Want to go on a boat with your mummy?â€

The mother gave a stifled sob of relief.

â€œOh, thank you, Lordâ€”it is Lord Ellesmere, is it not?â€

â€œIt is,â€ he said automatically, and then felt as though someone had punched him in the belly. He swallowed and his face burned.

â€œMy husband is Lieutenant Beaman Gardner,â€ she said, offering the name in anxious justification of his mercy, and bobbed a short curtsy. â€œWeâ€™ve met. At the Mischianza?â€

â€œYes, of course!â€ he said, bowing, though he didnâ€™t recall Mrs. Lieutenant Gardner at all. â€œHonored to be of service to a brother officerâ€™s wife, maâ€™am. If you will be so good as to go on board directly, please? Corporal Anderson? Escort Mrs. Gardner and Miss Gardner on board.â€

He bowed again and turned away, feeling as though his insides had been scooped out. Brother officer. My lord. And what would Mrs. Lieutenant Gardner have thought if sheâ€™d known? What would the lieutenant himself think?

He sighed deeply, closing his eyes for an instantâ€™s escape. And when he opened them, found himself face-to-face with Captain Ezekiel Richardson.

â€œStercus!â€ he exclaimed, startled into his uncle Halâ€™s habit of Latin denunciation in moments of extreme stress.

â€œIndeed,â€ Richardson remarked politely. â€œMay I have a word with you? Yes, just soâ€”Lieutenant!â€ He beckoned to the nearby Rendill, who was eyeball-to-eyeball with an elderly woman in black bombazine with no fewer than four small dogs yapping at her heels, these held by a long-suffering small black boy. Rendill made a quelling motion to her and turned to Richardson.

â€œSir?â€

â€œRelieve Captain Lord Ellesmere, please. I require a moment of his time.â€

Before William could decide whether to object or not, Richardson had him by the elbow and was towing him out of the scrum and into the lee of a neat little sky-blue boathouse that stood on the riverbank.

William breathed deep with relief as the shade fell upon him but had by then gathered his wits. His first impulse had been to speak sharply to Richardsonâ€”followed perhaps by knocking him into the riverâ€”but wisdom spoke in his ear, advising otherwise.

It was at Richardsonâ€™s instigation that William had become for a short time an intelligencer for the army, collecting information in the context of various journeys and delivering this to Richardson. On the last of these missions, though, a journey into the Great Dismal Swamp of Virginia, William had had the misfortune to become lost, be wounded, and suffer a fever that would certainly have killed him had Ian Murray not found and rescued himâ€”in the course of the rescue informing William that he had almost certainly been gulled and sent not into the bosom of British allies but into a nest of Rebels, who would hang him should they discover who he was.

William was of two minds as to whether to believe Murray or notâ€”particularly after the arrival of Jamie Fraser had made it patently clear that Murray was his own cousin but hadnâ€™t felt it necessary to apprise him of the fact. But a deep suspicion of Richardson and his motives remained, and it was no friendly face that he turned on the man.

â€œWhat do you want?â€ he said abruptly.

â€œYour father,â€ Richardson replied, causing Williamâ€™s heart to give a great thump that he thought must be audible to the other. â€œWhere is Lord John?â€

â€œI havenâ€™t the slightest idea,â€ William said shortly. â€œI havenâ€™t seen him since yesterday.â€ The day my bloody life ended. â€œWhat do you want with him?â€ he asked, not bothering with any semblance of courtesy.

Richardson twitched an eyebrow but didnâ€™t otherwise respond to his tone.

â€œHis brother, the Duke of Pardloe, has disappeared.â€

â€œTheâ€”what?â€ William stared at him for a moment, uncomprehending. â€œHis brother? Disappeared . . . from where? When?â€

â€œEvidently from your fatherâ€™s house. As to when: Lady John said that he left the house just after tea yesterday afternoon, presumably in search of your father. Have you seen him since then?â€

â€œI havenâ€™t seen him at all.â€ William felt a distinct ringing in his earsâ€”probably his brains trying to get out through them. â€œWhatâ€”I mean, I had no idea he was in Philadelphia. In the colonies at all, for that matter. When did he arrive?â€ Jesus, did he come to deal with Dottie and her Quaker? No, he canâ€™t have, he couldnâ€™t have had time . . . could he?

Richardson was squinting at him, probably trying to determine whether he was telling the truth.

â€œI havenâ€™t seen either of them,â€ William said flatly. â€œNow, if youâ€™ll excuse me, Captain . . .â€ There was a tremendous splash from the direction of the dock and a loud chorus of shock and dismay from the crowd. â€œExcuse me,â€ William repeated, and turned away.

Richardson seized him by the arm and made an effort to fix William with his gaze. William looked deliberately in the direction of his neglected duty.

â€œWhen you see either one of them, Captain Ransom, be so good as to send word to me. It would be a great helpâ€”to many people.â€

William jerked his arm free and stalked off without reply. Richardson had used his family name instead of his titleâ€”did that mean anything beyond mere rudeness? At the moment, he didnâ€™t care. He couldnâ€™t fight, he couldnâ€™t help anyone, he couldnâ€™t tell the truth, and he wouldnâ€™t live a lie. God damn it, he was stuck like a hog, mired to the hocks.

He wiped the sweat from his face on his sleeve, squared his shoulders, and strode back into the fray. All there was to do was his duty.





AN ARMY ON THE MOVE

WE WERE JUST IN time. No sooner had I closed the bedroom door on Pardloeâ€™s gentle snore than a knock came on the newly hung front door below. I hurried downstairs to find Jenny face-to-face with a British soldier, this time a lieutenant. General Clinton was escalating his inquiries.

â€œWhy, no, lad,â€ she was saying, in a tone of mild surprise, â€œthe colonel isnâ€™t here. He took tea with Lady John yesterday, but then he went off to look for his brother. His lordship hasnâ€™t come back, andâ€â€”I saw her lean closer, her voice lowered dramaticallyâ€”â€œher ladyshipâ€™s that worried. Yeâ€™ll not have news of him, I suppose?â€

This was my cue, and I came down from the landing, rather surprised to find that I was indeed â€œthat worried.â€ Tending Hal had distracted me from the situation temporarily, but by now there was no denying that something had gone seriously wrong.

â€œLady John. Lieutenant Roswell, your servant, maâ€™am.â€ The lieutenant bowed, with a professional smile that didnâ€™t hide the slight furrowing of his brow. The army was getting worried, too, and that was bloody dangerous. â€œYour servant, mum. Have you in fact had no word from Lord John or Lord Meltonâ€”oh, I beg your pardon, my lady, I mean from His Grace?â€

â€œDâ€™ye think Iâ€™m a liar, lad?â€ Jenny said tartly.

â€œOh! No, mum, not at all,â€ he said, flushing. â€œBut the general will want to know that I spoke with her ladyship.â€

â€œOf course,â€ I said soothingly, though my heart was pittering in my throat. â€œTell the general that I havenâ€™t heard from my husbandâ€â€”either of themâ€”â€œat all. Iâ€™m most disturbed.â€ I wasnâ€™t a good liar, but I wasnâ€™t lying now.

He grimaced.

â€œThe thing is, mum, the army has begun withdrawing from Philadelphia, and all Loyalists remaining in the city are being advised that they may wish to . . . er . . . make preparations.â€ His lips compressed for a moment as he glanced at the stairwell, with its ruined banister and bloody fist marks. â€œI . . . see that you have already experienced some . . . difficulty?â€

â€œOch, no,â€ Jenny said, and with a deprecating glance at me, stepped nearer the lieutenant and put her hand on his arm, pushing him gently toward the door. He automatically moved away with her, and I heard her murmur, â€œ. . . no but a wee family quarrel . . . his lordship . . .â€

The lieutenant shot me a swift glance, in which surprise mingled with a certain sympathy. But the lines in his forehead eased. He had an explanation to take back to Clinton.

Blood flamed in my cheeks at his lookâ€”as though there truly had been a family row, during which Lord John had stamped out, leaving wreckage in his wake and a wife at the mercy of the Rebels. True, it was a family row, but the circumstances were more through-the-looking-glass than a matter of mere common scandal.

The White Rabbit shut our new door firmly on Lieutenant Roswell and turned to me, back pressed against it.

â€œLord Melton?â€ she asked, one black eyebrow raised.

â€œItâ€™s one of the dukeâ€™s titles, one he used before he became Duke of Pardloe. Lieutenant Roswell must have known him some years ago,â€ I explained.

â€œOh, aye. Well, lord or duke, how long can we keep him asleep?â€ she asked.

â€œThe laudanum will keep him out for two or three hours,â€ I replied, glancing at the gilt carriage clock on the mantel, which had somehow escaped the carnage. â€œBut he had a very hard day yesterday and a rather disturbed night; he may well go straight off into a natural sleep as the drug wears off. If no one comes along to knock the house down round our ears,â€ I added, wincing at sounds of a violent altercation somewhere nearby.

Jenny nodded. â€œAye. Iâ€™d best go along to the printshop now, then, to see what the news in the city is. And perhaps Jamie will haâ€™ gone there,â€ she added hopefully. â€œNot thinking it safe to come here, I mean, wiâ€™ the streets full of soldiers.â€

A spark of hope at the suggestion flared up like a lit match. Though even as I envisioned the possibility, I knew that if Jamie was in the city at all, heâ€™d be standing before me right now. Possibly enraged, possibly disturbed, but before me.

With the army already beginning its withdrawal, and the concomitant public disturbances, no one would have time or inclination to noticeâ€”let alone arrestâ€”a tall Scotsman suspected of nothing more than passing suspicious documents. It wasnâ€™t as though there was an all points bulletin out on himâ€”or at least I hoped not. William was the only soldier who knew that Jamie had taken Lord John hostage, and from his manner in leaving, I rather thought that the last thing William would have done was give a full report of the situation to his superiors.

I said as much to Jenny, though agreed that she ought to go back to the printshop, to check on the welfare of Fergus and Marsaliâ€™s family, as well as to find out what was going on amongst the Rebels in the city.

â€œWill you be safe in the streets?â€ I asked, unfolding her cloak and holding it up for her to put on.

â€œOh, I expect so,â€ she said briskly. â€œNo one much thinks to look at an auld woman. But I suppose Iâ€™d best put away my wee bawbee.â€ The bawbee in question was a small silver chiming watch, with a delicately filigreed cover, which she wore pinned to the bosom of her dress.

â€œJamie bought it for me in Brest,â€ she explained, seeing me looking at it as she unpinned it. â€œI told him it was foolery; I didna need such a thing to ken the time, nay more than he did himself. But he said, no, I must have it, that knowing what oâ€™clock it is gives ye the illusion that ye have some control over your circumstances. Ye ken how he is,â€ she added, putting the watch carefully away in her pocket, â€œalways explaining ye to yourself. Though I will say as heâ€™s no often wrong.

â€œNow, then,â€ she added, turning to me as she opened the door. â€œIâ€™ll come back before him upstairs wakes up, unless I canâ€™t, and if I canâ€™t, Iâ€™ll send Germain to say so.â€

â€œWhy should you not be able to?â€ I asked, in some surprise.

â€œYoung Ian,â€ she said, equally surprised that I should not have thought of this. â€œWiâ€™ the army leaving, he may have come back from Valley Forge by nowâ€”and ye ken, the poor lad thinks Iâ€™m dead.â€





ROOM FOR SECRETS

In the forest,

five miles from Valley Forge

â€œDO QUAKERS BELIEVE in heaven?â€ Ian Murray asked.

â€œSome do,â€ Rachel Hunter replied, pausing to turn over a large toadstool with the toe of her shoe. â€œNo, dog, donâ€™t touch that one. See the color of its gills?â€ Rollo, who had come to sniff at the fungus, dismissed it with a perfunctory sneeze and lifted his snout to the wind in hopes of more promising prey.

â€œAuntie Claire says dogs canna see colors,â€ Ian remarked. â€œAnd what dâ€™ye mean, â€˜Some doâ€™? Is there a difference of opinion on the matter?â€ Quaker beliefs puzzled him beyond measure, but he found Rachelâ€™s explanations invariably entertaining.

â€œPerhaps they smell them instead. The dogs, I mean. But to return to thy question, we consider our life here on earth to be a sacrament, lived in the light of Christ. There may be an afterlife, but as no one has come back to say so, itâ€™s a matter of speculation, left to each person individually.â€

They had paused in the shade of a small walnut grove, and the soft green sun that fell flickering through the leaves gave Rachel herself an unearthly glow that any angel might have envied.

â€œWell, I havena been there, either, so Iâ€™ll no just say thatâ€™s wrong,â€ he said, and bent to kiss her just above the ear. A faint rush of tiny gooseflesh stippled her temple for an instant, and the sight touched his heart.



â€œWhy does thee think of heaven?â€ she asked curiously. â€œDoes thee think there will be fighting in the city? I havenâ€™t known thee overly fearful for thy life before.â€ Valley Forge had been hoaching like a grain sack full of weevils when they left it an hour before, the soldiers salvaging what they could from the camp, molding fresh musket balls and packing cartridges, preparing to march on Philadelphia when the word was given that Clintonâ€™s men had withdrawn.

â€œOch, no. Thereâ€™ll be nay fighting in the city. Washington will try to catch Clintonâ€™s men in retreat.â€ He took her hand, small and brown and work-roughened but the fingers reassuringly strong as they turned and clasped his. â€œNay, I was thinking of my mamâ€”that I should haâ€™ liked to show her places like this.â€ He gestured toward the little clearing in which they stood, a tiny spring of an improbably deep blue welling up from the rock under their feet, overhung by a yellow wild-rose brier, humming with summer bees. â€œShe had a big yellow rose brier growinâ€™ up the wall at Lallybroch; my grandmother planted it.â€ He swallowed a small lump in his throat. â€œBut then I thought, may be as sheâ€™s happier in heaven with my da than she would be here without him.â€

Rachelâ€™s hand squeezed his, hard.

â€œShe would be with him always, in life or in death,â€ she whispered, and stood a-tiptoe to kiss him back. â€œAnd you will take me someday to see your grandmotherâ€™s rose in Scotland.â€

They stood in silence for a bit, and Ian felt his heart, clenched with a sudden grief at the thought of his mother, ease in Rachelâ€™s sympathetic company. He hadnâ€™t said it, but what he most regretted was not his inability to show his mother the beauties of America but the fact that he couldnâ€™t show her Rachel.

â€œSheâ€™d have liked ye,â€ he blurted. â€œMy mam.â€

â€œI hope that she would,â€ Rachel said, though with a tinge of dubiousness. â€œDid thee tell her about me, in Scotland? That I am a Friend, I mean. Some Catholics find us scandalous.â€

Ian tried to remember whether he had mentioned that to his mother, but couldnâ€™t. It made no difference, in any case, and he shrugged, dismissing it.

â€œI told her I loved ye. That seemed to be enough. Come to think, thoughâ€”my da asked all kinds of questions about ye; he wanted to know everything he could. He kent ye were a Quaker, so that means she kent it, too.â€ He took her elbow to help her down from the rock.

She nodded, thoughtful, but as she followed him out of the clearing, he heard her ask behind him, â€œDoes thee think a married couple should be completely in each otherâ€™s confidenceâ€”share not only their histories, I mean, but every thought?â€

That sent a qualm skittering down his backbone like a mouse with cold feet, and he took a deep breath. He loved Rachel with every fiber of his being, but he found her apparent ability to read him like a bookâ€”if not to actually hear his thoughts, and sometimes he thought for sure she did that, tooâ€”unsettling.

He had in fact suggested that they walk together to Matsonâ€™s Ford and meet Denzell with the wagon there, rather than ride with him from Valley Forge, so that Ian might have sufficient time and solitude in which to share a few necessary things with her. Heâ€™d rather be tortured by Abenakis than tell her some of those things, but it was right she should know them, no matter what the result might be.

â€œAye. I mean . . . well, so far as one can, I think they maybe should. Not every thought, I dinna mean, but important things. Ahh . . . history, like ye said. Here, come sit for a wee while.â€ There was a big fallen log, half rotted and covered with moss and fuzzy gray lichens, and he led her to it, sitting down beside her in the fragrant shade of a big red cedar.

She didnâ€™t say anything, but lifted a brow in question.

â€œWell.â€ He drew a deep breath, feeling that there wasnâ€™t enough air in the whole forest for this. â€œDid ye ken . . . Iâ€™ve been marrit before?â€

Her face flickered, surprise overcome by determination so fast that heâ€™d have missed it if he hadnâ€™t been watching so close.

â€œI did not,â€ she said, and began to pleat the folds of her skirt, one-handed, clear hazel eyes fixed intently on his face. â€œThee did say been married. Thee isnâ€™t now, I suppose?â€

He shook his head, feeling a little easierâ€”and very grateful to her. Not every young woman would have taken it so calmly.

â€œNo. I wouldna have spoken to yeâ€”asked ye to marry me, I meanâ€”otherwise.â€

She pursed her lips a little and her eyes narrowed.

â€œIn point of fact,â€ she said thoughtfully, â€œthee never has asked me to marry thee.â€

â€œI didnâ€™t?â€ he said, staggered. â€œAre ye sure?â€

â€œI would have noticed,â€ she assured him gravely. â€œNo, thee didnâ€™t. Though I recall a few very moving declarations, there was no suggestion of marriage among them.â€

â€œButâ€”well.â€ Heat had risen in his cheeks. â€œIâ€”but you . . . ye said . . .â€ Maybe she was right. She had said . . . or had she? â€œDid ye not say ye loved me?â€

Her mouth turned up just a little, but he could see her laughing at him at the back of her eyes.

â€œNot in so many words. But I did give thee to understand that, yes. Or at least I meant to.â€

â€œOh. Well, then,â€ he said, much happier. â€œYe did.â€ And he pulled her into his one sound arm and kissed her with great fervor. She kissed him back, panting a little, her fists curled in the fabric of his shirt, then broke away, looking mildly dazed. Her lips were swollen, the skin around them pink, scraped by his beard.

â€œPerhaps,â€ she said, and swallowed, pushing him away with one hand flat on his chest, â€œperhaps thee should finish telling me about not being married, before we go further? Who was thyâ€”thy wifeâ€”and what happened to her?â€

He let go of her reluctantly but would not surrender her hand. It felt like a small live thing, warm in his.

â€œHer name is Wakyoâ€™teyehsnonhsa,â€ he said, and felt the accustomed inner shift at the speaking of it, as though the line between his Mohawk self and his white self had momentarily disappeared, leaving him awkwardly suspended somewhere in between. â€œIt means â€˜Works With Her Hands.â€™â€ He cleared his throat. â€œI called her Emily. Most of the time.â€

Rachelâ€™s small, smooth hand jerked in his.

â€œIs?â€ she said, blinking. â€œThee said is? Thy wife is alive?â€

â€œShe was a year ago,â€ he said, and, with an effort, didnâ€™t cling to her hand but let her take it back. She folded her hands in her lap, fixed her eyes on him, and swallowed; he saw her throat move.

â€œAll right,â€ she said, with no more than a faint tremor in her voice. â€œTell me about her.â€

He took another deep breath, trying to think how to do that, but then abandoned the effort and spoke simply.

â€œDâ€™ye truly want to know that, Rachel? Or do ye only want to ken whether I loved herâ€”or whether I love her now?â€

â€œStart there,â€ she said, lifting one brow. â€œDoes thee love her?â€

â€œIâ€”yes,â€ he said, helpless to speak other than the truth to her. Rollo, sensing some disturbance among his pack, got up from his resting place and padded over to Rachel. He sat down by her foot, making his allegiance in the matter clear, and gave Ian a yellow-eyed wolf look over Rachelâ€™s knee that bore an uncomfortable resemblance to the look in her own eye. â€œBut . . .â€

The brow lifted a fraction of an inch higher.

â€œShe . . . was my refuge,â€ he blurted. â€œWhen I left my own family and became a Mohawk, it was as much to be wiâ€™ her as because I had to.â€

â€œHad to . . . what?â€ She looked baffled, and he saw her eyes drop a little, tracing the tattooed lines across his cheekbones. â€œThee had to become a Mohawk? Why?â€

He nodded, feeling momentarily on firmer ground. He could tell her this story; it was only what had happened. Her eyes went round when he explained how he and Uncle Jamie had met Roger Wakefield, not realized who he was and thought him to be the man who had raped his cousin Brianna and got her with child, had come close to killing him, but had thought better of the notionâ€”

â€œOh, good,â€ Rachel said, half under her breath. He glanced sidelong at her but couldnâ€™t tell if she meant this ironically or not, so he coughed and went on, telling how they had instead given the man to the Tuscarora, who in turn had sold him as a slave to the Mohawk farther north.

â€œWe didna want to risk him ever cominâ€™ back to trouble Brianna, aye? Only thenâ€”â€ He swallowed, reliving in memory both the terror of his asking Brianna to marry him and the utter horror when cousin Bree had drawn a picture of the man she loved, the man she was waiting forâ€”and the strong dark features of the man they had given to the Mohawk sprang into view.

â€œYou asked thy cousin to marry thee? Did thee want to?â€ She looked wary; he supposed she must be thinking that he went about proposing to every third or fourth woman he met and hastened to correct this impression.

â€œNay, I meanâ€”well, Briannaâ€™s a . . . well, I didna mind, ken, weâ€™d haâ€™ got on fine, and sheâ€”well . . . I mean, no, not exactly,â€ he added hurriedly, seeing Rachelâ€™s graceful brows draw together. The truth was that heâ€™d been seventeen and Brianna several years older; sheâ€™d terrified him, but the thought of bedding her hadâ€”He choked that thought off as though it were a venomous snake.

â€œIt was Uncle Jamieâ€™s idea,â€ he said, with as much an air of casual dismissal as could be assumed on short notice. He lifted one shoulder. â€œTo give the bairn a name, aye? I said I would, for the family honor.â€

â€œThe family honor,â€ she repeated, giving him a fishy look. â€œTo be sure. But thenâ€”â€

â€œBut then we found it was Roger Macâ€”heâ€™d taken back his own name of MacKenzie, is why we didna recognize himâ€”that weâ€™d given to the Indians by mistake, and so we went to retrieve him,â€ he said quickly. By the time heâ€™d finished explaining all the events that had culminated in his volunteering to take the place of a Mohawk killed during Rogerâ€™s rescue, the washing of his body in the river, the Mohawk women scrubbing him with sand to remove the last trace of his white blood, the plucking of his hair and the tattoos, he thought his marriage to Emily might seem only one more picturesque detail.

But of course it didnâ€™t.

â€œIâ€”â€ He stopped dead, realizing suddenly that the conversation was about to become even stickier than heâ€™d thought. He glanced at her apprehensively, heart beating in his throat and ears. But she was still looking back; the pinkness round her mouth showing more vividly because sheâ€™d gone a little paleâ€”but looking, clear and steady.

â€œIâ€”wasna a virgin when I wed,â€ he blurted.

The eyebrow went up again.

â€œReally, I am not quite sure what to ask,â€ she said, examining him in the way heâ€™d seen his auntie Claire appraise some horrible growthâ€”fascinated rather than repelled, but with a firm air of deciding exactly how best to deal with the offending bit. He hoped fervently she didnâ€™t mean to cut him out of her life like a wart or amputate him like a gangrenous toe.

â€œIâ€™ll . . . tell ye anything ye want to know,â€ he said bravely. â€œAnything.â€

â€œA generous offer,â€ she said, â€œand one I shall acceptâ€”but I think I must offer thee the same accommodation. Thee does not wish to ask whether I am virgin?â€

His mouth fell open, and her shoulders shook briefly.

â€œYeâ€™re not?â€ he croaked.

â€œNo, I am,â€ she assured him, still quivering with the effort not to laugh. â€œBut why should thee assume it?â€

â€œWhy?â€ He felt the blood rise in his face. â€œBecauseâ€”anyone who looked at ye would know ye on the instant for aâ€”aâ€”a virtuous woman!â€ he concluded, with a sense of relief at having found a reasonable term.

â€œI might have been raped,â€ she pointed out. â€œThat would not mean I was not virtuous, would it?â€

â€œIâ€”well. No, I suppose not.â€ He knew that a good many folk would think a raped woman was not virtuousâ€”and Rachel knew that. He was on the verge of becoming completely confused, and she knew that, too; he could see her taking pains not to laugh. He squared his shoulders and gave a great sigh, then met her eyes directly.

â€œDâ€™ye want to hear about every woman whose bed Iâ€™ve shared? Because Iâ€™ll tell ye, if so. Iâ€™ve never taken a woman unwillingâ€”though they were mostly whores. Iâ€™m no poxed, though,â€ he assured her. â€œYe should ken that.â€

She considered that for a moment.

â€œI think I need not know the details,â€ she said finally. â€œBut should we ever meet a woman thee has bedded, I wish to know it. Thee does not mean to continue fornicating with prostitutes once we are wed, though, does thee?â€

â€œNo!â€

â€œGood,â€ she said, but rocked back a little on the log, hands linked around her knees, holding his gaze. â€œI do wish to hear more about thy wife. Emily.â€

He could feel the warmth of her leg, her body, close beside him. She hadnâ€™t moved away from him when heâ€™d said about sleeping with whores. The silence grew around them, and a jay called somewhere in the wood beyond.

â€œWe loved each other,â€ he said at last, softly, eyes on the ground. â€œAnd I wanted her. Iâ€”could talk to her. Then, at least.â€

Rachel drew breath but didnâ€™t say anything. He took his courage in his hands and looked up. Her face was carefully expressionless, her eyes intent on his face.

â€œI dinna ken how to say it,â€ he said. â€œIt wasna the same way I want youâ€”but I dinna mean to make it sound as though . . . as though Emily didna matter to me. She did,â€ he added, very low-voiced, and glanced down again.

â€œAnd . . . she does?â€ Rachel asked quietly, after a long pause. After a longer one, he nodded, swallowing.

â€œBut,â€ he said, and stopped, searching for the way to go on, because now they were coming to the most perilous part of his confession, the thing that might make Rachel stand up and walk away, dragging his heart behind her through the rocks and brush.

â€œBut?â€ she said, and her voice was gentle.

â€œThe Mohawk,â€ he began, and had to stop for a breath. â€œItâ€™s the womanâ€™s choice, about being married. If a woman should take against her husband for some reasonâ€”if he beats her, or heâ€™s a lazy sot, or smells too bad when he fartsâ€â€”he stole a glance and saw the corner of her mouth twitch, which heartened him a littleâ€”â€œshe puts his things out oâ€™ the longhouse, and he has to go back to live wiâ€™ the unmarried menâ€”or find another woman whoâ€™ll have him at her fire. Or leave altogether.â€

â€œAnd Emily put you out?â€ She sounded both startled and a bit indignant. He gave her a wee smile in return.

â€œAye, she did. Not because I beat her, though. Because . . . of the bairns.â€

He felt the tears come to his eyes and clenched his hands in frustration on his knees. Damn, heâ€™d sworn to himself that he wouldnâ€™t weep. Either sheâ€™d think he made a show of his grief to win her sympathyâ€”or sheâ€™d see too deep; he wasnâ€™t ready . . . but he had to tell her, heâ€™d started this on purpose to tell her, she had to know. . . .

â€œI couldna give her children,â€ he blurted. â€œThe firstâ€”we had a wee daughter, born too early, who died. I called her IseabaÃ¬l.â€ He wiped the back of his hand viciously under his nose, swallowing his pain. â€œAfter that, sheâ€”Emilyâ€”she got wiâ€™ child again. And again. And when she lost the third . . . her heart toward me died with it.â€

Rachel made a small sound, but he didnâ€™t look at her. Couldnâ€™t. Just sat hunched on the log like a toadstool, shoulders drawn up around his ears, and eyes blurred with the tears he couldnâ€™t shed.

A small warm hand settled on his.

â€œAnd your heart?â€ she asked. â€œYours died, too?â€

He closed his hand on hers and nodded. And then just breathed for a bit, holding on to her hand, until he could speak again without his voice breaking.

â€œThe Mohawk think that the manâ€™s spirit fights wiâ€™ the womanâ€™s, when they . . . lie together. And she willna get with child unless his spirit can conquer hers.â€

â€œOh, I see,â€ Rachel said softly. â€œSo she blamed you.â€

He shrugged.

â€œI canna say she was wrong.â€ He turned a little on the log, to look at her directly. â€œAnd I canna say that it would be differentâ€”with us. But I did ask Auntie Claire, and she told me about things in the blood . . . well, perhaps ye should ask her to explain it; I wouldna make a decent job of it. But the end of it was that she thought it might be different wiâ€™ another woman. That I maybe could. Give ye bairns, I mean.â€

He only realized that Rachel had been holding her breath when she let it out, a sigh that brushed his cheek.

â€œDo yeâ€”â€ he began, but she had risen a little, into him, and she kissed him gently on the mouth, then held his head against her breast and took the end of her kerchief and wiped his eyes and then her own.

â€œOh, Ian,â€ she whispered. â€œI do love thee.â€





FREEDOM!

GREY PASSED ANOTHER interminableâ€”though less eventfulâ€”day, broken only by watching Colonel Smith write dispatches, which he did at a furious rate, quill scratching with the sound of a scuttling cockroach. This bit of imagery did nothing for Greyâ€™s digestion, which, in the aftermath of intoxication, hadnâ€™t dealt all that well with the cold grease-caked journeycake and burnt-acorn coffee heâ€™d been given for breakfast.

In spite of physical infelicity and an uncertain future, though, he found himself surprisingly cheerful. Jamie Fraser was alive, and he, John, wasnâ€™t married. Given those two marvelous facts, the dubious prospects of escape and the much higher probability of being hanged seemed only mildly concerning. He settled himself to wait with what grace he could, sleeping as much as his head allowed, or singing softly to himselfâ€”a practice that caused Smith to hunch his shoulders up around his ears and scratch faster.

Messengers came and went with great frequency. If he hadnâ€™t already known that the Continentals were not only moving but preparing for a fight, it would have been clear to him within an hour. The hot air was burdened with the scent of molten lead and the whine of a sharpening wheel, and the camp had a sense of rising urgency that any soldier would have felt at once.

Smith made no attempt to keep him from hearing what was said by and to the messengers and subalterns; clearly he didnâ€™t expect the information gained to be of any use to Grey. Well . . . neither did Grey, to be honest.

Toward the evening, the tentâ€™s door was darkened by a slender female form, though, and Grey raised himself to a sitting position, careful of his tender head, because his heart had begun to beat strongly again and it made his eye throb.

His niece Dottie was in sober Quaker garb, but the soft blue of much-laundered indigo was surprisingly flattering to her English-rose coloringâ€”and she was in amazing fine looks. She nodded to Colonel Smith and set down her tray upon his desk, before glancing over his shoulder at the prisoner. Her blue eyes widened in shock, and Grey grinned at her over the colonelâ€™s shoulder. Denzell must have warned her, but he supposed he must look a literal fright, with a grotesquely swollen face and a fixed and glaring crimson eye.

She blinked and swallowed, then said something low-voiced to Smith, with a brief questioning gesture in Greyâ€™s direction. He nodded impatiently, already taking up his own spoon, and she wrapped a thick rag around one of the steaming cans on the tray and came across to Greyâ€™s cot.

â€œDear me, Friend,â€ she said mildly. â€œThee seems much injured. Dr. Hunter says thee may eat as much as is comfortable, and he will attend thee later to put a dressing on your eye.â€

â€œThank you, young woman,â€ he said gravely, and, glancing over her shoulder to be sure Smithâ€™s back was turned, nodded at her. â€œIs it squirrel stew?â€

â€œPossum, Friend,â€ she said. â€œHere, I brought thee a spoon. The stew is boiling; be careful.â€ Putting herself carefully between him and Smith, she placed the rag-wrapped can between his knees and rapidly touched the rags, then the links of his fetters, her eyebrows raised. A horn spoon was produced from the pocket tied at her waistâ€”and a knife with it, which was slipped under his pillow, quick as any conjurer could have managed it.

Her pulse was beating fast in her throat, and perspiration gleamed at her temples. He touched her hand once, softly, and picked up the spoon.

â€œThank you,â€ he said again. â€œTell Dr. Hunter I look forward to seeing him again.â€





THE ROPE WAS horsehair and the knife dull, and it was very late and with innumerable small cuts stinging his hands and fingers that Grey rose cautiously from the cot. His heart was pounding; he could feel it thumping briskly behind his injured eye and hoped the eye itself was not going to explode under the impact.

He bent and picked up the tin chamber pot and used it; Smith was a very sound sleeper, thank God; if he roused at all, he would hear the familiar noise, be reassured, andâ€”presumablyâ€”fall back asleep, subconsciously ignoring any further small noises as being Grey resettling himself.

Smithâ€™s breathing didnâ€™t change. He had a small, buzzing snore like a bee working in a flower, a tidy, busy sound that Grey found mildly comical. He lowered himself to his knees, slowly, between the cot and Smithâ€™s pallet, fighting a momentary insane impulse to kiss Smith on the earâ€”he had sweet, small ears, very pink. This vanished in an instant, and he crept on hands and knees to the edge of the tent. Heâ€™d threaded the rags and the gauze with which Denzell Hunter had packed his eye through the links of his fetters but still moved with the utmost caution. Being caught would be bad for him; it would be disastrous for Hunter and Dottie.

Heâ€™d been listening intently to the sentries for hours. There were two guarding the colonelâ€™s tent, but he was fairly sure that both were presently near the front flap, warming themselves at the fire; hot as the day had been, this late at night the forestâ€™s blood ran cold. So did his.

He lay down and squirmed as quickly as he could under the edge of the tent, clinging to the canvas to minimize any shaking of the tent itselfâ€”though heâ€™d taken pains to jerk on his rope every so often through the evening, so that any shifting of the structure might be put down to his normal movements.

Out! He allowed himself one deep gulp of airâ€”fresh, cold, and leafyâ€”then rose, clutching the padded fetters close against his body, and walked as silently as possible away from the tent. He mustnâ€™t run.

He had had a short, sharp, whispered argument with Hunter during the latterâ€™s evening visit, seizing the brief moment when Smith had left the tent to visit the latrine. Hunter had insisted that Grey hide in his wagon; he was going into Philadelphia, everyone knew that, there would be no suspicion, and Grey would be safe from patrols. Grey appreciated Hunterâ€™s desire to rescue him, but he couldnâ€™t possibly put the doctorâ€”let alone Dottieâ€”at risk, and risk it would be. In Smithâ€™s place, the first thing he would do was prevent anyone from leaving, the second, search the camp and everything in it.

â€œThereâ€™s no time,â€ Hunter had said, briskly tucking in the end of the bandage he had wrapped around Greyâ€™s head, â€œand thee may be right.â€ He glanced over his shoulder; Smith would be back any minute. â€œIâ€™ll leave a bundle of food and clothing in my wagon for thee. If thee chooses to make use of it, Iâ€™m glad. If not, God go with thee!â€

â€œWait!â€ Grey seized Hunter by the sleeve, making his fetters rattle. â€œHow will I know which wagon is yours?â€

â€œOh.â€ Hunter coughed, seeming embarrassed. â€œIt . . . has a, um, sign painted on the tailboard. Dottie purchased it fromâ€”Now, you must take care, Friend,â€ he said, abruptly raising his voice. â€œEat generously but slowly, take no alcohol, and be careful in moving. Do not stand up too quickly.â€

Colonel Smith came in and, seeing the doctor present, came over to inspect the patient himself.

â€œAre you feeling better, Colonel?â€ he inquired politely. â€œOr are you still suffering from the need to burst into song? If so, might I suggest you do so now and get it out of your system, before I retire for the night?â€

Hunterâ€”who had of course heard â€œDie Sommernachtâ€ the night beforeâ€”made a small noise in his throat but managed to take his leave without losing control.

Grey grinned to himself, recalling Smithâ€™s glowerâ€”and imagining what the colonel might look like in a few hours, when he woke to discover that his songbird had flown. He made his way around the edge of the camp, avoiding the picket lines of mules and horsesâ€”easy to detect by the smell of manure. The wagons were parked nearby: no artillery, he noted.

The sky was overcast, a sickle moon glimmering uneasily between racing clouds, and the air held the scent of impending rain. Fine. There were worse things than being wet and cold, and rain would hamper pursuit, if anyone discovered his absence before daylight.

No abnormal sounds from the camp behind him; none he could hear above the noise of his own heart and breathing. Hunterâ€™s wagon was easy to find, even in the flickering dark. Heâ€™d thought by â€œsignâ€ that the doctor meant a name, but it was one of the barn signs that some of the German immigrants painted on their houses and sheds. He smiled when the clouds parted, revealing this one clearly, and he saw why Dottie had chosen it: it was a large circle, in which two comical birds faced each other, beaks open in the manner of lovebirds. Distlefink. The word floated into his head; someone, somewhere, had told him the name of that sort of bird, saying it was a symbol of good luck.

â€œGood,â€ he said under his breath, climbing up into the wagon. â€œIâ€™ll need it.â€

He found the bundle under the seat, where Hunter had told him, and took a moment to remove the silver buckles from his shoes, tying the flaps together instead with a length of leather lacing that had evidently been meant for his hair. He left the buckles tucked under the seat, put on the shabby coat, which smelled strongly of stale beer and what he thought was old blood, and peered at the knitted cap, which held two journeycakes, an apple, and a small canteen of water. Turning back the edge of the hat, he read by the fitful moonlight, LIBERTY OR DEATH, in bold white letters.



HE WASNâ€™T HEADED in any particular direction; even had the sky been clear, he wasnâ€™t sufficiently familiar as to be able to chart his direction by the stars. His only goal was to get as far away from Smith as possible, without running into another militia company or a patrol of Continentals. Once the sun was up, he could orient himself; Hunter had told him that the main road lay southâ€“southwest of the camp, about four miles away.

What the public might make of a man strolling down the main road in fetters was another question, but not one he needed to answer just now. After walking for an hour or so, he found a sheltered spot among the roots of an enormous pine tree and, taking out the knife, hacked off his hair as best he could. He stuffed the shorn locks well back under a root, rubbed his hands in the dirt, and then applied them vigorously to hair and face before donning his Phrygian cap.

Thus suitably concealed, he heaped a thick blanket of fallen dry needles over himself, curled up, and went to sleep to the sound of pattering rain in the trees above, once more a free man.





NAMELESS, HOMELESS, DESTITUTE, AND VERY DRUNK INDEED

HOT, DISHEVELED, AND still thoroughly out of temper from his encounter with Richardson, William made his way back through the crowded streets. One more night in a decent bed, at least. Tomorrow heâ€™d leave Philadelphia with the last few companies of the army, following Clinton northâ€”and leaving the remaining Loyalists to fend for themselves. He was torn between relief and guilt at the thought but had little energy left to consider them.

He arrived at his billet to find that his orderly had deserted and had taken with him Williamâ€™s best coat, two pairs of silk stockings, a half bottle of brandy, and the seed-pearl-encrusted double miniature of Williamâ€™s mother, Geneva, and his other mother, her sister, Isobel.

This was so far over the bloody limit of what could be borne that he didnâ€™t even swear, merely sank down on the edge of the bed, closed his eyes, and breathed through clenched teeth until the pain in his stomach subsided. It left a raw-edged hollow. Heâ€™d had that miniature since he was born, was accustomed to bid it good night before he slept, though since heâ€™d left home he did this silently.

He told himself it didnâ€™t matter; he was unlikely to forget what his mothers looked likeâ€”there were other paintings, at home at Helwater. He remembered Mama Isobel. And he could see the traces of his real mother in his own face. . . . Involuntarily, he glanced at the shaving mirror that hung on the wallâ€”the orderly had somehow overlooked that in his flightâ€”and felt the hollow inside him fill with hot tar. He no longer saw the curve of his motherâ€™s mouth, her dark wavy chestnut hair; he saw instead the too-long, knife-edged nose, the slanted eyes and broad cheekbones.

He stared at this blunt evidence of betrayal for an instant, then turned and stamped out.

â€œFuck the resemblance!â€ he said, and slammed the door behind him.

He didnâ€™t care where he was going, but within a few streets he ran into Lindsay and another couple of fellows he knew, all intent on making the most of their last evening in a semi-civilized city.

â€œCome along, young Ellesmere,â€ Sandy said, collaring him firmly and shoving him down the street. â€œLetâ€™s make a few memories to see us through the long winter nights up north, eh?â€

Some hours later, viewing the world through the bottom of a beer glass, William wondered rather blearily whether memories counted if you didnâ€™t remember them. Heâ€™d lost count some time ago of whatâ€”and how many of whatâ€”heâ€™d drunk. He thought heâ€™d lost one or two or three of the companions with whom heâ€™d started the evening, too, but couldnâ€™t swear to it.

Sandy was still there, swaying in front of him, saying something, urging him to his feet. William smiled vaguely at the barmaid, fumbled in his pocket, and laid his last coin on the table. That was all right, he had more in his trunk, rolled up in his spare pair of stockings.

He followed Sandy outside into a night that seized and clung, the hot air so thick that it was hard to breathe, clogged with the smell of horse droppings, human ordure, fish scales, wilted vegetables, and fresh-slaughtered meat. It was late, and dark; the moon had not yet risen, and he stumbled over the cobbles, lurching into Sandy, a blacker smudge on the night before him.

Then there was a door, a blur of light, and an enveloping hot scent of liquor and womenâ€”their flesh, their perfume, the smell more befuddling than the sudden light. A woman in a ribboned cap was smiling at him, greeting him, too old to be a whore. He nodded amiably at her and opened his mouth, only to be mildly surprised by the fact that heâ€™d forgotten how to talk. He closed his mouth and went on nodding; the woman laughed in a practiced way and guided him to a shabby wing chair, where she deposited him as she might leave a parcel to be called for later.

He sat slumped in a daze for some time, the sweat running down his neck under his stock and dampening his shirt. There was a fire burning in a hearth near his legs, a small cauldron of rum punch steaming on the hob, and the scent of it made him queasy. He had the feeling that he was melting like a candle but couldnâ€™t move without being sick. He shut his eyes.

Some time later, he slowly became aware of voices near him. He listened for a little, unable to make sense of any words but feeling the flow vaguely soothing, like ocean waves. His stomach had settled now, and with his eyelids at half-mast, he gazed placidly at a shifting sand of light and shadow, pricked with bright colors, like darting tropical birds.

He blinked a few times, and the colors shimmered into coherence: the hair and ribbons and white shifts of women, the red coats of infantry, the blue of an artilleryman moving among them. Their voices had given him the impression of birds, high and trilling, squawking now and then, or scolding like the mockingbirds who lived in the big oak near the plantation house at Mount Josiah. But it wasnâ€™t the womenâ€™s voices that caught his attention.

A pair of dragoons were lounging on the settee nearby, drinking rum punch and eyeing up the women. He thought theyâ€™d been talking for some time, but now he could make out the words.

â€œEver buggered a girl?â€ one of the dragoons was saying to his friend. The friend giggled and flushed, shook his head, murmured something that sounded like, â€œToo dear for my purse.â€

â€œWhat you wantâ€™s a girl that hates it.â€ The dragoon hadnâ€™t moved his gaze from the women across the room. He raised his voice, just a little. â€œThey clamp down, trying to get rid of you. But they canâ€™t.â€

William turned his head and looked at the man, repulsed, and making his disgust evident. The man ignored him. He seemed vaguely familiar, dark and heavy-featured, but no one William knew by name.

â€œThen you take her hand and make her reach back and feel you. God, the squirmingâ€”milk you like a dairymaid, she will!â€ The man laughed loudly, still staring across the room, and for the first time William looked to see the target of this brutish farrago. There were three women standing in a group, two in their shifts, the thin fabric molded damply to their bodies, one in an embroidered petticoat, but it was plain to see who the dragoonâ€™s insinuations were meant for: the tallish one in the petticoat, who stood there with her fists clenched, glaring back at the dragoon fit to burn a hole through his forehead.

The madam was standing a little apart, frowning at the dragoon. Sandy had disappeared. The other men present were drinking and talking with four girls at the far end of the room; they hadnâ€™t heard this vulgar impertinence. The dragoonâ€™s friend was scarlet as his coat, between liquor, amusement, and embarrassment.

The dark dragoon was flushed, too, a livid line across his heavy stubbled jowls where they pressed against the leather of his stock. One hand plucked absently at the sweat-stained crotch of his moleskin breeches. He was having too much fun with his prey to cut the chase short, though.

â€œMind, you donâ€™t want one whoâ€™s used to it. You want her tight.â€ He leaned forward a little, elbows on his knees, eyes intent on the tall girl. â€œBut you donâ€™t want one whoâ€™s never had it before, either. Better if she knows whatâ€™s coming, eh?â€

His friend mumbled something indistinct, glanced at the girl and hastily away. William looked back at the girl, too, and as she made a small involuntary movementâ€”not quite a flinchâ€”the candlelight glowed for an instant on the smooth crown of her head: soft chestnut, with the gloss of a fresh conker. Jesus Christ.

Before he knew it, he was on his feet. He took two swaying paces to the madamâ€™s side, touched her shoulder politely, and when she turned a surprised face up to himâ€”all her attention had been on the dragoon, a worried line between her browsâ€”he said slowly, so as not to slur his words, â€œIâ€™ll take that one, please. Theâ€”the tall girl. In the petticoat. For the night.â€

The madamâ€™s plucked eyebrows all but vanished into her cap. She looked quickly at the dragoon, who was still so fixed on his prey that he hadnâ€™t noticed William at all. His friend had, though; he nudged the dragoon and muttered in his ear.

â€œEh? Whatâ€™s that?â€ The man was already moving, scrambling to his feet. William groped hastily in his pocket, remembering too late that he was penniless.

â€œWhatâ€™s this, Madge?â€ The dragoon was with them, dividing a glower between the madam and William. William straightened instinctivelyâ€”he had six inches on the manâ€”and squared up. The dragoon assessed his size and his age and lifted the corner of his upper lip to show an eyetooth. â€œArabellaâ€™s mine, sir. Iâ€™m sure Madge will find another young lady to accommodate you.â€

â€œI am before you, sir,â€ William said, and bowed, inclining his head a quarter inch, keeping a close eye on the cullion. Wouldnâ€™t put it past the filthy bugger to try to kick him in the ballsâ€”the look on his face, he wouldnâ€™t stick at it.

â€œHe is, Captain Harkness,â€ the madam said quickly, stepping between the men. â€œHeâ€™s already offered for the girl, and as you hadnâ€™t made up your mind . . .â€ She wasnâ€™t looking at Harkness; she jerked her chin urgently at one of the girls, who looked alarmed but swiftly vanished through a door at the back. Gone to fetch Ned, William thought automatically, and wondered dimly for an instant how he knew the doorkeeperâ€™s name.

â€œHavenâ€™t seen the color of his money yet, have you?â€ Harkness reached into his bosom and pulled out a well-stuffed wallet, from which he withdrew a careless sheaf of paper money. â€œIâ€™ll have her.â€ He grinned unpleasantly at William. â€œFor the night.â€

William promptly whipped off his silver gorget, took the madamâ€™s hand, and pressed the crescent into it.

â€œFor the night,â€ he repeated politely, and without further ado turned and walked across the room, though the floor seemed to undulate slightly beneath his feet. He took Arabellaâ€”Arabella?â€”by the arm and steered her toward the back door. She looked appalledâ€”plainly she recognized himâ€”but a quick glance at Captain Harkness decided her that William was the lesser of two weevils, as heâ€™d heard a sailor friend of his fatherâ€™s put it.

He could hear Harknessâ€™s shout behind them, but just then the door opened and a very large, tough-looking man walked in. He had but one eye, but that one focused instantly on Harkness. The man advanced on the captain, walking lightly on the balls of his feet, fists half curled. Ex-boxer, William thought, pleased. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Harkness!

Then, a hand on the stairwell wall to stop from stumbling, he found himself following a round, agitated bum up the same worn, lye-soap-smelling stairs he had trodden yesterday, wondering what the devil heâ€™d say to her when he reached the top.



HEâ€™D BEEN VAGUELY hoping that it wouldnâ€™t be the same room, but it was. It was night now, though, and the windows were open. The warmth of the day lingered in the walls and floor, but there was a breeze, spicy with tree sap and the riverâ€™s breath, that made the single candle flame flicker and bend. The girl waited for him to come in, then closed the door and stood with her back against it, her hand still on the knob.

â€œI wonâ€™t hurt you,â€ he blurted. â€œI didnâ€™t mean to, last time.â€ Her hand relaxed a bit, though she continued to look narrowly at him. It was dark where she stood, and he could barely make out the gleam of her eyes. She didnâ€™t look friendly.

â€œYou didnâ€™t hurt me,â€ she said. â€œYou spoilt my best petticoat, though, and a decanter of wine. Cost me a beating and a weekâ€™s wages, that.â€

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ he said. â€œTruly. Iâ€™llâ€”Iâ€™ll pay for the wine and the petticoat.â€ Using what? he wondered. It had belatedly occurred to him that the spare stockings in which he kept his cash had vanished with his orderly, and undoubtedly so had the cash. Well, heâ€™d pawn something if he had to, or borrow a bit. â€œCanâ€™t do much about the beating. But I am sorry.â€

She made a small huffing noise through her nose but seemed to accept this. She took her hand off the doorknob and came a little way into the room, so he could see her face in the candlelight. She was very pretty, despite the look of suspicious wariness, and he felt a mild stirring.

â€œWell.â€ She looked him up and down, much as sheâ€™d done when she met him in the alley. â€œWilliam, you said your name is?â€

â€œYes.â€ The silence lengthened a heartbeat past comfort, and he asked, almost at random, â€œIs your name really Arabella?â€

That surprised her, and her mouth twitched, though she didnâ€™t laugh.

â€œNo. Iâ€™m a fancy piece, though, and Madge thinks the fancies should have names likeâ€”likeâ€”ladies?â€ She raised a brow, and he wasnâ€™t sure whether she was questioning whether ladies had names like Arabella or what he thought of Madgeâ€™s philosophy.

â€œI do know a couple of Arabellas,â€ he offered. â€œOne of themâ€™s six and the otherâ€™s eighty-two.â€

â€œAre they ladies?â€ She waved a hand, dismissing the question as soon as it was asked. â€œOf course they are. You wouldnâ€™t know them, otherwise. Do you want me to send for wine? Or punch?â€ She gave him an assessing eye. â€œOnly, if you want to do anything, I really think youâ€™d best stay off the drink. Your choice, though.â€ She put a hand to the tie of her petticoat in tepid invitation but didnâ€™t pull it loose. Clearly, she wasnâ€™t keen to induce him to â€œdo anything.â€

He rubbed a hand over his sweating face, imagined he smelled the alcohol oozing from his pores, and wiped it on his breeches.

â€œI donâ€™t want wine, no. Nor do I want to . . . to do . . . well, thatâ€™s not true,â€ he admitted. â€œI do want toâ€”very much,â€ he added hurriedly, lest she think him insulting, â€œbut Iâ€™m not going to.â€

She looked at him openmouthed.

â€œWhy not?â€ she said at last. â€œYouâ€™ve paid well over the odds for anything you want to do. Including buggery, if thatâ€™s your pleasure.â€ Her lip curled a little.

He flushed to the scalp.

â€œYou think I would save you fromâ€”that, and then do it myself?â€



â€œYes. Often men donâ€™t think of something until another mentions it, and then theyâ€™re all eagerness to try it themselves.â€

He was outraged.

â€œYou must have a most indifferent opinion of gentlemen, madam!â€

Her mouth twitched again, and she gave him a look of such barely veiled amusement that the blood burned in his face and ears.

â€œRight,â€ he said stiffly. â€œI take your point.â€

â€œWell, thatâ€™s a novelty,â€ she said, the twitch breaking into a malicious smile. â€œItâ€™s generally the other way round.â€

He breathed deeply through his nose.

â€œI . . . it is meant as an apology, if you like.â€ It was a struggle to keep meeting her eye. â€œFor what happened last time.â€

A faint breeze came in, ruffling the hair about her shoulders and filling the fabric of her shift so it billowed, which afforded him a glimpse of her nipple, like a dark rose in the candlelight. He swallowed and looked away.

â€œMy . . . um . . . my stepfather . . . told me once that a madam of his acquaintance said to him that a nightâ€™s sleep was the best gift you could give a whore.â€

â€œIt runs in the family, does it? Frequenting brothels?â€ She didnâ€™t pause for a response to that. â€œHeâ€™s right, though. Do you really mean that you intend for me to . . . sleep?â€ From her tone of incredulity, he might have asked her to engage in some perversion well past buggery.

He kept his temper with some difficulty.

â€œYou can sing songs or stand on your head, if you prefer, madam,â€ he said. â€œI donâ€™t propose to . . . er . . . molest you. Beyond that, your actions are quite up to you.â€

She stared at him, a small frown between her brows, and he could see that she didnâ€™t believe him.

â€œI . . . would go,â€ he said, feeling awkward again, â€œbut I have some concern that Captain Harkness might be still on the premises, and should he learn that you are alone . . .â€ And he somehow couldnâ€™t face his own dark, empty room. Not tonight.

â€œI imagine Nedâ€™s disposed of him,â€ she said, then cleared her throat. â€œBut donâ€™t go. If you do, Madge will send somebody else up.â€ She took off her petticoat, with no display of coquetry or artifice in the motion. There was a screen in the corner; she went behind this, and he heard the splash of her using a chamber pot.

She came out, glanced at him, and with a brief wave at the screen said, â€œJust there. If youâ€”â€

â€œUh . . . thank you.â€ He did in fact need to piss fairly badly, but the thought of using her pot, so soon after her own use of it, caused him an unreasonable amount of embarrassment. â€œIâ€™ll be fine.â€ He looked round, found a chair, and sat down in it, ostentatiously thrusting out his boots and leaning back in an attitude of relaxation. He closed his eyesâ€”mostly.

Through slitted lids, he saw her observe him closely for a moment, then she leaned over and blew out the candle. Ghostlike in the darkness, she climbed into her bedâ€”the ropes creaked with her weightâ€”and drew up the quilt. A faint sigh came to him over the sounds of the brothel below.



â€œEr . . . Arabella?â€ He didnâ€™t expect thanks, exactly, but he did want something from her.

â€œWhat?â€ She sounded resigned, obviously expecting him to say that heâ€™d changed his mind about buggery.

â€œWhatâ€™s your real name?â€

There was silence for a minute, as she made up her mind. There was nothing tentative about the young woman, though, and when she did reply, it was without reluctance.

â€œJane.â€

â€œOh. Justâ€”the one thing more. My coatâ€”â€

â€œI sold it.â€

â€œOh. Er . . . good night, then.â€

There was a prolonged moment, filled with the unspoken thoughts of two people, then a deep, exasperated sigh.

â€œCome and get into bed, you idiot.â€



HE COULDNâ€™T GET into bed in full uniform. He did keep his shirt on, with some idea of preserving her modesty and his original intent. He lay quite rigid beside her, trying to envision himself as the tomb figure of a Crusader: a marble monument to noble behavior, sworn to a chastity enforced by his stone embodiment.

Unfortunately, it was a rather small bed and William was rather large. And Arabellaâ€“Jane wasnâ€™t trying at all to avoid touching him. Granted, she wasnâ€™t trying to arouse him, either, but her mere presence did that without half trying.

He was intensely aware of every inch of his body and which of them were in contact with hers. He could smell her hair, a faint scent of soap mingled with the sweetness of tobacco smoke. Her breath was sweet, too, with the smell of burnt rum, and he wanted to taste it in her mouth, share the lingering stickiness. He closed his eyes and swallowed.

Only the fact that he needed desperately to pee made it possible to keep his hands off her. He was in that state of drunkenness where he could perceive a problem but could not analyze a solution to it, and sheer inability to think of two things at once prevented him either speaking to her or laying a hand on hers.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ she whispered hoarsely. â€œYouâ€™re wiggling like youâ€™ve got tadpoles in your drawersâ€”only you havenâ€™t any drawers on, have you?â€ She giggled, and her breath tickled his ear. He groaned softly.

â€œHere, nowâ€”â€ Her voice took on a tone of alarm, and she sat up in bed, twisting round to look at him. â€œYouâ€™re not going to be sick in my bed! Get up! Get up right this minute!â€ She pushed at him with small, urgent hands, and he stumbled out of bed, swaying and clutching at furniture to keep from falling.

The window gaped before him, open to the night, a lovely sickle moon pale above. Taking this as the celestial invitation it surely was, he raised his shirt, gripped the window frame, and pissed into the night in a majestically arching rush of blinding bliss.



The sense of relief was so intense that he noticed nothing whatever in its wake, until Arabellaâ€“Jane seized him by the arm and pulled him away from the window.

â€œGet out of sight, for Godâ€™s sake!â€ She risked a hasty glance downward, then dodged back, shaking her head. â€œOh, well. Itâ€™s not as though Captain Harkness was ever going to propose you for membership in his favorite club, is it?â€

â€œHarkness?â€ William swayed toward the window, blinking. There was a remarkable amount of shouting and abuse coming from below, but he was having trouble in focusing his eyes and perceived nothing save the flicker of red uniforms, redder still in the light from the lantern over the establishmentâ€™s door.

â€œNever mind. Heâ€™ll likely think I did it,â€ Arabellaâ€“Jane said, a dark note in her voice.

â€œYouâ€™re a girl,â€ William pointed out logically. â€œYou couldnâ€™t piss out a window.â€

â€œNot without making a prime spectacle of myself, no,â€ she agreed. â€œBut â€™tisnâ€™t unknown for a whore to throw the contents of her chamber pot out on someone, accidental on purpose. Well.â€ She shrugged, went behind the screen, and emerged with the aforementioned receptacle, which she promptly upended out the open window. In response to renewed howls from below, she leaned out and shrieked several insults that a regimental sergeant would have been proud to author, before ducking back in and banging the shutters closed.

â€œMay as well be hangedâ€”or buggeredâ€”for a sheep as a lamb,â€ she remarked, taking him by the arm again. â€œCome back to bed.â€

â€œItâ€™s only in Scotland that they bugger sheep,â€ William said, obediently following her. â€œAnd maybe part of Yorkshire. Northumbria, too, maybe.â€

â€œOh, really? Is Captain Harkness from one of those places, then?â€

â€œOh, him?â€ William sat down on the bed rather suddenly, as the room had begun to revolve in a stately manner round him. â€œNo. Iâ€™d say maybe Devon, from hisâ€”his . . . speech,â€ he concluded, pleased to have found the word.

â€œSo theyâ€™ve got sheep in Devon, too, then, I suppose.â€ Arabellaâ€“Jane was unbuttoning his shirt. He raised a hand to stop her, wondered why he should, and left the hand hanging in midair.

â€œLot of sheep,â€ he said. â€œLot of sheep everywhere in England.â€

â€œGod save the Queen, then,â€ she murmured, intent on her work. The last button came free, and a faint draft of air stirred the hairs on Williamâ€™s chest.

He remembered then why he should have been stopping her, but sheâ€™d put her head inside the open front of his shirt and licked his nipple before he could make his arrested hand complete its motion, and when he did, it merely settled gently on her head, which was surprisingly warm. So was her breath. So was her hand, which had wrapped itself around his prick in a possessive sort of way.

â€œNo,â€ he said, after what seemed a very long time but could have been no more than seconds. His hand descended and closedâ€”regretfullyâ€”over hers where it grasped him. â€œI . . . I meant it. I wonâ€™t bother you.â€



She didnâ€™t let go but did sit up and regard him with an air of puzzled impatience, just visible in the lantern light that seeped through the shutters.

â€œIf you bother me, Iâ€™ll tell you to stop; howâ€™s that?â€ she offered.

â€œNo,â€ he repeated. He was concentrating fiercely now; it seemed exceedingly important that she understand. â€œHonor. Itâ€™s my honor.â€

She made a small sound that might have been impatience or amusement.

â€œMaybe you should have considered your honor before you came to a whorehouse. Or did someone drag you inside against your will?â€

â€œI came with a friend,â€ he said with dignity. She still hadnâ€™t let go but couldnâ€™t move her hand, not with his clasped tightly around it. â€œThatâ€™s . . . not what I mean. I mean . . .â€ The words that had come easily a moment before had slipped away again, leaving him blank.

â€œYou could tell me later, once youâ€™ve had a good think,â€ she suggested, and he was startled to discover that she had two hands and knew what to do with the other one, too.

â€œUnhand my . . .â€ Damn, what is the bloody word? â€œUnhand my testicles if you please, madam.â€

â€œJust as you like,â€ she replied crisply, and, doing so, put her head back inside his damp, smelly shirt, seized one nipple between her teeth, and sucked so hard that it pulled every last word out of his head.

Matters thereafter were unsettled but largely pleasant, though at one point he found himself rearing above her, sweat dripping from his face onto her breasts, muttering, â€œIâ€™m a bastard, Iâ€™m a bastard, Iâ€™m a bastard, donâ€™t you understand?â€

She didnâ€™t reply to this but stretched up a long white arm, cupped her hand round the back of his head, and pulled him down again.

â€œThatâ€™s why.â€ He came gradually to himself, aware that he was talking and evidently had been for some time, in spite of his head being cradled in the curve of her shoulder, his senses aswim in her musk (like a sweating flower, he thought dreamily), and her nipple a dark sweet thing an inch or two from his nose. â€œThe only honor I have left is my word. Have to keep it.â€ Then tears came suddenly to his eyes, with recollection of the moments just past. â€œWhy did you make me break my word?â€

She didnâ€™t answer for a while, and he would have thought sheâ€™d fallen asleep, save for the hand that roved over his bare back, gentle as a whisper.

â€œEver think that maybe a whore has a sense of honor, too?â€ she said at last.

Frankly, he hadnâ€™t, and opened his mouth to say so, but once more his words had gone missing. He closed his eyes and fell asleep on her breast.





DESPERATE MEASURES

SILVIA HARDMAN STOOD regarding Jamie with a lowered brow, her lips pushed out in concentration. Finally she shook her head, sighed, and drew herself up.

â€œThee means it, I suppose?â€

â€œI do, Friend Silvia. I must be in Philadelphia as quickly as may be. And to do that, I must reach the road. I must be able to walk tomorrow morning, however haltingly.â€

â€œWell, then. Patience, fetch me thy fatherâ€™s special flask. And, Prudence, will thee grind a good measure of mustard seed . . .â€ She stepped a little closer to the bed, peering nearsightedly at Jamieâ€™s back as though to gauge the acreage. â€œA good handfulâ€”no, make it two; thy hands are small.â€ She took a digging stick from the shelf near the door but hesitated before opening it. â€œDo not touch thy eyes or face, Pruâ€”and by no means touch Chastity without washing thy hands first. Let Patience mind her if she cries.â€

Chastity was making fretful noises, though freshly fed and changed. Patience, though, had already run out the door, making Jamie wonder where her fatherâ€™s special flask might be. Hidden, apparently.

â€œPut the wean beside me,â€ he suggested. â€œI can mind her for a bit.â€

Silvia did so without hesitation, which pleased him, and he lay face-to-face with wee Chastity, amusing them both by making faces at her. She giggledâ€”and so did Prudence, as the pestle scraped and the hot smell of ground mustard thickened the air. He stuck out his tongue and waggled it; Chastity shook like a small jelly and put out a tiny pink tongue tip in turn, which made him laugh.

â€œWhat are you all laughing at?â€ Patience demanded, opening the door. She frowned censoriously from one sister to the other, making them all laugh harder. When Mrs. Hardman came in a few moments later with a large grubby root in her hand, they had reached the point of laughing at absolutely nothing, and she blinked in bewilderment, but then shook her head and smiled.

â€œWell, they do say laughter is good medicine,â€ she remarked, when the hilarity had run its course, leaving the girls pink-faced and Jamie feeling slightly betterâ€”to his surprise. â€œMay I borrow thy knife, Friend James? It is more suited to the purpose than mine.â€

This was patently true; her knife was a crude iron blade, badly sharpened, the haft bound with string. Jamie had a good ivory case knife, bought in Brest, of hardened steel, with an edge that would shave the hairs off his forearm. He saw her smile with involuntary pleasure at the feel of it in her hand and had a momentary flash of memoryâ€”Brianna, delicately unfolding a blade of her Swiss Army knife, an air of pleased satisfaction on her face.

Claire appreciated good tools, too. But she touched tools with immediate thought of what she meant to do with them, rather than simple admiration for elegance and function. A blade in her hand was no longer a tool but an extension of her hand. His own hand closed, thumb rubbing gently against his fingertips, remembering the knife he had made for her, the handle carefully grooved and sanded smooth to fit her hand, to match her grip exactly. Then he closed his fist tight, not wanting to think of her so intimately. Not just now.

Bidding the girls stand well back out of the way, Silvia carefully peeled the root and grated it into a small wooden bowl, keeping her face averted as much as possible from the rising fumes of the fresh horseradish but still with tears streaming down her face. Then, wiping her eyes on her apron and taking up the â€œspecial flaskâ€â€”this being a dark-brown stoneware bottle stained with earth (had the lass just dug it up?)â€”she cautiously poured a small amount of the very alcoholic contents. What was it? Jamie wondered, sniffing cautiously. Very old applejack? Twice-fermented plum brandy? It had probably started life as some sort of fruit, but it had been some time since that fruit hung on a tree.

Mrs. Hardman relaxed, putting the cork back into the bottle as though relieved that the contents had not in fact exploded upon being decanted.

â€œWell, then,â€ she said, coming over to pick up Chastity, who squealed and fussed at being removed from Jamie, whom she plainly regarded as a large toy. â€œThat must steep for a few hours. Thee needs heat. Thee should sleep, if thee can. I know thee passed a wakeful night, and tonight may not be much better.â€



JAMIE HAD STEELED himself to the prospect of drinking horseradish liquor with a mix of trepidation and curiosity. The first of these emotions was momentarily relieved when he discovered that Mrs. Hardman didnâ€™t mean him to drink it, but it returned in force when he found himself a moment later facedown on the bed with his shirt rucked up to his oxters and his hostess vigorously rubbing the stuff into his buttocks.

â€œHave a care, Friend Silvia,â€ he managed, trying to turn his head enough to get his mouth clear of the pillow without either twisting his back or unclenching his bum. â€œIf ye drip that down the crack of my arse, I may be cured wiâ€™ a somewhat sudden violence.â€

A small snort of amusement tickled the hairs in the small of his back, where the flesh was still smarting and tingling from her administrations.

â€œMy grandmother did say this receipt would raise the dead,â€ she said, her voice pitched low in order not to disturb the girls, who were rolled up on the hearth in their blankets like caterpillars. â€œPerhaps she was less careful in her applications.â€





â€œTHEE NEEDS HEAT,â€ sheâ€™d said. Between the horseradish liniment and the mustard plaster resting on his lower back, he thought he might suffer spontaneous combustion at any moment. He was sure his skin was blistering. â€œI know thee passed a wakeful night, and tonight may not be much better.â€ Sheâ€™d got that right.

He shifted, trying to turn stealthily onto his side without making noise or dislodging the plasterâ€”sheâ€™d bound it to his lower back by means of strips of torn flannel tied round his body, but they had a tendency to slip. The pain when shifting was in fact much less, which encouraged him greatly. On the other hand, he felt as though someone was repeatedly passing a pine torch within inches of his body. And while she had been very careful while working the liniment into him from rib cage to knees, a bit of the ferocious liquid had touched his balls, giving him a not-unpleasant sense of remarkable heat between his legs but also an uncontrollable urge to squirm.

He hadnâ€™t, while she was working on him, and hadnâ€™t said a word. Not after seeing the state of her hands: red as a lobsterbackâ€™s coat, and a milky blister rising on the side of her thumb. She hadnâ€™t said a word, either, just drawn down his shirt when she was done and patted him gently on the backside before going to wash and then smooth a little cooking grease gingerly into her hands.

She was asleep now, too, a hunched form curled up in the corner of the settle, little Chastityâ€™s cradle by her foot, safely away from the banked embers of the fire. Now and then one of the glowing chunks of wood split with a loud crack! and a small fountain of sparks.

He stretched gingerly, experimenting. Better. But whether he was cured in the morning or not, he was leavingâ€”if he had to drag himself on his elbows to the road. The Hardmans must have their bed backâ€”and he must have his. Claireâ€™s bed.

The thought made the heat in his flesh bloom up through his belly, and he did squirm. His thoughts squirmed, too, thinking of her, and he grabbed one, pinning it down like a disobedient dog.

Itâ€™s nay her fault, he thought fiercely. Sheâ€™s done me nay wrong. Theyâ€™d thought him deadâ€”Marsali had told him so and told him that Lord John had wed Claire in haste following the news of Jamieâ€™s death, in order to protect not only her but Fergus and Marsali as well, from imminent arrest.

Aye, and then he took her to his bed! The knuckles of his left hand twinged as he curled his fist. â€œNever hit them in the face, lad.â€ Dougal had told him that a lifetime ago, as they watched a knockdown fight between two of Columâ€™s men in the courtyard at Leoch. â€œHit them in the soft parts.â€

Theyâ€™d hit him in the soft parts.

â€œNay her fault,â€ he muttered under his breath, turning restlessly into his pillow. What the bloody hell had happened, though? How had they done itâ€”why?

He felt as though he was fevered, his mind dazed with the waves of heat that throbbed over his body. And like the half-glimpsed things in fever dreams, he saw her naked flesh, pale and shimmering with sweat in the humid night, slick under John Greyâ€™s hand . . .

We were both fucking you!



His back felt as though someone had laid a hot girdle on it. With a deep growl of exasperation, he turned onto his side again and fumbled at the bandages holding the scalding plaster to his skin, at last wriggling out of its torrid embrace. He dropped it on the floor and flung back the quilt that covered him, seeking the relief of cool air on body and mind.

But the cabin was filled to the rooftree with the fuggy warmth of fire and sleeping bodies, and the heat that flamed over him seemed to have rooted itself between his legs. He clenched his fists in the bedclothes, trying not to writhe, trying to calm his mind.

â€œLord, let me stand aside from this,â€ he whispered in GÃ idhlig. â€œGrant me mercy and forgiveness. Grant me understanding!â€

What his mind presented him with instead was a fleeting sense, a memory of cold, as startling as it was refreshing. It was gone in a flash but left his hand tingling with the touch of cold stone, cool earth, and he clung to the memory, closing his eyes, in imagination pressing his hot cheek to the wall of the cave.

Because it was his cave. The place where heâ€™d hidden, where heâ€™d lived, in the years after Culloden. He had throbbed there, too, pulsing with heat and hurt, rage and fever, desolation and the sweet brief consolation of dreams wherein he met his wife again. And he felt in mind the coldness, the dark chill that heâ€™d thought would kill him, finding it now relief in the desert of his thoughts. He envisioned himself pressing his naked, scalded back to the rough damp of the cave wall, willing the coldness to pass into his flesh, to kill the fire.

His rigid body eased a little, and he breathed slower, stubbornly ignoring the ripe reeks of the cabin, the fumes of horseradish and plum brandy and mustard, of cooking and bodies washed infrequently. Trying to breathe the piercing cleanliness of the north wind, the scents of broom and heather.

And what he smelled was . . .

â€œMary,â€ he whispered, and his eyes flew open, shocked.

The scent of green onions and cherries, not quite ripe. A cold boiled fowl. And the warm smell of a womanâ€™s flesh, faintly acrid with the sweat in her clothes, overlaid by the mild, fatty smell of his sisterâ€™s lye soap.

He took a deep breath, as though he might capture more of it, but the cool air of the Highlands had fled, and he inhaled a thick gulp of hot mustard, and coughed.

â€œAye, all right,â€ he muttered ungraciously to God. â€œYeâ€™ve made your point.â€

He hadnâ€™t sought out a woman, even in his most abject loneliness, living in the cave. But when Mary MacNab had come to him on the eve of his departure for an English prison, heâ€™d found consolation for his grief in her arms. Not as replacement for Claire, never thatâ€”but only desperately needing, and gratefully accepting, the gift of touch, of not being alone for a little while. How could he possibly find it wrong that Claire had done the same?

He sighed, wriggling to find a more comfortable position. Little Chastity emitted a faint cry, and Silvia Hardman sat up at once in a rustle of clothes, bending down to the cradle with a sleepy murmur.

For the first time, the childâ€™s name struck him. The baby was perhaps three or four months old. How long had Gabriel Hardman been gone? More than a year, he thought, from what the little girls had said. Chastity, indeed. Was the name merely the natural companion to Prudence and Patienceâ€”or Mrs. Hardmanâ€™s private, poignant bitterness, a reproach to her missing husband?

He closed his eyes and sought a sense of coolness in the dark. He thought he had burned long enough.





OF CABBAGES AND KINGS

HE WALKED TO THE road just before dawn, declining help from Prudence and Patience, though they insisted upon coming with him, in case he should fall flat on his face, be stricken with sudden paralysis, or step into a gopherâ€™s hole and twist an ankle. They had no great opinion of his powers but were well mannered enough to keep a distance of a foot or so on either side, their hands hovering like small white butterflies near his elbows, pale in the half dark.

â€œThereâ€™s not so many wagons coming in, these last few days,â€ Patience observed, in a tone somewhere between anxiety and hope. â€œThee may not find a suitable conveyance.â€

â€œI should be satisfied wiâ€™ a dung cart or a wagon filled with cabbages,â€ he assured her, already glancing down the road. â€œMy business is somewhat urgent.â€

â€œWe know,â€ Prudence reminded him. â€œWe were under the bed when Washington appointed you.â€ She spoke with a certain reserve, as a Quaker opposed to the practice of war, and he smiled at her small, serious face, long-lipped and kind-eyed like her motherâ€™s.

â€œWashington is nay my greatest concern,â€ he said. â€œI must see my wife, before . . . before anything else.â€

â€œThee has not seen her in some time?â€ Prudence asked, surprised. â€œWhy?â€

â€œI was detained upon business in Scotland,â€ he said, deciding not to observe that heâ€™d seen her but two days ago. â€œIs that a wagon coming, dâ€™ye think?â€

It was a drover with a herd of swine, in fact, and they were obliged to scuttle back from the roadside with some haste, in order to avoid being either bitten or trampled. By the time the sun was fully up, though, regular traffic had begun to flow along the road.

Most of this was coming from Philadelphia, as the girls had told him: Loyalist families who could not afford to leave by ship, fleeing the city with what they could carry, some with wagons or handcarts, many with no more than what they could convey on their backs or in their arms. There were also British soldiers in groups and columns, presumably assisting the exodus and protecting the Loyalists from being attacked or looted, should Rebel militia suddenly come out of the wood.

That thought reminded him of John Greyâ€”who had been mercifully absent from his mind for several hours. Jamie ruthlessly pushed him out again, muttering, â€œAye, stay gone,â€ under his breath. But a reluctant second thought occurred to himâ€”what if Grey had been released by the militia at once and had already made his way back to Philadelphia? On the one hand, he would see to Claireâ€™s safety; he could trust the man for that. But on the other . . .

Aye, well. If he walked into the house and found Grey there with her, heâ€™d just take her away with him and say nothing. Unless . . .

â€œDoes thee still suffer from the horseradish, Friend Jamie?â€ Patience asked politely. â€œThee snorts quite fearful. Perhaps thee had best take my hankie.â€

In the woods outside Philadelphia

GREY WOKE ABRUPTLY to full daylight and a musket barrel jabbed into his belly.

â€œCome out of there with your hands up,â€ said a cold voice. He got his good eye sufficiently open as to see that his interlocutor wore a tattered Continental officerâ€™s coat over homespun breeches and an open-collared shirt, topped by a slouch hat turned up with a turkey feather through the brim. Rebel militia. Heart in his throat, he crawled stiffly out of his refuge and rose, hands in the air.

His captor blinked at Greyâ€™s battered face, then at the fetters, strips of muslin bandage hanging from the rusted links. He withdrew the musket slightly but didnâ€™t lower it. Now that Grey was on his feet, he could see several other men, as well, all peering at him with extreme interest.

â€œAh . . . where did you escape from?â€ the officer with the musket asked carefully.

There were two possible answers, and he chose the riskier option. Saying â€œgaolâ€ would have likely led to them leaving him alone or, at worst, taking him with them but leaving him in irons; either way, heâ€™d still be wearing fetters.

â€œI was put in irons by a British officer who took me up as a spy,â€ he said boldly. Entirely true, he reflected, so far as it goes.

A deep hum of interest ran among the men, who pressed closer to look at him, and the prodding musket barrel was withdrawn altogether.

â€œIndeed,â€ said his captor, who had an educated English voice, with a slight Dorset accent. â€œAnd what might be your name, sir?â€

â€œBertram Armstrong,â€ he replied promptly, using two of his middle names. â€œAnd may I have the pleasure of knowing your own name, sir?â€

The man pursed his lips a little but answered readily enough.

â€œI am the Reverend Peleg Woodsworth, Captain of the Sixteenth Pennsylvania, sir. And your company?â€ Grey saw Woodsworthâ€™s eyes flick toward his liberty cap with its bold motto.

â€œI havenâ€™t yet joined a company, sir,â€ he said, softening his own accent just a little. â€œI was on my way to do so, in fact, when I ran afoul of a British patrol and shortly thereafter found myself in the straits you see.â€ He raised his wrists a little, clanking. The hum of interest came again, this time with a distinct note of approval.

â€œWell, then,â€ Woodsworth said, and lifted his musket to his shoulder. â€œCome along with us, Mr. Armstrong, and I think we might be able to relieve your straits.â€





BLOODY MEN

ONCE THEY REACHED the trace, there were horses, mules, and wagons, as well as militia companies. Rachel was able to ride in a teamsterâ€™s wagon filled with sacks of barley, Ian and Rollo trotting along beside, as far as Matsonâ€™s Ford, where they were meant to meet Denzell and Dottie. They waited at the ford until midmorning, but there was no sign of Denzellâ€™s wagon, and none of the militia groups crossing there had seen him.

â€œHeâ€™ll have had an emergency,â€ Rachel said, lifting one shoulder in resignation. â€œWeâ€™d best go on by ourselves; perhaps we can find a wagon on the main road that will carry us into the city.â€ She wasnâ€™t troubled; any doctorâ€™s family was used to fending for themselves unexpectedly. And she loved being alone with Ian, talking, looking at his face.

Ian agreed that this was good sense, and they splashed across, shoes in hand, the cold water a relief. Even in the forest, the air was close and hot, restless with prowling thunder that never came close enough to do much good.

â€œHere,â€ he said to Rachel, and handed her his moccasins, his rifle, and his belt, with powder horn, shot bag, and dirk. â€œStand back a bit, aye?â€ He could see a scour in the streambed, where a persistent eddy had carved a deep hole, a dark, inviting shadow in the ripples of the creek. He leapt from stone to stone and jumped from the last one, going into the hole with a PLUNK! like a dropped boulder. Rollo, belly-deep in the ford and soaked to the shoulders, barked and showered Rachel with water from a huge wagging tail.



Ianâ€™s head lunged back into view, streaming water, and he reached a long, skinny arm toward her leg, beckoning her to join him. She didnâ€™t retreat but held his rifle out at armâ€™s length and raised one brow, and he dropped his invitation, scrambling out of the hole on hands and knees. He stood up in the ford and shook himself like Rollo, spattering her with icy drops.

â€œWant to go in?â€ he asked, grinning as he took back his weapons. He wiped water from his brows and chin with the back of his hand. â€œItâ€™ll cool ye right down.â€

â€œI would,â€ she said, smearing the cold droplets over her sweating face with one hand, â€œif my clothes were as impervious to the elements as thine are.â€ He had on his worn buckskin leggings and breechclout, with a calico shirt so faded that the red flowers on it were nearly the same color as the brown background. Neither water nor sun would make any difference, and he would look just the same wet or dryâ€”while she would look like a drowned rat all day, and an immodest drowned rat at that, shift and dress half transparent with water and sticking to her.

The casual thought coincided with Ianâ€™s buckling of his belt, and the movement drew her eye to the flap of his linen breechcloutâ€”or, rather, to where it had been before he raised it to pull it over his belt.

She drew in her breath audibly and he looked up at her, surprised.

â€œEh?â€

â€œNever mind,â€ she said, her face going hot despite the cool water. But he looked down, following the direction of her gaze, and then looked back, right into her eyes, and she had a strong impulse to jump straight into the water, damage to her wardrobe notwithstanding.

â€œAre ye bothered?â€ he said, eyebrows raised, as he plucked at the wet cloth of his breechclout, then dropped the flap.

â€œNo,â€ she said with dignity. â€œIâ€™ve seen one before, thee knows. Many of them. Just not . . .â€ Not one with which I am soon to be intimately acquainted. â€œJust not . . . yours.â€

â€œI dinna think itâ€™s anything out oâ€™ the ordinary,â€ he assured her gravely. â€œBut ye can look, if ye like. Just in case. I wouldna want ye to be startled, I mean.â€

â€œStartled,â€ she repeated, giving him a look. â€œIf thee thinks I am under any illusions about either the object or the process, after living for months in a military camp . . . I doubt I shall be shocked, when the occasion aâ€”â€ She broke off, a moment too late.

â€œRises,â€ he finished for her, grinning. â€œI think Iâ€™ll be verra disappointed if yeâ€™re not, ken?â€



IN SPITE OF the hot blush, which seemed to run from her scalp straight down into her nether regions, she didnâ€™t begrudge him fun at her expense. Anything that made him smile like that was balm to her own spirit.

Heâ€™d been deeply oppressed, ever since the dreadful news of the shipâ€™s sinking had come, and while heâ€™d borne up with a stoicism she thought natural to both Highlanders and Indians, saying little about it, he hadnâ€™t tried to hide his desolation from her, either. She was glad of that, despite her own sadness for Mr. Fraser, for whom she had a deep respect and affection.

She did wonder about Ianâ€™s mother and how she might have got on with that lady. At the best, she might have had a mother again herselfâ€”and that would have been a great blessing. She hadnâ€™t been expecting the best, though; she doubted that Jenny Murray would have been any more pleased at the notion of her son marrying a Friend than a Quaker meeting might be to hear of Rachelâ€™s intention of marrying a man of bloodâ€”and a Catholic, to boot. She wasnâ€™t sure which of those would be more cause for consternation but was sure that Ianâ€™s tattoos would pale in contrast to his affiliation with the Pope.

â€œHow shall we be wed, dâ€™ye think?â€ Ian, who had been walking in front of her to push branches out of her way, paused and turned to let her come alongside, the path here being wide enough to walk abreast for a little.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ she told him frankly. â€œI think I cannot in good conscience be baptized Catholic, no more than you in good conscience could live as a Friend.â€

â€œDo Friends marry only other Friends, then?â€ One side of his mouth curled. â€œIâ€™d think the choice might be a bit sparse. Or dâ€™ye all end up marrying your cousins?â€

â€œThey marry other Friends or they get put out of meeting,â€ she told him, ignoring the gibe about cousins. â€œWith rare exceptions. A marriage between a Friend and a non-Friend might be allowed in case of dire circumstanceâ€”after a committee on clearness had conferred with both bride and groomâ€”but itâ€™s rare. I fear that even Dorothea may have difficulty, in spite of her very evident sincerity of conversion.â€

Ian laughed at thought of Dennyâ€™s fiancÃ©e. Lady Dorothea Jacqueline Benedicta Grey was no oneâ€™s notion of a demure Quakerâ€”though, for that matter, Rachel thought that anyone who supposed female Friends to be demure had never met one.

â€œHave ye asked Denny what they mean to do?â€

â€œI havenâ€™t,â€ she admitted. â€œTo tell the truth, I am somewhat afraid to ask.â€

Ianâ€™s feathery brows shot up.

â€œAfraid? Why?â€

â€œBoth on his account and ours. You know we were put out of our meeting in Virginiaâ€”or, rather, he was, and I went with him. It affected him very much, and I know he wishes above all things to marry Dottie properly, before the witness of a meeting to which they both belong.â€

Ian shot her a quick glance, and she knew he was about to ask if she felt likewise. She hurried on, to forestall him.

â€œThere are other Friends in his same case, though: men who cannot abide the thought of capitulation to the King and who feel obliged to assist the Continental army. â€˜Fighting Quakers,â€™ they call themselves.â€ She couldnâ€™t help smiling at the name; it conjured such incongruous images.

â€œSome such held meeting now and then at Valley Forge, but they arenâ€™t accepted by Philadelphia yearly meeting. Denny has to do with them but hasnâ€™t joined them as yet.â€



â€œAye?â€ The trail had narrowed again and Ian moved ahead, turning his head to speak over his shoulder so she would know he attended. She was somewhat distracted herself; the buckskin was drying slowly, molding itself damply to Ianâ€™s long, sinewy shanks, and reminding her of his breechclout.

â€œYes,â€ she said, recovering her train of thought. â€œThe thing isâ€”is thee familiar with religious disputation, Ian?â€

That made him laugh again.

â€œI thought not,â€ she said dryly. â€œI am. And the thing is, when a group of . . . of . . . persons who disagree with a central teaching ofâ€”â€

â€œHeretics?â€ he offered helpfully. â€œQuakers wouldna burn folk, would they?â€

â€œThose who are led of the spirit to follow a different path, let us say,â€ she said, a little tersely. â€œAnd, no, they wouldnâ€™t. But the point I am making is that when such a group breaks away over some point of doctrine, they are inclined to cling even more rigorously to the rest of their beliefs and be more fierce even than the original group.â€

Ianâ€™s head lifted; so did Rolloâ€™s. Both hunters turned to and fro, nostrils flaring, but then shook themselves slightly and resumed walking. â€œAye, so?â€ Ian said, reminding her of her point.

â€œSo even if Denny should become convinced that he should belong to a meeting of Fighting Quakers, they might be that much more reluctant to accept a member such as Dottie. Though, on the other hand, should they be willing to do so, that might mean that they would at least consider our marriage. . . .â€ She tried to sound hopeful about that prospect but in truth thought pigs might fly before any meeting of Friends accepted Ian Murrayâ€”or vice versa. â€œIs thee attending, Ian?â€ she asked a little sharply, for man and dog were still moving but with a new wariness. Rolloâ€™s ears cocked alertly and Ian shifted his rifle from shoulder to hand. Within a few steps, she heard what they had heardâ€”the distant sounds of wagon wheels and marching feet. An army on the move, and the thought made the fine hairs prickle on her arms, in spite of the heat.

â€œWhat?â€ Ian turned a blank face toward her, then came to himself and smiled. â€œWell, no. I was wondering what a dire circumstance might be. To Friends.â€

Rachel had wondered that herself, if only briefly. â€œWell . . .â€ she began dubiously. In truth, she had no idea what sort of dire circumstance would make such a marriage thinkable, let alone acceptable.

â€œI was only thinking,â€ he went on, before she could think of anything. â€œUncle Jamie told me how it was when his parents wed. His father stole his mother away from her brothers, and they were obliged to hide where they could, for the MacKenzies of Leoch werena anything yeâ€™d want to face, when roused.â€

His face was animated, telling the story.

â€œThey couldna be marrit in kirk, for the banns couldna be called, and theyâ€™d be discovered the moment they came out of hiding to speak to a priest. So they stayed hidden until Ellenâ€”that would be my grannie, aye?â€”was big wiâ€™ child, and then came out. Her brothers couldna object to the marriage at that point, and so they were wed.â€ He shrugged. â€œSo I was only wondering: would Friends think a coming child a dire circumstance?â€

Rachel stared at him.

â€œIf thee thinks that I will lie with thee without marriage, Ian Murray,â€ she said, in measured tones, â€œthee has no notion just how dire thy own circumstances might become.â€



BY THE TIME they reached the main road that led to Philadelphia, the sound had grown amazinglyâ€”and so had the traffic making it. Normally a busy road, carrying travelers and wagons full of produce to and from the nearby countryside, it was all but choked now, mules braying, children shrieking, harried parents calling out for their offspring, pushing handcarts and barrows full of possessions along the road, often with a resentful pig towed alongside by a rope round its neck or a basket of chickens wobbling atop the pile.

And in, around, and through the struggling knots of civilians fleeing at footpace was the army. Marching columns, two by two, leather straps and gaiters creaking as they sweated through their coats, faces more crimson in the heat than their fading uniforms. Small platoons of cavalry, still fine on their horses, knots of green-clad Hessians, and, here and there, companies of infantry stationed at the side of the road, providing support for officers who were stopping wagons, sometimes commandeering them, sometimes waving them on.

Ian paused in the shadow of the trees, judging the situation. The sun was nearly overheadâ€”plenty of time. And they had nothing that the army would want; no one would stop them.

He was aware of the militia companies, too. They had met several, passing through the woods. These for the most part stayed off the road, making their way carefully through the verges in ones and twos and threes, not hiding, but not drawing attention to themselves, either.

â€œLook!â€ Rachel exclaimed, her hand tightening on his arm. â€œItâ€™s William!â€ She pointed at a tall officer on the far side of the road and looked up at Ian, her face bright as sun on water. â€œWe must speak to him!â€

Ianâ€™s hand had tightened on her shoulder in response, and he felt the urgency of her fleshâ€”but also the terrible fragility of the bones under it.

â€œNot you,â€ he said, and lifted his chin toward the plodding ranks of disgruntled troops, sweating and dust-stained. â€œI dinna want ye anywhere in sight oâ€™ them.â€

Her eyes narrowed just a trifleâ€”but Ian had been married once and took his hand off her shoulder promptly.

â€œI mean,â€ he said hastily, â€œIâ€™ll go and talk to William. Iâ€™ll bring him here to ye.â€

Rachel opened her mouth to reply, but he snooved his way hastily through the screening bushes before she could speak.

â€œStay,â€ he said sternly to Rollo, turning back for an instant. The dog, who had not stirred from his comfortable spot at Rachelâ€™s feet, twitched one ear.



William was standing by the roadside, looking hot, tired, disheveled, and thoroughly unhappy. As well he might, Ian thought with some sympathy. He kent William had surrendered at Saratoga; he was likely bound for Englandâ€”if he was luckyâ€”or for a long parole in some rough lodging somewhere far to the north. In either case, his active role as a soldier was over for some time.

His face changed abruptly at sight of Ian. Surprise, the beginnings of indignation, then a quick glance round, decision clamping down upon his features. Ian was surprised for a moment that he could read Williamâ€™s face so easily but then remembered why. Uncle Jamie guarded his own expression in companyâ€”but not with Ian. Ianâ€™s own face didnâ€™t show his knowledge, though, any more than Williamâ€™s now showed more than an irritable acknowledgment.

â€œScout,â€ William said, with the briefest of nods. The corporal to whom he had been talking gave Ian a brief, incurious look, then saluted William and plunged back into the trudging stream.

â€œWhat the bloody hell do you want?â€ William drew a grubby sleeve across his sweating face. Ian was mildly surprised at this evident hostility; theyâ€™d parted on good terms the last time they had seen each otherâ€”though there had been little conversation at the time, William having just put a pistol ball through the brain of a madman trying to kill Rachel, Ian, or both, with an ax. Ianâ€™s left arm had healed enough to dispense with a sling, but it was still stiff.

â€œThereâ€™s a lady whoâ€™d like to speak with ye,â€ he said, ignoring Williamâ€™s narrowed eyes. The eyes relaxed a little.

â€œMiss Hunter?â€ A small gleam of pleasure lit Williamâ€™s eyes, and Ianâ€™s own narrowed slightly. Aye, well, he thought, let her tell him, then.

William waved to another corporal down the line, who waved back, then he stepped off the road after Ian. A few soldiers glanced at Ian, but he was unremarkable, the double line of dotted tattooing on his cheeks, his buckskin breeches, and his sun-browned skin marking him as an Indian scoutâ€”a good many of these had deserted the British army, but there were still a good many left, mostly Loyalists like Joseph Brant, who held land in Pennsylvania and New York; there were also still some ranging parties from the Iroquois nations who had come down to fight at Saratoga.

â€œWilliam!â€ Rachel flew across the little clearing and clasped the tall captainâ€™s hands, beaming up at him with such joy that he smiled back at her, all irritability vanished. Ian hung back a bit, to give her time. There hadnâ€™t been any, really, what with Rollo roaring and tearing at Arch Bugâ€™s miserable auld carcass, Rachel sprawled on the floor, frozen with horror, himself lying on the floor pouring blood, and half the street outside screaming bloody murder.

William had pulled Rachel to her feet and thrust her into the arms of the first woman available, who, as it happened, was Marsali.

â€œGet her out of here!â€ William had snapped. But Rachel, Ianâ€™s nut-brown maidenâ€”her brownness much splattered with bloodâ€”had pulled herself together in an instant and, gritting her teethâ€”Ian had seen her do it, bemused by shock as he lay on the floor, watching things happen as though in a dreamâ€”had stepped over auld Archâ€™s body, fallen to her knees in the mess of brains and blood, wrapped her apron tight about Ianâ€™s wounded arm and tied it with her kerchief, and then, with Marsali, had dragged him bodily out of the printshop and into the street, where heâ€™d promptly passed out, waking only when Auntie Claire began stitching his arm.

Ian hadnâ€™t had time to thank William, even had he been able to speak, and he meant to convey his own thanks as soon as he might. But clearly Rachel wanted to talk to him first, and he waited, thinking how beautiful she looked, her eyes the clouded hazel of thicket and greenbrier, face clever and quick as flame.

â€œBut thee is tired, William, and thin,â€ she was saying, drawing a finger disapprovingly down the side of his face. â€œDo they not feed thee? Iâ€™d thought it was only the Continentals who went short of rations.â€

â€œOh. Iâ€”I havenâ€™t had time of late.â€ The happiness that had lit Williamâ€™s face while he talked with Rachel faded noticeably. â€œWeâ€”well, you see.â€ He waved an arm toward the invisible road, where the hoarse chants of the sergeants rang like the calling of disgruntled crows above the shuffle of feet.

â€œI do see. Where is thee going?â€

William rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth and glanced at Ian.

â€œI suppose he oughtnâ€™t to say,â€ Ian said, coming across and touching Rachelâ€™s arm, smiling at William in apology. â€œWeâ€™re the enemy, mo nighean donn.â€

William looked sharply at Ian, catching the tone of his voice, then back at Rachel, whose hand he was still holding.

â€œWe are betrothed, Williamâ€”Ian and I,â€ she said, gently pulling her hand out of his and putting it on Ianâ€™s.

Williamâ€™s face changed abruptly, losing its look of happiness altogether. He eyed Ian with something remarkably close to dislike.

â€œAre you,â€ he said flatly. â€œI suppose I must wish you every happiness, then. Good day.â€ He turned on his heel, and Ian, surprised, reached out to pull him back.

â€œWaitâ€”â€ he said, and then William turned and hit him in the mouth.

He was lying on his back in the leaves, blinking in disbelief, as Rollo hurtled over him and sank his teeth into some soft part of William, judging by the yelp and the brief cry of startlement from Rachel.

â€œRollo! Bad dogâ€”and thee is a bad dog, too, William Ransom! What the devil does thee mean by this?â€

Ian sat up, tenderly fingering his lip, which was bleeding. Rollo had retreated a little under Rachelâ€™s scolding but kept a yellow eye fixed on William and a curled lip raised over bared teeth, the faintest rumble of a growl coming from his huge chest.

â€œFuirich,â€ Ian said to him briefly, and got to his feet. William had sat down and was examining the calf of his leg, which was bleeding through his torn silk hose, though not badly. When he saw Ian, he scrambled to his feet. His face was bright red and he looked as though he meant to either do murder or burst into tears. Maybe both, Ian thought in surprise.

He was careful not to touch William again but stood back a bitâ€”in front of Rachel, just in case the man meant to go off again. He was armed, after all; there was a pistol and knife at his belt.



â€œAre ye all right, man?â€ Ian asked, in the same tone of mild concern heâ€™d heard his da use now and then on his mam or Uncle Jamie. Evidently it was in fact the right tone to take with a Fraser about to go berserk, for William breathed like a grampus for a moment or two, then got himself under control.

â€œI ask your pardon, sir,â€ he said, back stiff as a stick of rock maple. â€œThat was unforgivable. I shall . . . leave you. Iâ€”Miss Hunter . . . Iâ€”â€ He turned, stumbling a little, and that gave Rachel time to dart round in front of Ian.

â€œWilliam!â€ Her face was full of distress. â€œWhat is it? Have Iâ€”â€

He looked down at her, his face contorted, but shook his head.

â€œYou havenâ€™t done anything,â€ he said, with an obvious effort. â€œYou . . . you could never do anything thatâ€”â€ He swung round toward Ian, fist clenched on his sword. â€œBut you, you fucking basâ€”you son of a bitch! Cousin!â€

â€œOh,â€ said Ian stupidly. â€œYe know, then.â€

â€œYes, I bloody know! You could have fucking told me!â€

â€œKnow what?â€ Rachel looked from him to William and back again.

â€œDonâ€™t you bloody tell her!â€ William snapped.

â€œDonâ€™t be silly,â€ Rachel said reasonably. â€œOf course heâ€™ll tell me, the minute weâ€™re alone. Does thee not wish to tell me thyself? I think perhaps thee might not trust Ian to say it aright.â€ Her eye rested on Ianâ€™s lip, and her own mouth twitched. Ian might have taken offense at this, save that Williamâ€™s distress was so apparent.

â€œIt isna really a disgraceâ€”â€ he began, but then stepped hastily back as Williamâ€™s clenched fist drew back.

â€œYou think not?â€ William was so furious, his voice was nearly inaudible. â€œTo discover that I amâ€”amâ€”the . . . the get of a Scottish criminal? That I am a fucking bastard?â€

Despite his resolve to be patient, Ian felt his own dander start to rise.

â€œCriminal, forbye!â€ he snapped. â€œAny man might be proud to be the son of Jamie Fraser!â€

â€œOh,â€ said Rachel, forestalling Williamâ€™s next heated remark. â€œThat.â€

â€œWhat?â€ He glared down at her. â€œWhat the devil do you mean, â€˜thatâ€™?â€

â€œWe thought it must be the case, Denny and I.â€ She lifted one shoulder, though keeping a close watch on William, who looked as if he were about to go off like a twelve-pound mortar. â€œBut we supposed that thee didnâ€™t wish the matter talked about. I didnâ€™t know that theeâ€”how could thee not have known?â€ she asked curiously. â€œThe resemblanceâ€”â€

â€œFuck the resemblance!â€

Ian forgot Rachel and hit William on the head with a double-fisted thump that knocked him to his knees, then kicked him in the stomach. Had the kick landed where heâ€™d meant it to, it would have finished the matter right there, but William was a good deal faster than Ian expected him to be. He twisted sideways, caught Ianâ€™s foot, and yanked. Ian hit the ground on one elbow, rolled up, and got hold of Williamâ€™s ear. He was dimly aware of Rachel screaming and was momentarily sorry for it, but the relief of fighting was too great to think of anything else, and she disappeared as his fury surged.



There was blood in his mouth and his ears were ringing, but he had one hand on Williamâ€™s throat and the other stabbing forked for his eyes, when hands seized him by the shoulders and jerked him off his cousinâ€™s squirming body.

He shook his head to clear it, panting and pulling at whoever was holding himâ€”there were two of the villains. That earned him a thump in the ribs that knocked out what little breath he had.

William wasnâ€™t doing much better. He got to his feet, wiping the back of his hand under his nose, which was bleeding profusely. He glanced at the result and grimaced in disgust, wiping the hand on his coat.

â€œTake him,â€ he said, half breathless but in control of himself. One of his eyes was swelling shut, but the other gave Ian a look of straightforward bloodlustâ€”and, despite the circumstances, Ian was once more startled at seeing one of Uncle Jamieâ€™s expressions on another face.

There was a thunderous growl from Rollo. Rachel had the big dogâ€™s scruff twisted tight, but Ian kent well enough that she couldnâ€™t hold him if he decided to savage William. â€œFuirich, a cu!â€ he said, with all the authority he could summon. The soldiers would kill Rollo without a second thought if he lunged for Williamâ€™s throat. The dog eased back down on his haunches but stayed tensed, his lips drawn back from saliva-dripping fangs and a deep, constant growl echoing through his body.

William glanced at Rollo, then turned his back on the dog. He sniffed, hawked, and spat blood to one side, then continued, still breathing heavily. â€œTake him to the head of the column, to Colonel Prescott. Heâ€™s under arrest for assaulting an officer; heâ€™ll be dealt with at camp this evening.â€

â€œWhat does thee mean, â€˜dealt withâ€™?â€ Rachel demanded, pushing her way past the two soldiers holding Ian. â€œAnd how dare thee, William Ransom? Howâ€”how . . . how dare thee?!â€ She was white-faced with fury, small fists clenched and shaking at her sides, and Ian grinned at her, licking fresh blood from his split lip. She was paying no attention to him, though, all her ire focused on William, who drew himself up to his full height and glared down the steep bridge of his nose at her.

â€œThis is no longer your concern, madam,â€ he said, as coldly as a man who was red as a piece of flannel and shooting sparks out of his ears could manage.

Ian thought Rachel might actually kick William in the shins, and would have paid good money to see that, but her Quaker principles got the better of the situation and she drew herself up to her own not insignificant heightâ€”she was as tall as Auntie Claireâ€”and thrust her chin pugnaciously up at William.

â€œThee is a coward and a brute,â€ she declared at the top of her voice. Swinging round toward the men holding Ian, she added, â€œAnd so are you brutes and cowards, to be following an order so lacking in justice!â€

One of the soldiers sniggered, then coughed as he caught Williamâ€™s bloodshot eye upon him.

â€œTake him,â€ William repeated. â€œNow.â€ And, turning on his heel, stalked off. There was a broad stripe of pale road dust down the back of his coat and a good deal of it in his hair.



â€œBest bugger off, miss,â€ one of the soldiers advised Rachel, not unkindly. â€œYou donâ€™t want to be down amongst the troops, like, not on your own.â€

â€œI will not bugger off,â€ Rachel said, narrowing her eyes at the man in a way that reminded Ian of a panther about to spring. â€œWhat does thee intend to do to this man?â€ She gestured at Ian, who was getting his own breath back by now.

â€œRachel,â€ he began, but was interrupted by the other soldier.

â€œAssaulting an officer? Probably five hundred lashes. Wouldnâ€™t hang him, I donâ€™t sâ€™pose,â€ the man added dispassionately. â€œSeeing as young Galahadâ€™s not maimed, I mean.â€

Rachel went even whiter at this, and Ian jerked hard at his arms, getting his feet solidly under him.

â€œItâ€™ll be all right, a nighean,â€ he said, hoping he sounded reassuring. â€œRollo! Sheas! But heâ€™s rightâ€”the campâ€™s nay place for ye, and ye canna do me any good by coming. Go back to the city, aye? Tell Auntie Claire whatâ€™s happenedâ€”she can speak to Lâ€”ungk!â€ A third soldier, coming out of nowhere, had hit him in the pit of the stomach with a musket butt.

â€œWhat are you lot hanginâ€™ about for? Get on! And youâ€” â€ The soldier turned on Rachel and the dog, glowering. â€œShoo.â€ He jerked his head at Ianâ€™s captors, who obligingly hauled Ian around.

Ian tried to turn his head to give Rachel a final word, but they jerked him back and firmly down the road.

He stumbled along, in preference to being dragged, thinking furiously. Auntie Claire was his best chanceâ€”likely his only one. If she could make Lord John take a hand, either speaking to Willie or directly to this Colonel Prescott . . . He glanced up at the sun. Noon, more or less. And the British on the march carried out routine flogging and other punishment after the evening meal; heâ€™d seen it now and then, and heâ€™d seen his uncleâ€™s back now and then, too. A cold worm crawled through his sore belly.

Six hours. Maybe.

He risked another quick glance back. Rachel was running, Rollo loping alongside.



WILLIAM SWABBED HIS face with what was left of his handkerchief. His features felt foreign to him, lumped and swollen, and he explored the inside of his mouth gingerly with his tongue: no teeth missing, a couple maybe loose, and a stinging cut inside his cheek. Not bad. He thought heâ€™d done worse to Murray and was glad of it.

He was still tremblingâ€”not with shock but with the urge to rip someone limb from limb. At the same time, he was beginning to feel shock, though conscious thought still came in fleeting snatches. What the devil had he done?

A short column of soldiers marched past, a few of them openly staring at him. He gave them a vicious look, and their heads snapped forward so fast he could hear the leather of their stocks creak.

He hadnâ€™t done it. Murray had attacked him. Where did Rachel Hunter get off, calling him a coward and a brute? He felt the tickle of blood crawling down from one nostril and stanched it, snorting into the filthy rag. He saw someone approaching, coming up the road, accompanied by a large dog. He straightened, stuffing the handkerchief into his pocket.

â€œSpeak of the bloody she-devil,â€ he muttered, and coughed, his throat raw with the iron taste of blood.

Rachel Hunter was pale with rage. Apparently she hadnâ€™t turned round to apologize for her insults. She had snatched off her cap and held it clutched in one handâ€”did she mean to throw it at him? he wondered in fogged amazement.

â€œMiss Hunterâ€”â€ he began in a rasping voice, and would have bowed, save he was afraid the motion would make his nose bleed again.

â€œThee cannot mean it, William!â€

â€œMean what?â€ he said, and she gave him a look that might have singed the small hairs off his body, had he not still been hot himself.

â€œDo not be obtuse!â€ she snapped. â€œWhat possessed thee, toâ€”â€

â€œWhat possessed yourâ€”your fiancÃ©?â€ he snapped back. â€œDid I attack him? No!â€

â€œYes, you did! You struck him in the mouth, without the slightest provocationâ€”â€

â€œAnd he hit me on the head, without the least warning! If anyone is a cowardâ€”â€

â€œDonâ€™t you dare call Ian Murray coward, youâ€”youâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™ll call him what I bloody likeâ€”what he bloody is. Just like his goddamned uncle, goddamned Scottish bastard fuâ€”I mean . . .â€

â€œHis uncle? Thy father?â€

â€œShut up!â€ he bellowed, and felt the blood surge into his face, stinging all the raw places. â€œDonâ€™t call him my father!â€

She breathed stertorously through her nose for a moment, glaring up at him.

â€œIf thee allow this to be done, William Ransom, I willâ€”I willâ€”â€

William could feel the blood pool in his belly and thought he might faint, but not because of her threats.

â€œYouâ€™ll what?â€ he asked, half breathless. â€œYouâ€™re a Quaker. You donâ€™t believe in violence. Ergo, you canâ€™tâ€”or at least wonâ€™tâ€â€”he corrected himself, seeing the dangerous look in her eyeâ€”â€œstab me. You probably wonâ€™t even strike me. So what did you have in mind?â€

She did strike him. Her hand whipped out like a snake and slapped him across the face hard enough to make him stagger.

â€œSo now thee has doomed thy kinsman, repudiated thy father, and caused me to betray my principles. What next?!â€

â€œOh, bloody hell,â€ he said, and grabbed her arms, pulled her roughly to him, and kissed her. He let go and stepped back quickly, leaving her bug-eyed and gasping.

The dog growled at him. She glared at him, spat on the ground at his feet, then wiped her lips on her sleeve and, turning away, marched off, the dog at her heels casting a red-eyed look at William.



â€œIs spitting on people a part of your bloody principles?â€ he shouted after her.

She swung round, fists clenched at her sides.

â€œIs assaulting women part of thine?â€ she bellowed back, to the amusement of the infantrymen who had been standing still by the road, leaning on their weapons and gaping at the show provided.

Flinging her cap on the ground at his feet, she whirled on her heel and stamped away, before he could say more.



JAMIE CAUGHT SIGHT of a small group of redcoats coming down the road and slumped on the wagonâ€™s seat, hat pulled down over his eyes. No one would be looking for him, with the British army on the move, and even were he recognized, probably no one would bother trying to detain or question him in the midst of such an exodusâ€”but the sight of British soldiers would likely put a knot in his tailbone for the rest of his life, and today was no exception.

He turned his head casually away toward the far side of the road as the soldiers passed, but then heard a loud â€œIfrinn!â€ in a very familiar voice, and jerked round in reflex to find himself staring straight into his nephew Ianâ€™s startled, horrified face.

He was equally startledâ€”and nearly as horrifiedâ€”to see Ian, hands tied behind his back, smeared with dirt and blood and obviously the worse for wear, being shoved along by two cross-looking British privates, red-faced and sweating in their heavy uniforms.

He stifled his immediate urge to leap off the wagon and stared hard at Ian, willing the lad not to speak. He didnâ€™t, just goggled back with his eyes bulging out of his head and his face pale, as though heâ€™d seen a ghost, and walked past, speechless.

â€œJesus,â€ Jamie murmured under his breath, realizing. â€œHe thinks he has seen my fetch.â€

â€œWho thinks what?â€ asked the driver, though without much interest.

â€œI think I must get down here, sir, if yeâ€™d be so civil as to stop? Aye, thanks.â€ Without thought of his back, he swung down off the wagon; it twinged, but there was no warning stab of pain down his legâ€”and if there had been, he would still have gone up the road as fast as he could, because he saw a small figure a little way ahead, running like a rabbit with its tail on fire. The figure was plainly female, it was accompanied by a large dog, and he had the sudden thought that it might be Rachel Hunter.

It was, and he just managed to catch her up, seizing her by the arm as she ran, petticoats kirtled up in her arms and feet hammering the dust.

â€œCome with me, lass,â€ he said urgently, grabbed her round the waist, and pulled her off the road. She uttered a stifled shriekâ€”and then a much louder one, when she looked up and saw his face.

â€œNo, Iâ€™m not dead,â€ he said hurriedly. â€œLater, aye? Step back on the road wiâ€™ me now, or someoneâ€™s going to come see am I raping ye in the bushes. Ciamar a tha thu, a choin?â€ he added to Rollo, who was sniffing him industriously.

She made an odd gargling noise in her throat and continued to stare, but after an instant blinked and nodded and they were back on the road. Jamie smiled and acknowledged a man who had stopped in the middle of the road, dropping the handles of a barrow he was trundling. The man looked suspiciously at them, but Rachel, after a momentâ€™s stunned bewilderment, waved at him with a ghastly smile, and he shrugged and picked up his barrow.

â€œWh-whatâ€”â€ she croaked. She looked as though she might collapse or vomit, chest heaving and her face going scarlet and white and scarlet again. Sheâ€™d lost her cap, and her dark hair was matted with sweat and sticking to her face.

â€œLater,â€ he said again, but gently. â€œWhatâ€™s happened to Ian? Where are they taking him?â€

Between wrenching gasps, she told him what had happened.

â€œA mhâ€™ic an diabhail,â€ he said softly, and wondered for a split second whatâ€”or whoâ€”he meant by that. The thought vanished, though, as he looked up the road. Perhaps a quarter mile back, he could see the large, slow-moving knot of evacuees, a sprawling mass of slow wagons and trudging people, with the neat scarlet columns of soldiers splitting to flow round them, coming on now four abreast.

â€œAye, then,â€ he said grimly, and touched Rachelâ€™s shoulder. â€œDinna fash, lassie. Get your breath and go back after Ian, but dinna get close enough that the soldiers take notice of ye. When heâ€™s free, tell him the two of ye must come back to the city straightaway. Go to the printshop. Ohâ€”and best leash the hound wiâ€™ your sash. Ye dinna want him to eat anyone.â€

â€œFree? But whatâ€”what are you going to do?â€ Sheâ€™d got the hair out of her eyes and was calmer, though the whites of her eyes still showed all round. She reminded him of a young badger at bay, baring its teeth in panic, and the thought made him smile a little.

â€œI mean to have a word with my son,â€ he said, and, leaving her, strode purposefully up the road.



HE MADE OUT William at a considerable distance. The young man was standing at the side of the road, bare-headed, disheveled, and slightly battered, but evidently attempting to look collected; his hands were folded behind his back, and he appeared to be counting the wagons that passed him. He was alone, and Jamie hastened his step to reach the lad before anyone came along to talk to him; he needed privacy for his own conversation.

He was reasonably sure Rachel hadnâ€™t told him everything about the recent stramash and wondered whether she herself had been partly the cause of it. She had said the trouble began just after sheâ€™d told William about her betrothal to Ian. Her account had been slightly confused overall, but heâ€™d got the gist of it well enough, and his jaw tightened as he came up to William and saw the look on his face.

Christ, do I look like that in a temper? he wondered briefly. It was off-putting to speak to a man who looked as though he asked nothing more of the world than the chance to rend someone limb from limb and dance on the pieces.

â€œWell, rend away, lad,â€ he said under his breath. â€œAnd weâ€™ll see who dances.â€ He stepped up beside William and took off his hat.

â€œYou,â€ he said baldly, not wishing to call the lad by either title or name, â€œcome aside wiâ€™ me. Now.â€

The look on Williamâ€™s face changed from incipient murder to the same look of startled horror Jamie had just surprised on Ianâ€™s. Had matters been otherwise, heâ€™d have laughed. As it was, he gripped William hard by the upper arm, pushed him off-balance, and had him into the shelter of a scrim of saplings before he could set his feet hard.

â€œYou!â€ William blurted, wrenching loose. â€œWhat the devil are you doing here? And where is myâ€”what have youâ€”â€ He made a convulsive gesture of dismissal. â€œWhat are you doing here?â€

â€œTalking to you, if yeâ€™ll close your mouth for a moment,â€ Jamie said coldly. â€œListen to me, lad, because Iâ€™m telling ye what youâ€™re going to do.â€

â€œYouâ€™re not telling me anything,â€ William began furiously, and cocked a fist. Jamie grabbed him by the upper arm again, and this time dug his fingers hard into the spot Claire had shown him, on the underside of the bone. William let out a strangled â€œAgh!â€ and started to pant, his eyes bulging.

â€œYouâ€™re going to catch up the men ye sent Ian with and tell them to set him free,â€ Jamie said evenly. â€œIf ye donâ€™t, I go down under a flag of truce to the camp where theyâ€™re taking him, introduce myself, tell the commander who you are, and explain the reason for the fight. Yeâ€™ll be right there beside me. Do I make myself clear?â€ he asked, increasing the pressure of his fingers.

â€œYes!â€ The word came out in a hiss, and Jamie let go suddenly, folding his fingers into a fist to hide the fact that they were trembling and twitching from the effort.

â€œGod damn you, sir,â€ William whispered, and his eyes were black with violence. â€œGod damn you to hell.â€ His arm hung limp and must have hurt, but he wouldnâ€™t rub it, not with Jamie watching.

Jamie nodded. â€œNay doubt,â€ he said quietly, and went into the forest. Once out of sight of the road, he leaned against a tree, feeling sweat stream down his face. His back felt cast in cement. His whole body was trembling, but he hoped that William had been too distrait to notice.

God, should it have come to blows, I couldna take him.

He closed his eyes and listened to his heart, which was thumping like a bodhran. After a little, he heard the sound of hooves on the road, a horse galloping, and, turning to peer through the trees, caught a glimpse of William thundering past, heading in the direction Ian had been taken.





THE GATHERING STORM

BY BREAKFAST ON Thursday, Iâ€™d come to the firm conclusion that it was the Duke of Pardloe or me. If I stayed in the house, only one of us would remain alive by sundown. Denzell Hunter must have come into the city by now, I reasoned; heâ€™d call in daily at Mrs. Woodcockâ€™s house, where Henry Grey was convalescing. A very kind and capable doctor, he could easily manage Halâ€™s recoveryâ€”and perhaps his future father-in-law would be grateful for his professional attention.

The thought made me laugh out loud, despite my increasing anxiety.

To Dr. Denzell Hunter

From Dr. C. B. R. Fraser

I am called away to Kingsessing for the day. I surrender His Grace the Duke of Pardloe to your most competent care, in the happy confidence that your religious scruples will prevent your striking him in the head with an ax.

Yours most sincerely,

C.

Postscriptum: Iâ€™ll bring you back some asafoetida and ginseng root as recompense.

Post-postscriptum: Strongly suggest you donâ€™t bring Dottie, unless you possess a pair of manacles. Preferably two.

I sanded this missive, gave it to Colenso for delivery to Mrs. Woodcockâ€™s house, and executed a quiet sneak out the front door before Jenny or Mrs. Figg should pop up and demand to know where I was going.

It was barely seven oâ€™clock, but the air was already warming, gradually heating up the city. By noon, the pungent mix of animals, humans, sewage, rotting vegetable matter, resinous trees, river mud, and hot brick would be stifling, but for the moment, the faint scent lent a piquant touch to the gentle air. I was tempted to walk, but even my most utilitarian shoes werenâ€™t up to an hourâ€™s walk on country roadsâ€”and if I waited for sundown and the cooling evening to make my way back, Iâ€™d be remarkably late.



Neither was it a good idea for a woman to be alone on the roads, on foot. Day or night.

I thought I could manage the three blocks to the livery stable without incident, but at the corner of Walnut I was hailed by a familiar voice from a carriage window.

â€œMrs. Fraser? I say, Mrs. Fraser!â€

I looked up, startled, to see the hawk-nosed face of Benedict Arnold smiling down at me. His normally fleshy features were gaunt and lined, and his usually ruddy complexion had faded to an indoor pallor, but there was no mistaking him.

â€œOh!â€ I said, and made a quick bob. â€œHow nice to see you, General!â€

My heart had sped up. Iâ€™d heard from Denny Hunter that Arnold had been appointed military governor of Philadelphia but hadnâ€™t expected to see him so soonâ€”if at all.

I should have left it there but couldnâ€™t help asking, â€œHowâ€™s the leg?â€ I knew heâ€™d been badly injured at Saratogaâ€”shot in the same leg that had been wounded a short time before, and then crushed by his horse falling with him in the storming of Breymann Redoubtâ€”but I hadnâ€™t seen him then. The regular army surgeons had attended him, and from what I knew of their work, I was rather surprised that he was not only alive but still had two legs.

His face clouded a bit at that, but he continued to smile.

â€œStill present, Mrs. Fraser. If two inches shorter than the other. Where are you going this morning?â€ He glanced automatically behind me, registering my lack of a maid or companion, but didnâ€™t seem disturbed by it. Heâ€™d met me on the battlefield and knew meâ€”and appreciated meâ€”for what I was.

I knew what he was, tooâ€”and what he would become.

The hell of it was that I liked the man.

â€œAh . . . Iâ€™m on my way out to Kingsessing.â€

â€œOn foot?â€ His mouth twitched.

â€œActually, I had it in mind to hire a gig from the livery stable.â€ I nodded in the general direction of Davisonâ€™s stable. â€œJust round the corner there. Lovely to see you, General!â€

â€œWait a moment, Mrs. Fraser, if you would . . .â€ He turned his head toward his aide, who was leaning over his shoulder, nodding toward me, and saying something inaudible. Next thing I knew, the carriage door popped open and the aide jumped down, offering me an arm.

â€œDo come up, maâ€™am.â€

â€œButâ€”â€

â€œCaptain Evans here says the livery is closed, Mrs. Fraser. Allow me to put my carriage at your service.â€

â€œButâ€”â€ Before I could think of anything to complete this protest, I was handed up opposite the general and the door firmly shut, Captain Evans hopping nimbly up beside the driver.

â€œI gather that Mr. Davison was a Loyalist,â€ General Arnold said, eyeing me.

â€œWas?â€ I said, rather alarmed. â€œWhatâ€™s happened to him?â€

â€œCaptain Evans says that Davison and his family have left the city.â€

They had. The carriage had turned in to Fifth Street, and I could see the livery stable, its doors hanging openâ€”one of them pulled entirely off and lying in the street. The stable was empty, as was the stable yardâ€”the wagon, the gig, and the small coach gone with the horses. Sold, or stolen. From the Davisonsâ€™ house, next to the stable, the tatters of Mrs. Davisonâ€™s lace curtains fluttered limp in a broken window.

â€œOh,â€ I said, and swallowed. I darted a quick look at General Arnold. Heâ€™d called me â€œMrs. Fraser.â€ Obviously, he didnâ€™t know what my current situation wasâ€”and I couldnâ€™t make up my mind whether to tell him. On impulse, I decided not to. The less official inquiry there was into events at Number 17 Chestnut Street, the better, whether the inquiry was British or American.

â€œIâ€™m told the British kept quite a clamp on Whigs in the city,â€ he went on, looking me over with interest. â€œI hope you werenâ€™t much troubled, you and the colonel?â€

â€œOh, no,â€ I said. â€œNot really.â€ I took a deep breath, groping for some means of diverting the conversation. â€œBut I have been rather short of newsâ€”er, American news, I mean. Have there been any . . . remarkable developments of late?â€

He laughed at that, but wryly.

â€œWhere shall I start, madam?â€

Despite my unease at meeting Benedict Arnold again, I was glad for his courtesy in offering me a ride; the air was thick with moisture and the sky white as a muslin sheet. My shift was moist with perspiration after only a brief walk; I would have been wringing wetâ€”and likely on the verge of heatstrokeâ€”by the time I had walked as far as Kingsessing.

The general was excited, both by his new appointment and by the impending military developments. He was not at liberty to tell me what those were, he saidâ€”but Washington was on the move. Still, I could see that his excitement was much tempered by regret; he was a natural warrior, and sitting behind a desk, no matter how important and ornate, was no substitute for the bone-deep thrill of leading men into a desperate fight.

Watching him shift in his seat, hands clenching and unclenching on his thighs as he talked, I felt my uneasiness deepen. Not just about him, but about Jamie. They were quite different kinds of menâ€”but Jamieâ€™s blood roused at the scent of battle, too. I could only hope he wasnâ€™t going to be anywhere in the vicinity of whatever battle might be impending.

The general set me down at the ferry; Kingsessing was on the other side of the Schuylkill. He got out himself to hand me down from the carriage, in spite of his bad leg, and pressed my hand in parting.

â€œShall I send the carriage to retrieve you, Mrs. Fraser?â€ he asked, glancing up at the hazy white sky. â€œThe sky looks untrustworthy.â€

â€œOh, no,â€ I assured him. â€œI shouldnâ€™t be much longer than an hour or two about my business; it wonâ€™t rain before four oâ€™clockâ€”it never does at this time of year. Or so my son assures me.â€

â€œYour son? Do I know your son?â€ His brow wrinkled; he prided himself on his memory, Jamie had said.

â€œI donâ€™t think you would. Fergus Fraser, heâ€™s called; heâ€™s my husbandâ€™s adopted son, really. He and his wife own the printshop on Market Street.â€



â€œIndeed?â€ His face lighted with interest, and he smiled. â€œA newspaper called . . . The Onion? I heard it mentioned in the ordinary where I breakfasted this morning. A Patriot periodical, I gather, and somewhat given to satire?â€

â€œLâ€™Oignon,â€ I agreed, laughing. â€œFergus is a Frenchman, and his wife has a sense of humor. They do print other things, though. And they sell books, of course.â€

â€œI shall call upon them,â€ Arnold declared. â€œIâ€™m quite without books, having left such belongings as I possess to follow after me. But really, my dear, how will you get back to Philadelphia?â€

â€œIâ€™m sure I can borrow some form of transportation from the Bartrams,â€ I assured him. â€œIâ€™ve been to their gardens several times; they know me.â€ In fact, I intended to walkâ€”I was in no hurry to return to the Chestnut Street house and my cantankerous prisoner (what the devil was I going to do with him? Particularly now that the British had left . . .), and it was no more than an hour on footâ€”but knew better than to tell him that, and we parted with mutual expressions of esteem.

It was only a quarter hourâ€™s walk from the ferry to Bartramâ€™s Garden, but I took my time about it, as much because my mind was still on General Arnold as because of the heat.

When? I wondered uneasily. When would it begin to happen? Not yet; I was almost sure of that. What was it, what would it be, that turned this gallant, honorable man from patriot to traitor? Who would he talk to, what would plant the deadly seed?

Lord, I thought in a moment of sudden, horrified prayer, please! Donâ€™t let it be something I said to him!

The very idea made me shudder, in spite of the oppressive heat. The more I saw of how things worked, the less I knew. Roger worried a lot about it, I knew: the why of it. Why were a few people able to do this? What effectâ€”conscious or unconsciousâ€”did travelers have? And what ought they to do about it if theyâ€”weâ€”did?

Knowing what would happen to Charles Stuart and the Rising hadnâ€™t stopped him, and it hadnâ€™t stopped our being dragged into the tragedy, either. But it hadâ€”maybeâ€”saved the lives of a number of men whom Jamie had led from Culloden before the battle. It had saved Frankâ€™s life, or so I thought. Would I have told Jamie, though, if Iâ€™d known what the cost would be to him and me? And if I hadnâ€™t told him, would we have been dragged into it anyway?

Well, there werenâ€™t any bloody answers, no more than there had been the hundreds of other times Iâ€™d asked those bloody questions, and I heaved a sigh of relief as the gate to Bartramâ€™s Garden came in sight. An hour in the midst of acres of cool greenery was just what I needed.





IN WHICH MRS. FIGG TAKES A HAND

JAMIEâ€™S BREATH CAME SHORT, and he found that he was clenching and unclenching his fists as he turned in to Chestnut Street. Not as a means of controlling his temperâ€”he had it well leashed and it would stay that wayâ€”but only to let out more of the energy inside him.

He was trembling with it, with the need to see her, touch her, have her tight against him. Nothing else mattered. Thereâ€™d be words, there needed to be wordsâ€”but those could wait. Everything could wait.

Heâ€™d left Rachel and Ian at the corner of Market and Second, to go on to the printshop to find Jenny, and he spared an instantâ€™s quick prayer that his sister and the wee Quaker might get on well together, but this vanished like smoke.

There was a burning just under his ribs that spread through his chest and throbbed in his restless fingers. The city smelled like burning, too; smoke hung under a lowering sky. He noted automatically the signs of looting and violenceâ€”a half-burnt wall, the smudge of soot like a giant thumbprint on the plaster, broken windows, a womanâ€™s cap snagged on a bush and left to hang limp in the heavy airâ€”and the streets around him were full of people, but not those going about their business. Mostly men, many of them armed, half of them walking warily, glancing about, the rest standing in loose knots of excited conversation.

He didnâ€™t care what was happening, providing only that it wasnâ€™t happening to Claire.

There it was, Number 17; the neat brick three-story house that heâ€™d rushed intoâ€”and out ofâ€”three days ago. The sight of it hit him in the pit of the stomach. Heâ€™d been in there perhaps five minutes and recalled every second. Claireâ€™s hair, half brushed and clouding up around his face as he bent to her, smelling of bergamot, vanilla, and her own green scent. Her warmth and solidness in his arms, his hands; heâ€™d grabbed her by the arse, her lovely round arse so warm and firm under the thin shift, and his palms tingled with the memory of instant lust. And no more than an instant later . . .

He pushed the vision of William out of his mind. William could wait, too.

His knock at the door was answered by the rotund black woman heâ€™d seen on his first arrival, and he greeted her in much the same way, though with not quite the same words.



â€œGood day to ye, madam. Iâ€™ve come for my wife.â€ He stepped inside, past her open mouth and raised brows, and paused, blinking at the damage.

â€œWhat happened?â€ he demanded, rounding on the housekeeper. â€œIs she all right?â€

â€œI expect she is, if youâ€™re meaning Lady John,â€ the woman said, with a heavy emphasis on the name. â€œAs to all thisâ€â€”she rotated smoothly on her axis, gesturing toward the gouged, blood-smeared wall, the broken banister, and the iron skeleton of a chandelier, lying drunkenly in a corner of the foyerâ€”â€œthat would be Captain Lord Ellesmere. Lord Johnâ€™s son.â€ She narrowed her eyes and glared at Jamie in a way that made it apparent to him that she knew damned well what had happened in the hallway above when heâ€™d come face-to-face with Williamâ€”and she was not at all pleased.

He hadnâ€™t time to worry about her feelings and pushed past her as politely as possible, heading up the stairs as quickly as his twitching back muscles would allow.

As he reached the top of the stair, he heard a womanâ€™s voiceâ€”but not Claireâ€™s. To his astonishment, it was his sisterâ€™s voice, and he approached the farthest bedroom to see her back blocking the doorway. And over her shoulder . . .

Heâ€™d felt unreal ever since his conversation with William at the roadside. Now he was convinced that he was hallucinating, because what he thought he saw was the Duke of Pardloe, face contorted in annoyance, rising from a chair, clad in nothing but a nightshirt.

â€œSit down.â€ The words were spoken quietly, but their effect on Pardloe was instantaneous. He froze, and everything in his face save his eyes went blank.

Leaning forward, Jamie peered over Jennyâ€™s shoulder to see a large Highland dag in her hand, its eighteen-inch barrel trained steady on the dukeâ€™s chest. What he could see of her face was white and set like marble. â€œYe heard me,â€ she said, her voice little more than a whisper.

Very slowly, Pardloeâ€”yes, it really was him, Jamieâ€™s eyes informed his dazed mindâ€”took two steps backward and lowered himself into the chair. Jamie could smell the gunpowder in the priming pan and thought the duke very likely could, too.

â€œLord Melton,â€ Jenny said, moving slightly so as to have him silhouetted against the dim light that filtered through the shutters. â€œMy good-sister said that youâ€™re Lord Meltonâ€”or were. Is that so?â€

â€œYes,â€ Pardloe said. He wasnâ€™t moving, but Jamie saw that he had sat down with his legs flexed under him; he could be out of the chair in one lunge, if he chose. Very quietly, Jamie edged to the side. He was close enough that Jenny should have sensed him behind her, but he could see why she didnâ€™t; her shoulder blades were pressed together in concentration, sharp-edged under the cloth as a pair of hawkâ€™s wings.

â€œIt was your men who came to my house,â€ she said, her voice low. â€œCame more than once, to loot and destroy, to take the food from our mouths. Who took my husband awayâ€â€”for an instant, the barrel trembled, but then steadied againâ€”â€œaway to the prison where he took the ill that killed him. Move one inch, my lord, and Iâ€™ll shoot ye in the guts. Yeâ€™ll die quicker than he did, but I daresay ye willna think it fast enough.â€



Pardloe didnâ€™t say a word but moved his head a fraction of an inch to indicate that heâ€™d understood her. His hands, which had been clutching the arms of the chair, relaxed. His eyes left the pistolâ€”and saw Jamie. His mouth fell open, his eyes sprang wide, and Jennyâ€™s finger whitened on the trigger.

Jamie got a hand under the gun just as it went off in a puff of black smoke, the crack of the firing simultaneous with the explosion of a china figure on the mantelpiece.

Pardloe sat frozen for an instant, thenâ€”very carefullyâ€”reached up and removed a large shard of porcelain from his hair.

â€œMr. Fraser,â€ he said, in a voice that was almost steady. â€œYour servant, sir.â€

â€œYour most obedient, Your Grace,â€ Jamie replied, suffering an insane urge to laugh, and kept from it only by the sure knowledge that his sister would immediately reload and shoot him at point-blank range if he did. â€œI see yeâ€™re acquainted with my sister, Mrs. Murray.â€

â€œYourâ€”dear lord, she is.â€ Pardloeâ€™s eyes had flicked back and forth between their faces, and he now drew a long, slow breath. â€œIs your entire family given to irascibility?â€

â€œWe are, Your Grace, and I thank ye for the compliment,â€ Jamie said, and laid a hand on Jennyâ€™s back. He could feel her heart going like a trip-hammer, and her breath was coming in shallow pants. Putting the pistol aside, he took her hand in both of his. It was cold as ice in spite of the temperature in the room, which was slightly hotter than Hades, with the window shuttered and boarded over.

â€œWould ye be so amiable as to pour out a dram of whateverâ€™s in that decanter, Your Grace?â€

Pardloe did and approached warily, holding out the glassâ€”it was brandy; Jamie could smell the hot fumes.

â€œDonâ€™t let him out,â€ Jenny said, getting hold of herself. She glared at Pardloe and took the brandy, then glared at Jamie. â€œAnd where in the name of St. Mary Magdalene have you been these three days past?â€

Before he could answer, heavy footsteps came hastily down the hallway and the black housekeeper appeared in the doorway, breathing audibly and holding a silver-inlaid fowling piece in a manner suggesting that she knew what to do with it.

â€œThe two of you can just sit yourselves down this minute,â€ she said, moving the barrel of the gun back and forth between Pardloe and Jamie in a businesslike fashion. â€œIf you think youâ€™re going to take that man out of here, youâ€”â€

â€œI told youâ€”I beg your pardon, madam, but would ye honor me with your name?â€

â€œYouâ€”what?â€ The housekeeper blinked, disconcerted. â€œIâ€”Mrs. Mortimer Figg, if itâ€™s any of your business, and I doubt that.â€

â€œSo do I,â€ Jamie assured her, not sitting down. The duke, he saw, had. â€œMrs. Figg, as I said to ye downstairs, Iâ€™ve come for my wife and nothing more. If yeâ€™ll tell me where she is, Iâ€™ll leave ye to your business. Whatever that may be,â€ he added, with a glance at Pardloe.

â€œYour wife,â€ Mrs. Figg repeated, and the barrel swiveled toward him. â€œWell, now. Iâ€™m thinking that perhaps you ought just to sit down and wait until his lordship comes and we see what he has to say about all this.â€

â€œDinna be daft, Jerusha,â€ said Jenny, rather impatiently. â€œYe ken Claireâ€™s my brotherâ€™s wife; she told ye that herself.â€

â€œClaire?â€ exclaimed Pardloe, standing up again. He had been drinking from the decanter and still held it carelessly in one hand. â€œMy brotherâ€™s wife?â€

â€œSheâ€™s no such thing,â€ Jamie said crossly. â€œSheâ€™s mine, and Iâ€™ll thank someone to tell me where the devil she is.â€

â€œSheâ€™s gone to a place called Kingsessing,â€ Jenny said promptly. â€œTo pick herbs and the like. Weâ€™ve been doctoring this mac na galladhâ€”â€ She scowled at Pardloe. â€œHad I kent who ye were, a mhâ€™ic an diabhail, Iâ€™d haâ€™ put ground glass in your food.â€

â€œI daresay,â€ Pardloe murmured, and took another gulp from the decanter. He turned his attention to Jamie. â€œI donâ€™t suppose that you know where my brother is at the moment?â€

Jamie stared at him, a sudden feeling of unease tickling the back of his neck. â€œIs he not here?â€

Pardloe made a wide gesture round the room, wordlessly inviting Jamie to look. Jamie ignored him and turned to the housekeeper. â€œWhen did ye see him last, madam?â€

â€œJust before he and you skedaddled out the attic window,â€ she replied shortly, and prodded him in the ribs with the barrel of the fowling piece. â€œWhat have you done with him, fils de salope?â€

Jamie edged the barrel gingerly aside with one finger. The fowling piece was primed but not yet cocked.

â€œI left him in the woods outside the city, two days ago,â€ he said, a sudden feeling of disquiet tightening the muscles at the base of his spine. He backed against the wall, discreetly pressing his arse into it to ease his back. â€œI expected to find him hereâ€”with my wife. Might I inquire how you come to be here, Your Grace?â€

â€œClaire kidnapped him,â€ Jenny said, before Pardloe could speak. The dukeâ€™s eyes bulged slightly, though whether at the remark or at the fact that Jenny was reloading her pistol, Jamie couldnâ€™t tell.

â€œOh, aye? What did she want him for, did she say?â€

His sister gave him a look.

â€œShe was afraid heâ€™d turn the city upside down looking for his brother and youâ€™d be taken up in the kerfuffle.â€

â€œAye, well, I think Iâ€™m safe enough now,â€ he assured Jenny. â€œOught ye to turn him loose, dâ€™ye think?â€

â€œNo,â€ she said promptly, pounding home her ball and patch. She reached into her apron and came out with a tiny powder horn. â€œWe canna do that; he might die.â€

â€œOh.â€ He considered this for a moment, watching the duke, whose face had assumed a slight purple tinge. â€œWhy is that?â€

â€œHe canna breathe properly, and she was afraid if she let him loose before he was quite over it, heâ€™d die in the street, and her conscience wouldna let her do that.â€

â€œI see.â€ The urge to laugh was back, but he controlled it manfully. â€œSo ye were about to shoot him in the house, in order to keep him from dyinâ€™ in the street.â€

Her dark-blue eyes narrowed, though she kept her gaze fixed on the powder she was pouring into the priming pan.

â€œI wouldna really have shot him in the guts,â€ she said, though from the press of her lips it was apparent that sheâ€™d have liked nothing more. â€œIâ€™d just have winged him in the leg. Or maybe shot off a couple oâ€™ toes.â€

Pardloe made a sound that might have been outrage, but, knowing the man as he did, Jamie recognized it as smothered laughter. He hoped his sister wouldnâ€™t. He opened his mouth to ask just how long Pardloe had been held captive, but before he could speak, there was a knock at the door below. He glanced at Mrs. Figg, but the housekeeper was still regarding him with narrowed eyes and made no move either to lower the fowling piece or to go downstairs and answer the door.

â€œCome in!â€ Jamie shouted, sticking his head out into the hall, then jerking back into the room before Mrs. Figg should take it into her head that he was attempting to escape and discharge a load of buckshot into his backside.

The door opened, closed, and there was a pause as the caller apparently looked around the devastated entry, then light, quick steps came up the stairs.

â€œLord John!â€ breathed Mrs. Figg, her stern face lightening.

â€œIn here!â€ called the duke, as the steps reached the landing. An instant later, the slight, bespectacled form of Denzell Hunter appeared in the doorway.

â€œMerde!â€ said Mrs. Figg, bringing her shotgun to bear on the newcomer. â€œI mean, Shepherd of Judea! Who in the name of the Holy Trinity are you?â€



HUNTER WAS NEARLY as pale as Jenny, Jamie thought. Nonetheless, he didnâ€™t blink or pause but walked up to Pardloe and said, â€œI am Denzell Hunter, Friend Grey. I am a physician, come at the request of Claire Fraser to attend thee.â€

The duke dropped the decanter, which fell over and disgorged the few drops it still contained onto the braided hearth rug.

â€œYou!â€ he said, drawing himself abruptly to his full height. He was in fact no taller than Hunter, but it was obvious that he had the habit of command. â€œYou are the skulking fellow who has had the temerity to seduce my daughter, and you dare come here and offer to physic me? Get out of my sight, before Iâ€”â€ At this point, it dawned on Pardloe that he was in his nightshirt and unarmed. Nothing daunted, he seized the decanter from the floor and swung it at Denzellâ€™s head.

Denzell ducked, and Jamie got hold of Pardloeâ€™s wrist before he could try again. Denny straightened up, fire glinting behind his spectacles.

â€œI take issue both with thy description of my behavior and thy slur upon thy daughterâ€™s reputation,â€ he said sharply. â€œI can only conceive that the order of thy mind is deranged by illness or drugs, for surely the man who sired and reared such a person as Dorothea could not speak so meanly of her or have so little faith in her strength of character and her virtue as to think that anyone might seduce her.â€



â€œIâ€™m sure His Grace didna mean physical seduction,â€ Jamie said hastily, twisting Pardloeâ€™s wrist to make him let go of the decanter.

â€œIs it the act of a gentleman, sir, to induce a young woman to run away with him? Ow! Let go, damn you!â€ he said, dropping the decanter as Jamie jerked his arm up behind his back. It fell to the hearth and burst in a shower of glass, but the duke disregarded this entirely.

â€œA gentleman would have sought the approval of the young ladyâ€™s father, sir, before ever venturing to speak to her!â€

â€œI did,â€ Denzell said more mildly. â€œOr, rather, I did write to thee at once, apologizing for having been unable to speak with thee in person beforehand, and explaining that Dorothea and I wished to become betrothed and sought thy blessing upon our desire. I doubt thee received my letter before embarking for America, though.â€

â€œOh, thee did, did thee? Your desire?â€ Pardloe snorted, tossing a hank of loosened hair out of his face. â€œWill you let go of me, you bloody Scotchman! What do you think Iâ€™m going to do, strangle him with his own neckcloth?â€

â€œYe might,â€ Jamie said, easing his grip but keeping hold of Pardloeâ€™s wrist. â€œJenny, would ye put that pistol somewhere out of His Graceâ€™s reach?â€

Jenny promptly handed the freshly loaded pistol to Denzell, who took it by reflex, then regarded the thing in his hand in astonishment. â€œYou need it more than I do,â€ she said, and looked grimly at the duke. â€œIf ye shoot him, weâ€™ll all swear it was self-defense.â€

â€œWe will not,â€ said Mrs. Figg indignantly. â€œIf you think Iâ€™m going to tell his lordship I let his brother be murdered in cold bloodâ€”â€

â€œFriend Jamie,â€ Denny interrupted, holding out the pistol. â€œI should feel much happier was thee to release Dorotheaâ€™s father and take charge of this. I think that might increase the civility of our conversation.â€

â€œIt might,â€ Jamie said dubiously, but let go of Pardloe and took the pistol.

Denny approached the duke, edging glass shards out of the way, and looked carefully into his face.

â€œI will be pleased to speak and counsel with thee, Friend, and offer any reassurances that lie within my power regarding thy daughter. But thy breathing alarms me, and I would examine thee first.â€

The duke was in fact making a faint wheezing noise, and Jamie noted that the purple tinge to his face had become more pronounced. At Denzellâ€™s remark, this was augmented by a wash of dull red.

â€œYou donâ€™t touch me, you qu . . . quack-salver!â€

Denzell glanced round and seized upon Jenny as the most likely source of information.

â€œWhat did Friend Claire say regarding him, in terms of ailment and treatment?â€

â€œAsthma, and joint fir brewed in coffee. She calls it Ephedra.â€ Jenny replied promptly, turning to add to Pardloe, â€œYe ken, I didna have to tell him that. I might haâ€™ let ye strangle, but I suppose thatâ€™s no a Christian way to carry on. Are Quakers Christians, by the by?â€ she asked Denny curiously.

â€œYes,â€ he replied, advancing cautiously on Pardloe, whom Jamie had forced to sit down by pressing on his shoulder. â€œWe believe the light of Christ is present in all menâ€”though in some cases, perceiving it is somewhat difficult,â€ he added, under his breath but loud enough for Jamieâ€”and the dukeâ€”to hear.

Pardloe appeared to be trying to whistle, blowing with pursed lips, meanwhile glaring at Denzell. He gasped in air and managed a few more words.

â€œI will . . . not be doctored . . . by you, sir.â€ Another pause for blowing and gasping. Jamie noticed Mrs. Figg stir uneasily and take a step toward the door. â€œI will not . . . leave my . . . daughter in your . . . clutchesâ€”â€ Blow. Gasp. â€œIf you kill me.â€ Blow. Gasp. â€œNor risk . . . you sav . . . ing my life . . . and putting . . . me in . . . your . . . debt.â€ The effort involved in getting that one out turned him a ghastly gray, and Jamie was seriously alarmed.

â€œHas he medicine, Jenny?â€ he asked urgently. His sister compressed her lips but nodded, and, with a final glare at the duke, scurried out of the room.

With the ginger air of one embracing a crocodile, Denzell Hunter crouched, took hold of the dukeâ€™s wrist, and peered closely into his eyes, these organs repaying his inspection by narrowing in the most threatening fashion manageable by a man dying of suffocation. Not for the first time, Jamie suffered a reluctant admiration for Pardloeâ€™s strength of characterâ€”though he was likewise obliged to admit that Hunterâ€™s nearly matched it.

His concentration on the tableau before him was broken by the sound of an excited fist hammering the front door below. The door opened, and he heard his nephew Ian exclaim, â€œMam!â€ in a hoarse voice, concurrent with his sisterâ€™s astonished â€œIan!â€ Jamie stepped out of the room and, reaching the shattered banister in a few steps, saw his sister engulfed and all but obliterated by her tall sonâ€™s embrace.

Ianâ€™s eyes were closed and his cheeks wet, arms wrapped tight round his small mother, and Jamie felt a sudden lump in his own throat. What would he not give to embrace his daughter that way once more?

A slight motion drew his eye, and he saw Rachel Hunter standing shyly back, smiling at mother and son, her own eyes filled with tears. She dabbed at her nose with a handkerchief, then, happening to glance up, saw Jamie above and blinked.

â€œMiss Rachel,â€ he said, smiling down at her. He pointed at a jug standing on the occasional table by the door, which he assumed was Pardloeâ€™s medicine. â€œMight ye bring that wee jug up here? Quickly?â€ He could hear Pardloeâ€™s heavy breathing from the room behind him; it didnâ€™t seem to be getting worse but was still worrying.

The gasping was momentarily drowned out by the footsteps of Mrs. Figg, appearing behind him with her fowling piece. She peered over the banister at the touching scene below, then at Rachel Hunter, trotting up the stairs, jug in hand.

â€œAnd who is this?â€ she demanded of Jamie, not quite brandishing her weapon under his nose.

â€œDr. Hunterâ€™s sister,â€ he told her, interposing his body between Rachel, who looked taken aback, and the agitated housekeeper. â€œYour brother wants the stuff in the jug, Miss Rachel.â€

Mrs. Figg made a low rumbling noise but stepped back and allowed Rachel to pass. With a bleak look down at Jenny and Ian, who had now separated enough to speak and were waving their hands and interrupting each other in excited GÃ idhlig, she vanished back into the bedroom on Rachelâ€™s heels. Jamie hesitated, wanting to rush out the front door and head for Kingsessing, but a sense of morbid responsibility obliged him to follow her.

Denny had pulled up the stool from the dressing table and was still holding Pardloeâ€™s wrist, addressing him in calm tones.

â€œThee is in no immediate danger, as thee likely knows. Thy pulse is strong and regular, and while thy breathing is clearly compromised, I thinkâ€”ah, is this the tincture the Scotswoman mentioned? I thank thee, Rachel; will thee pourâ€”â€ But Rachel, long accustomed to medical situations, was already decanting into the brandy glass some blackish-brown stuff that looked like the contents of a spittoon.

â€œShall Iâ€”â€ Denzellâ€™s attempt to hold the glass for the duke was preempted by Pardloeâ€™s seizing the glass for himself and taking a gulp that all but choked him on the spot. Hunter calmly observed the coughing and spluttering, then handed him a handkerchief.

â€œI have heard it theorized that such cataclysms of breath as thee is experiencing may be precipitated by violent exercise, a rapid change of temperature, exposure to smoke or dust, or, in some cases, by a surge of violent emotion. In the present instance, I believe I may possibly have caused thy crisis by my appearance, and if so, I ask thy pardon.â€ Denny took the handkerchief and handed Pardloe back the glass, wise enough not to tell him to sip the stuff.

â€œPerhaps I may make some recompense for this injury, though,â€ he said. â€œI gather thy brother is not at home, since I canâ€™t suppose that he would remain absent from this gathering unless he were dead in the cellar, and I should hope thatâ€™s not the case. Has thee seen him recently?â€

â€œI haveâ€”not.â€ Pardloeâ€™s breathing was in fact growing smoother and his face a more normal color, though the expression on it was still feral. â€œHave you?â€

Hunter took off his spectacles and smiled, and Jamie was struck by the kindness of his eyes. He glanced at Rachel; her eyes were hazel, rather than her brotherâ€™s soft olive brown, and, while good-natured, were much warier. Jamie thought wariness a good thing in a woman.

â€œI have, Friend. Thy daughter and I discovered him in a militia camp some distance from the city. He had been taken prisoner, andâ€”â€ Pardloeâ€™s exclamation collided with Jamieâ€™s, and Hunter patted the air with his hand, begging attention. â€œWe were able to assist his escape, and, since heâ€™d been injured during his capture, I treated him; his injuries were not intrinsically serious.â€

â€œWhen?â€ Jamie asked. â€œWhen did ye see him?â€ His heart had given a small, disquietingly happy lurch at the news that John Grey was not dead.

â€œLast night,â€ Denny told him. â€œWe heard of his escape this morning and heard nothing of his recapture as we made our way back to Philadelphia, though I asked each group of regulars or militia we encountered. He will have needed to go with care, both woods and roads being alive with men, but I imagine heâ€™ll be with you soon.â€

Pardloe drew a long, deep breath.

â€œOh, God,â€ he said, and closed his eyes.





WELCOME COOLNESS IN THE HEAT, COMFORT IN THE MIDST OF WOE

THERE WAS PLENTY OF cool greenery available; the gardens covered the best part of a hundred acres, with trees, bushes, shrubs, vines, and flowers of all descriptionsâ€”and the odd exotic fungus thrown in here and there for variety. John Bartram had spent the greater part of a long life combing the Americas for botanical specimens, most of which he had hauled home and induced to grow. I regretted not having met the old gentleman; he had died a year before, leaving his famous garden in the capable hands of his children.

I found Young Mr. Bartramâ€”he was about forty, but so called to distinguish him from his elder brotherâ€”in the center of the gardens, sitting under the shade of an immense creeper that covered half the porch of his house, a sketchbook open on the table before him, making careful drawings of a handful of pale, leggy roots that lay on a napkin.

â€œGinseng?â€ I asked, bending to peer at them.

â€œYes,â€ he said, not taking his eyes off the delicate line of his pen. â€œGood morning, Lady John. Youâ€™re familiar with the root, I see.â€

â€œItâ€™s fairly common in the mountains of North Carolina, where I . . . used to live.â€ The casual sentence caught in my throat with a sudden unexpectedness. Out of nowhere, I smelled the woods on Fraserâ€™s Ridge, pungent with balsam fir and poplar sap, heavy with the musty scent of wood ears and the tang of wild muscats.

â€œYes, indeed.â€ Reaching the end of his line, he set down his pen, removed his spectacles, and looked up at me with the bright face of a man who lives for plants and fully expects the world to share his obsession. â€œThese are Chinese ginseng; I want to see whether I might be able to persuade it to grow hereâ€”â€ He waved a hand toward the encompassing acres of lush garden. â€œThe Carolina variety languishes, and the Canadian ginseng stubbornly refuses even to try!â€

â€œHow very perverse of it. Though I expect itâ€™s too hot,â€ I observed, taking the stool he gestured me to and setting down my basket on the floor. My shift was sticking to me, and I could feel a large splotch of spreading wetness between my shoulder blades, where my hair dripped sweat down my back. â€œThey like cold weather.â€

The vivid memory of the woods had blossomed into a visceral longing for the Ridge, so immediate that I felt the ghost of my vanished house rise around me, a cold mountain wind thrumming past its walls, and thought that, if I reached down, I could feel Adsoâ€™s soft gray fur under my fingers. I swallowed, hard.

â€œIt is hot,â€ he said, though he himself looked as dry as one of the roots on the table, dappled with shade from his vine. â€œMay I offer you some refreshment, Lady John? I have some iced negus in the house.â€

â€œIâ€™d love it,â€ I said, meaning it. â€œButâ€”iced?â€

â€œOh, we have quite a large icehouse by the river, Sissy and I,â€ he said proudly. â€œLet me just tell her . . .â€

I had had sufficient forethought as to bring a fan with me and now pulled this out of my basket. The sense of longing had turned suddenly into a newâ€”and wonderfulâ€”realization. We could go home. Jamie had been released from service with the Continental army in order to see his cousinâ€™s body back to Scotland. Heâ€™d meant, when we returned, to go back to North Carolina, reclaim his printing press, and take up arms on behalf of the revolution via the pen rather than the sword.

That plan had vanished, along with the rest of my life, when heâ€™d been reported drowned. But now . . . A thrill of excitement ran through me and must have shown on my face, for Mr. and Miss Bartram both blinked at me as they came out onto the porch. They were twins, and while their faces bore only a faint similarity of feature, they often shared the same expression and were doing so presently, both looking slightly bewildered but pleased.

I could barely keep myself from sharing my wonderful thought with them, but that wouldnâ€™t do, and I managed to sip the negusâ€”port mixed with hot water, sugar, and spices, then chilled to a coldâ€”truly cold!â€”water-beaded delightâ€”and engage in civil admiration of the ongoing improvements to Bartramâ€™s Garden, these being already famous for their beauty and variety. Old Mr. Bartram had been planning and planting and extending them for fifty years, and his children had evidently inherited the family mania, as well as the gardens.

â€œ. . . and weâ€™ve improved the river path, and weâ€™ve just put up a much bigger potting shed,â€ Sissy Bartram was saying eagerly. â€œSo many customers wanting potted vines and flowers for their drawing rooms and conservatories! Though I donâ€™t know . . .â€ Her eagerness faded a little, and she made a moue of doubt. â€œWith all this kerfuffleâ€”war is so bad for business!â€

Mr. Bartram coughed a little. â€œIt does depend on the sort of business,â€ he said mildly. â€œAnd Iâ€™m afraid we shall have a much increased demand for the medicinals.â€

â€œBut if the army is leaving . . .â€ Miss Bartram began hopefully, but her brother shook his head, his face growing sober.

â€œDoes thee not feel it in the air, Sissy?â€ he said softly. â€œSomething is coming.â€ He lifted his face, as though scenting something on the heavy air, and she reached to put a hand on his arm, silent, listening with him for the sound of distant violence.

â€œI hadnâ€™t realized that you were Friends, Mr. Bartram,â€ I said, to break the ominous quiet. Both of them blinked and smiled at me.

â€œOh,â€ said Miss Bartram. â€œFather was read out of meeting some years ago. But sometimes the habits of childhood come back when you least expect them.â€ She lifted one plump shoulder, smiling, but with something regretful behind it. â€œI see you have a list, Lady John?â€

That recalled me abruptly to my business, and the next hour was spent in busy exploration, discussion of the merits and drawbacks of various medicinals, the selection of dried herbs from the vast drying sheds, and cutting of fresh ones from the beds. With my sudden realization that we might return to the Ridge quite soon, and Mr. Bartramâ€™s very acute observation about the impending demand for medicinals, I bought much more than I had originally intended, replenishing not only my usual stocks (including a pound of dried Chinese joint fir, just in case. What was I going to do with the bloody man?), but also a good quantity of Jesuit bark, elecampane, and even lobelia, plus the asafoetida and ginseng Iâ€™d promised Denny.

In the end, there was too much for my basket, and Miss Bartram said she would put it up into a package and have one of the assistant gardeners who lived in Philadelphia bring it into the city when he went home in the evening.

â€œWould you like to see the river path, before you go?â€ she asked me, with a quick glance skyward. â€œItâ€™s not finished yet, of course, but we have some amazing things put in, and it is wonderfully cool at this time of day.â€

â€œOh, thank you. I reallyâ€”wait. You wouldnâ€™t have fresh arrowhead down there, would you?â€ I hadnâ€™t thought to put that on my list, but if it was available . . .

â€œOh, yes!â€ she cried, beaming. â€œMasses of it!â€ We were standing in the largest of the drying sheds, and the late-afternoon light falling through the boards striped the walls with bars of swimming gold, illuminating the constant rain of tiny pollen grains from the drying flowers. There was a scatter of tools on the table, and she plucked a wooden trowel and a stubby knife from the litter without hesitation. â€œWould you like to dig your own?â€

I laughed with pleasure. The opportunity to grub around in the wet mud wasnâ€™t an offer that most women would have madeâ€”especially to another woman dressed in pale-blue muslin. But Miss Bartram spoke my language. I hadnâ€™t had my hands in the earth in months, and the mere suggestion made my fingers tingle.



THE RIVER PATH was lovely, edged with willow and silver birch that cast a flickering shade over banks of nasturtium and azalea and the floating masses of dark-green cress. I felt my blood pressure drop as we strolled, chatting of this and that.

â€œDo you mind if I ask you something about the Friends?â€ I asked. â€œI have a colleague who was read out of meetingâ€”he and his sisterâ€”because he volunteered as a surgeon with the Continental army. Since you mentioned your father . . . I wondered, how important a thing is that? Belonging to a meeting, I mean?â€

â€œOh!â€ She laughed, rather to my surprise. â€œI imagine it depends upon the individualâ€”everything does, really, as a Friend. My father, for instance: he was read out of meeting, for refusing to acknowledge the divinity of Jesus Christ, but he went right on going to meeting; it made no particular difference to him.â€

â€œOh.â€ That was rather reassuring. â€œWhat ifâ€”what is a Quaker marriage like? Would one have to belong to a meeting in order to get married?â€

She thought that interesting and made low humming noises for a bit.

â€œWell, a marriage between Friends is . . . between the Friends marrying. No clergyman, I mean, and no specific prayer or service. The two Friends marry each other, rather than it being considered a sacrament administered by a priest or the like. But it does need to be done before witnessesâ€”other Friends, you know,â€ she added, a small crease forming between her brows. â€œAnd I think that there might be considerable objection if the Friends involvedâ€”or one of themâ€”had been formally expelled.â€

â€œHow interestingâ€”thank you.â€ I wondered how this might affect Denzell and Dorothea; even more, how it might affect Rachel and Ian. â€œCan a Friend marry a, er, non-Friend?â€

â€œOh, yes, of course. Though I think they would be put out of meeting as a result,â€ she added dubiously. â€œBut there might be special consideration for dire circumstances. The meeting would appoint a committee of clearness to look into the situation, I suppose.â€

I hadnâ€™t got so far as worrying about dire circumstances, but thanked her, and the conversation went back to plants.

Sheâ€™d been right about the arrowhead: there were masses of it. She smiled happily at my amazement but then left me to my digging, assuring me that I might take some of the lotus and some Sweet Flag rhizomes, as well, if I liked. â€œAnd fresh cress, of course!â€ she added over her shoulder, waving a blithe hand at the water. â€œAll you like!â€

Sheâ€™d thoughtfully brought along a burlap sack for me to kneel on; I spread it carefully, not to crush anything, and kirtled up my skirts out of the way as best I could. There was a faint breeze; there always is, over moving water, and I sighed in relief, both at the coolness and the sudden sense of solitude. The company of plants is always soothing, and after the incessantâ€”well, you couldnâ€™t call it sociability, exactly, but at least the incessant presence of people requiring to be conversed with, directed, hectored, scolded, conferred with, persuaded, lied toâ€”that I had experienced over the last few days, I found the rooted silence, rushing stream, and rustling leaves balm to the spirit.

Frankly, I thought, my spirit could use a bit of balm. Betweenâ€”or rather, amongâ€”Jamie, John, Hal, William, Ian, Denny Hunter, and Benedict Arnold (to say nothing of Captain Richardson, General Clinton, Colenso, and the whole bloody Continental army), the male of the species had been rather wearing on my nerves of late.

I dug slowly and peaceably, lifting the dripping roots into my basket and packing each layer between mats of watercress. Sweat was running down my face and between my breasts, but I didnâ€™t notice it; I was melting quietly into the landscape, breath and muscle turning to wind and earth and water.

Cicadas buzzed heavily in the trees nearby, and gnats and mosquitoes were beginning to collect in uneasy clouds overhead. These were luckily only a nuisance when they flew up my nose or hovered too close to my face; apparently my twentieth-century blood wasnâ€™t attractive to eighteenth-century insects, and I was almost never bittenâ€”a great blessing to a gardener. Lulled into mindlessness, I had quite lost track of time and place, and when a pair of large, battered shoes appeared in my field of view, I merely blinked at them for a moment, as I might at the sudden appearance of a frog.

Then I looked up.



â€œOH,â€ I SAID, a little blankly. Then, â€œThere you are!â€ I said, dropping my knife and scrambling to my feet in a surge of joyous relief. â€œWhere the bloody hell have you been?â€

A smile flickered briefly across Jamieâ€™s face, and he took my hands, wet and muddy as they were. His were large and warm and solid.

â€œIn a wagon full of cabbages, most recently,â€ he said, and the smile took hold as he looked me over. â€œYe look well, Sassenach. Verra bonny.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t,â€ I said frankly. He was grubby, very thin, and he plainly hadnâ€™t been sleeping well; he had shaved, but his face was gaunt and shadowed. â€œWhatâ€™s happened?â€

He opened his mouth to reply but then seemed to think better of it. He let go my hands, cleared his throat with a low Scottish noise, and fixed his eyes on mine. The smile had gone.

â€œYe went to bed with John Grey, aye?â€

I blinked, startled, then frowned at him. â€œWell, no, I wouldnâ€™t say that.â€

His eyebrows rose.

â€œHe told me ye did.â€

â€œIs that what he said?â€ I asked, surprised.

â€œMmphm.â€ Now it was his turn to frown. â€œHe told me heâ€™d had carnal knowledge of ye. Why would he lie about such a thing as that?â€

â€œOh,â€ I said. â€œNo, thatâ€™s right. Carnal knowledge is a very reasonable description of what happened.â€

â€œButâ€”â€

â€œâ€˜Going to bed,â€™ though . . . For one thing, we didnâ€™t. It started on a dressing table and endedâ€”so far as I recallâ€”on the floor.â€ Jamieâ€™s eyes widened noticeably, and I hastened to correct the impression he was obviously forming. â€œFor another, that phraseology implies that we decided to make love to each other and toddled off hand in hand to do so, and that wasnâ€™t what happened at all. Umm . . . perhaps we should sit down?â€ I gestured toward a rustic bench, standing knee-deep in creamy drifts of ranunculus.

I hadnâ€™t had a single thought of that night since learning Jamie was alive, but it was beginning to dawn on me that it might quite possibly seem important to Jamieâ€”and that explaining what had happened might be somewhat tricky.

He nodded, rather stiffly, and turned toward the bench. I followed, noting with some concern the set of his shoulders.

â€œHave you hurt your back?â€ I asked, frowning as I saw the care with which he sat down.



â€œWhat did happen?â€ he asked, ignoring the question. Politely, but with a distinct edge.

I took a deep breath, then blew out my cheeks in a helpless gesture.

He growled. I glanced at him, startled, having never heard such a noise from him beforeâ€”at least, not aimed at me. Apparently it was somewhat more than important.

â€œEr . . .â€ I said cautiously, sitting down beside him. â€œWhat did John say, exactly? After telling you about the carnal knowledge, I mean?â€

â€œHe desired me to kill him. And if ye tell me ye want me to kill you rather than tell me what happened, I warn ye, I willna be responsible for what happens next.â€

I looked at him narrowly. He seemed self-possessed, but there was an undeniable tension in his posture.

â€œWell . . . I remember how it began, at least. . . .â€

â€œStart there,â€ he suggested, the edge more pronounced.

â€œI was sitting in my room, drinking plum brandy and trying to justify killing myself, if you must know,â€ I said, with an edge of my own. I stared at him, daring him to say something, but he merely cocked his head at me in a â€œGo on, thenâ€ gesture.

â€œI ran out of brandy and was trying to decide whether I might walk downstairs to look for more without breaking my neck, or whether Iâ€™d had enough not to feel guilty about drinking the whole bottle of laudanum instead. And then John came in.â€ I swallowed, my mouth suddenly dry and sticky, as it had been that night.

â€œHe did say there was drink taken,â€ Jamie observed.

â€œLots. He seemed nearly as drunk as I was, save that he was still on his feet.â€ I could see Johnâ€™s face in memory, white as bone save for his eyes, which were so red and swollen that they might have been sandpapered. And the expression in those eyes. â€œHe looked the way a man looks just before he throws himself off a cliff,â€ I said quietly, eyes on my folded hands. I took another breath.

â€œHe had a fresh decanter in his hand. He put it down on the dressing table beside me, glared at me, and said, â€˜I will not mourn him alone tonight.â€™â€ A deep quiver ran through me at the memory of those words.

â€œAnd . . . ?â€

â€œAnd he didnâ€™t,â€ I said, a little sharply. â€œI told him to sit down and he did, and he poured out more brandy and we drank it, and I have not one single notion what we said, but we were talking about you. And then he stood up, and I stood up. And . . . I couldnâ€™t bear to be alone and I couldnâ€™t bear for him to be alone and I more or less flung myself at him because I very much needed someone to touch me just then.â€

â€œAnd he obliged ye, I take it.â€

The tone of this was distinctly cynical, and I felt a flush rise in my cheeks, not of embarrassment but of anger.

â€œDid he bugger you?â€

I looked at him for a good long minute. He meant it.

â€œYou absolute bastard,â€ I said, as much in astonishment as anger. Then a thought occurred to me. â€œYou said he desired you to kill him,â€ I said slowly. â€œYou . . . didnâ€™t, did you?â€

He held my eyes, his own steady as a rifle barrel.

â€œWould ye mind if I did?â€ he asked softly.

â€œYes, I bloody well would,â€ I said, with what spirit I could summon up amongst the growing confusion of my feelings. â€œBut you didnâ€™tâ€”I know you didnâ€™t.â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, even more softly. â€œYe donâ€™t know that.â€

Despite my conviction that he was bluffing, a small chill prickled the hairs on my forearms.

â€œI should have been within my rights,â€ he said.

â€œYou would not,â€ I said, chill fading into crossness. â€œYou didnâ€™t have any rights. You were bloody dead.â€ Despite the crossness, my voice broke a bit on the word â€œdead,â€ and his face changed at once.

â€œWhat?â€ I said, turning my own face away. â€œDid you think it didnâ€™t matter?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, and took my mud-stained hand in his. â€œBut I didna ken it mattered quite that much.â€ His own voice was husky now, and when I turned back to him, I saw that tears stood in his eyes. With an incoherent noise, I flung myself into his arms and clung to him, making foolish hiccuping sobs.

He held me tight, his breath warm on the top of my head, and when I stopped at last, he put me away a little and cupped my face in his hands.

â€œI have loved ye since I saw you, Sassenach,â€ he said very quietly, holding my eyes with his own, bloodshot and lined with tiredness but very blue. â€œI will love ye forever. It doesna matter if ye sleep with the whole English armyâ€”well, no,â€ he corrected himself, â€œit would matter, but it wouldna stop me loving you.â€

â€œI didnâ€™t think it would.â€ I sniffed and he pulled a handkerchief from his sleeve and handed it to me. It was worn white cambric and had the initial â€œPâ€ embroidered awkwardly in one corner in blue thread. I couldnâ€™t imagine where heâ€™d got such a thing but didnâ€™t bother asking, under the circumstances.

The bench was not very large, and his knee was within an inch or two of mine. He didnâ€™t touch me again, though, and my heart rate was beginning to speed up noticeably. He meant it, about loving me, but that didnâ€™t mean the next while was going to be pleasant.

â€œIt was my impression that he told me because he was sure that you would tell me,â€ he said carefully.

â€œSo I would have,â€ I said promptly, wiping my nose. â€œThough I might possibly have waited â€™til youâ€™d got home, had a bath, and been fed supper. If thereâ€™s one thing I know about men, itâ€™s that you donâ€™t break things like this to them on an empty stomach. When did you last eat?â€

â€œThis morning. Sausages. Dinna be changing the subject.â€ His voice was level, but there was a good deal of feeling bubbling under it; he might as well have been a pan of simmering milk. One extra degree of heat and thereâ€™d be an eruption and scorched milk all over the stove. â€œI understand, but I wantâ€”I needâ€”to know what happened.â€

â€œYou understand?â€ I echoed, sounding surprised even to my own ears. I hoped he did understand, but his manner was more than a little at odds with his words. My hands were no longer cold; they were starting to sweat, and I gripped the skirt over my knees, heedless of mud stains.

â€œWell, I dinna like it,â€ he said, not quite between clenched teeth. â€œBut I understand it.â€

â€œYou do?â€

â€œI do,â€ he said, eyeing me. â€œYe both thought I was dead. And I ken what yeâ€™re like when youâ€™re drunk, Sassenach.â€

I slapped him, so fast and so hard that he hadnâ€™t time to duck and lurched back from the impact.

â€œYouâ€”youâ€”â€ I said, unable to articulate anything bad enough to suit the violence of my feelings. â€œHow bloody dare you!â€

He touched his cheek gingerly. His mouth was twitching.

â€œI . . . uh . . . didna quite mean that the way it sounded, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œBesides, am I no the aggrieved party here?â€

â€œNo, you bloody arenâ€™t!â€ I snapped. â€œYou go off and getâ€”get drowned, and leave me all alone in the m-midst of spies and s-soldiers and with childrenâ€”you and Fergus both, you bastards! Leave me and Marsali to-toâ€”â€ I was so choked with emotion that I couldnâ€™t go on. I was damned if Iâ€™d cry, though, damned if Iâ€™d cry any more in front of him.

He reached out carefully and took my hand again. I let him, and let him draw me closer, close enough to see the faint dusting of his beard stubble, to smell the road dust and dried sweat in his clothes, to feel the radiant heat from his body.

I sat quivering, making small huffing sounds in lieu of speech. He ignored this, spreading my fingers out between his own, gently stroking the palm of my hand with a large, callused thumb.

â€œI didna mean to imply that I think ye a drunkard, Sassenach,â€ he said, making an obvious effort to be conciliatory. â€œItâ€™s only that ye think wiâ€™ your body, Claire; ye always have.â€

With a tremendous effort of my own, I found words.

â€œSo Iâ€™m aâ€”aâ€”what are you calling me now? A loose woman? A trollop? A strumpet? And you think thatâ€™s better than calling me a drunkard?!?â€

He gave a small snort of what might have been amusement. I yanked at my hand, but he wouldnâ€™t let go.

â€œI said what I meant, Sassenach,â€ he said, tightening his grip on my hand, and augmenting it with another hand on my forearm, preventing me from rising. â€œYe think wiâ€™ your body. Itâ€™s what makes ye a surgeon, no?â€

â€œIâ€”oh.â€ Overcoming my dudgeon momentarily, I was obliged to admit that there was something in this observation.

â€œPossibly,â€ I said stiffly, looking away from him. â€œBut I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s what you meant.â€

â€œNot entirely, no.â€ There was a very slight edge to his voice again, but I wouldnâ€™t meet his eyes. â€œListen to me.â€

I sat stubbornly silent for a moment, but he simply held on, and I knew that he was more stubborn by nature than I could be if I worked at it for a hundred years. I was going to hear what he had to sayâ€”and I was going to tell him what he wanted to hearâ€”whether I liked it or not.



â€œIâ€™m listening,â€ I said. He drew breath and relaxed a little but didnâ€™t lessen his grip.

â€œIâ€™ve taken ye to bed a thousand times at least, Sassenach,â€ he said mildly. â€œDid ye think I wasna paying attention?â€

â€œTwo or three thousand at least,â€ I said, in the interests of strict accuracy, staring at the digging knife Iâ€™d dropped on the ground. â€œAnd no.â€

â€œWell, then. I ken what yeâ€™re like in bed. And I seeâ€”all too well,â€ he added, his mouth compressing momentarily, â€œâ€”how this likely was.â€

â€œNo, you bloody donâ€™t,â€ I said warmly.

He made another Scottish noise, this one indicating hesitation.

â€œI do,â€ he said, but carefully. â€œWhen I lost ye, after Cullodenâ€”I kent ye werenâ€™t dead, but that made it all the worse, if ye ask me . . . eh?â€

I had made a noise of my own but gestured briefly at him to go on.

â€œI told ye about Mary MacNab, aye? How she came to me, in the cave?â€

â€œSeveral years after the fact,â€ I said rather coldly. â€œBut, yes, you did get round to it eventually.â€ I gave him a look. â€œI certainly didnâ€™t blame you for thatâ€”and I didnâ€™t ask you for the gory details, either.â€

â€œNo, ye didnâ€™t,â€ he admitted. He rubbed the bridge of his nose with a knuckle. â€œMaybe ye werenâ€™t jealous. I am.â€ He hesitated. â€œIâ€™d tell ye, thoughâ€”how it wasâ€”if ye wanted to know.â€

I looked at him, biting my lip dubiously. Did I want to know? If I didnâ€™tâ€”and I wasnâ€™t at all sure whether I did or notâ€”would he take that as evidence that I didnâ€™t care? And I was quite conscious of that brief â€œI am.â€

I took a deep breath, accepting the implied bargain.

â€œTell me,â€ I said. â€œHow it was.â€

Now he did look away, and I saw his throat move as he swallowed.

â€œIt . . . was tender,â€ he said quietly, after a moment. â€œSad.â€

â€œSad,â€ I echoed. â€œHow?â€

He didnâ€™t look up but kept his eyes fixed on the flowers, following the movements of a big black bumblebee among the furled blooms.

â€œBoth of us mourning things that were lost,â€ he said slowly, brows drawn down in thought. â€œShe said she meant to keep ye alive for me, to let me . . . to let me imagine it was you, I suppose she meant.â€

â€œDidnâ€™t work quite that way?â€

â€œNo.â€ He looked up then, straight on, and his eyes went through me like a rapier through a scarecrow. â€œThere couldna be anyone like you.â€

It wasnâ€™t said with an air of compliment, more one of flat finalityâ€”or, even, of resentment.

I lifted a shoulder briefly. There wasnâ€™t much response I could make.

â€œAnd?â€

He sighed and looked back at his knotted hands. He was squeezing the fingers of his narrowed right hand with his left, as though to remind himself of the missing finger.

â€œIt was quiet,â€ he said to his thumb. â€œWe didna talk, really, not once weâ€™d . . . begun.â€ He closed his eyes, and I wondered, with a small twinge of curiosity, just what he saw. I was surprised to realize that curiosity was all I feltâ€”with, perhaps, pity for them. Iâ€™d seen the cave in which theyâ€™d made love, a cold granite tomb, and I knew how desperate the state of things had been in the Highlands then. Just the promise of a little human warmth . . . â€œBoth of us mourning things that were lost,â€ heâ€™d said.

â€œIt was just the once. It didna last very long; Iâ€”it had been a long time,â€ he said, and a faint flush showed across his cheekbones. â€œBut . . . I needed it, verra much. She held me after, and . . . I needed that more. I fell asleep in her arms; she was gone when I woke. But I carried the warmth of her with me. For a long time,â€ he said very softly.

That gave me a quite unexpected stab of jealousy, and I straightened a little, fighting it back with clenched hands. He sensed it and turned his head toward me. Heâ€™d felt that flame igniteâ€”and had one to match it.

â€œAnd you?â€ he said, giving me a hard, direct look.

â€œIt wasnâ€™t tender,â€ I said with an edge. â€œAnd it wasnâ€™t sad. It should have been. When he came into my room and said he wouldnâ€™t mourn you alone, and we talked, then I got up and went to him, expectingâ€”if I had so much as an expectation; I donâ€™t think I had any conscious thoughts. . . .â€

â€œNo?â€ He matched my edge with his own. â€œBlind drunk, were ye?â€

â€œYes, I bloody was, and so was he.â€ I knew what he was thinking; he wasnâ€™t making any effort to hide it, and I had a sudden, vivid recollection of sitting with him in the corner of a tavern in Cross Creek, his taking my face suddenly between his hands and kissing me, and the warm sweetness of wine passing from his mouth to mine. I sprang to my feet and slapped my hand on the bench.

â€œYes, I bloody was!â€ I said again, furious. â€œI was drunk every damned day since I heard you were dead.â€

He drew a deep, deep breath, and I saw his eyes fix on his hands, clenched on his knees. He let it out very slowly.

â€œAnd what did he give ye, then?â€

â€œSomething to hit,â€ I said. â€œAt least to begin with.â€

He looked up at me, startled.

â€œYe hit him?â€

â€œNo, I hit you,â€ I snapped. My fist had curled, without my realization, clenched against my thigh. I remembered that first blow, a blind, frenzied punch into unwary flesh, all the force of my grief behind it. The flex of recoil that took away the sensation of warmth for an instant, brought it back with a smash that flung me onto the dressing table, borne down by a manâ€™s weight, his grip tight on my wrists, and me screaming in fury. I didnâ€™t remember the specifics of what came nextâ€”or, rather, I recalled certain things very vividly but had no idea of the order in which they happened.

â€œIt was a blur,â€ people say. What they really mean is the impossibility of anyone truly entering such an experience from outside, the futility of explanation.

â€œMary MacNab,â€ I said abruptly. â€œShe gave you . . . tenderness, you said. There should be a word for what this was, what John gave me, but I havenâ€™t thought of it yet.â€ I needed a word that might convey, encapsulate.

â€œViolence,â€ I said. â€œThat was part of it.â€ Jamie stiffened and gave me a narrow look. I knew what he was thinking and shook my head. â€œNot that. I was numbâ€”deliberately numb, because I couldnâ€™t bear to feel. He could; he had more courage than I did. And he made me feel it, too. Thatâ€™s why I hit him.â€

Iâ€™d been numb, and John had ripped off the dressing of denial, the wrappings of the small daily necessities that kept me upright and functioning; his physical presence had torn away the bandages of grief and showed what lay below: myself, bloody and unhealed.

I felt the air thick in my throat, damp and hot and itching on my skin. And finally I found the word.

â€œTriage,â€ I said abruptly. â€œUnder the numbness, I was . . . raw. Bloody. Skinned. You do triage, you . . . stop the bleeding first. You stop it. You stop it, or the patient dies. He stopped it.â€

Heâ€™d stopped it by slapping his own grief, his own fury, over the welling blood of mine. Two wounds, pressed together, blood still flowing freelyâ€”but no longer lost and draining, flowing instead into another body, and the otherâ€™s blood into mine, hot, searing, not welcomeâ€”but life.

Jamie said something under his breath in Gaelic. I didnâ€™t catch most of the words. He sat with his head bent, elbows on his knees and head in his hands, and breathed audibly.

After a moment, I sat back down beside him and breathed, too. The cicadas grew louder, an urgent buzz that drowned out the rush of water and the rustling of leaves, humming in my bones.

â€œDamn him,â€ Jamie muttered at last, and sat up. He looked disturbed, angryâ€”but not angry at me.

â€œJohn, um, is all right, isnâ€™t he?â€ I asked hesitantly. To my surpriseâ€”and my slight uneaseâ€”Jamieâ€™s lips twisted a little.

â€œAye. Well. Iâ€™m sure he is,â€ he said, in a tone admitting of a certain doubt, which I found alarming.

â€œWhat the bloody hell did you do to him?â€ I said, sitting up straight.

His lips compressed for an instant.

â€œI hit him,â€ he said. â€œTwice,â€ he added, glancing away.

â€œTwice?â€ I echoed, in some shock. â€œDid he fight you?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said shortly.

â€œReally.â€ I rocked back a bit, looking him over. Now that I had calmed down enough to take notice, I thought he was displaying . . . what? Concern? Guilt?

â€œWhy did you hit him?â€ I asked, striving for a tone of mild curiosity, rather than one of accusation. Evidently I was less than successful with this, as he turned on me like a bear stung in the rump by a bee.

â€œWhy? Ye dare to ask me why?â€

â€œCertainly I do,â€ I said, discarding the mild tone. â€œWhat did he do to make you hit him? And twice?â€ Jamie had no problem with mayhem, but he normally did require a reason.

He made a deeply disgruntled Scottish noise, but heâ€™d promised me honesty a long time ago and hadnâ€™t seen fit to break that promise yet. He squared his shoulders and looked at me straight.

â€œThe first was between him and me; it was a blow Iâ€™ve owed him for a good while.â€



â€œAnd you just seized the opportunity to punch him, because it was convenient?â€ I asked, a bit wary of asking directly what the devil he meant by â€œbetween him and me.â€

â€œI couldna help it,â€ he said testily. â€œHe said something and I hit him.â€

I didnâ€™t say anything but inhaled through my nose, meaning him to hear it. There was a long moment of silence, weighted with expectation and broken only by the shush of the river.

â€œHe said the two of ye hadna been making love to each other,â€ he finally muttered, looking down.

â€œNo, we werenâ€™t,â€ I said, somewhat surprised. â€œI told you. We were bothâ€”oh!â€

He did look up at me then, glaring.

â€œOh,â€ he said, the word dripping with sarcasm. â€œYe were both fucking me, he said.â€

â€œOh, I see,â€ I murmured. â€œWell. Um. Yes, thatâ€™s quite true.â€ I rubbed the bridge of my nose. â€œI see,â€ I said again, and thought I probably did. There was a deep friendship of long standing between Jamie and John, but I was aware that one of the pillars it rested on was a strict avoidance of any reference to Johnâ€™s sexual attraction toward Jamie. If John had lost his composure sufficiently as to kick that pillar out from under the two of them . . .

â€œAnd the second time?â€ I asked, choosing not to ask him to elaborate any further on the first.

â€œAye, well, that one was on your account,â€ he said, both voice and face relaxing a little.

â€œIâ€™m flattered,â€ I said, as dryly as possible. â€œBut you really shouldnâ€™t have.â€

â€œWell, I ken that now,â€ he admitted, flushing. â€œBut Iâ€™d lost my temper already and hadna got it back again. Ifrinn,â€ he muttered, and, stooping, picked up the discarded digging knife and jammed it hard into the bench beside him.

He closed his eyes then, pressed his lips tight, and sat tapping the fingers of his right hand against his leg. He hadnâ€™t done that since Iâ€™d amputated the remains of his frozen fourth finger, and I was taken aback to see him do it now. For the first time, I began to appreciate the true complexities of the situation.

â€œTell me,â€ I said, in a voice not much louder than the cicadas. â€œTell me what youâ€™re thinking.â€

â€œAbout John Grey. About Helwater.â€ He drew a deep, exasperated breath and opened his eyes, though he didnâ€™t look at me. â€œI managed there. Staying numb, as ye said. I suppose I might have stayed drunk, too, had I been able to afford it.â€ His mouth twisted, and he folded his right hand into a fist, then looked down at it in surprise; he hadnâ€™t been able to do that for thirty years. He opened it and put his hand flat on his knee.

â€œI managed,â€ he repeated. â€œBut then there was Genevaâ€”and I told ye how that was, too, did I not?â€

â€œYou did.â€

He sighed. â€œAnd then there was William. When Geneva died and it was my fault, it was a knife in my heartâ€”and then William . . .â€ His mouth softened. â€œThe bairn cut me wide open, Sassenach. He spilled my guts out into my hands.â€

I put my hand on his, and he turned it, his fingers curling over mine.

â€œAnd that bloody English sodomite bandaged me,â€ he said, so low I could scarcely hear him above the sound of the river. â€œWith his friendship.â€

He drew breath again and let it out explosively. â€œNo, I didna kill him. I dinna ken if Iâ€™m glad of it or notâ€”but I didnâ€™t.â€

I let out my own breath in a deep sigh and leaned against him.

â€œI knew that. Iâ€™m glad.â€

The haze had thickened into steel-gray clouds, coming purposefully up the river, muttering with thunder. I took a deep, lung-filling whiff of ozone and then another, of his skin. I detected the basic male animal, very appetizing in itself, but he seemed to have acquired a rather unusualâ€”though savoryâ€”bouquet in addition: a faint whiff of sausage, the strong bitter scent of cabbage, and . . . yes, mustard, underlaid with something oddly spicy. I sniffed again, repressing the urge to lick him.

â€œYou smell likeâ€”â€

â€œI smell like a large plate of choucroute garnie,â€ he interrupted, with a slight grimace. â€œGive me a moment; Iâ€™ll have a wash.â€ He made as though to get up and go toward the river, and I reached out and seized him by the arm.

He looked at me for a moment, then drew a deep breath and, reaching slowly out in turn, pulled me against him. I didnâ€™t resist. In fact, my own arms went round him in reflex, and we both sighed in unison, in the sheer relief of embrace.

I would have been quite content to sit there forever, breathing the musky, dusty, cabbage-laced smell of him and listening to the thump of his heart under my ear. All the things weâ€™d saidâ€”all the things that had happenedâ€”hovered in the air around us like the cloud of troubles from Pandoraâ€™s box,â€”but for this one moment, there was nothing but each other.

After a bit, his hand moved, smoothing the loose, damp curls behind my ear. He cleared his throat and shifted a little, drawing himself up, and I reluctantly let go of him, though I left my hand on his thigh.

â€œI wish to say something,â€ he said, in the tone of one making a formal statement before a court. My heart had quieted while he held me; now it fluttered in renewed agitation.

â€œWhat?â€ I sounded so apprehensive that he laughed. Only a breath, but he did laugh, and I was able to breathe again. He took my hand firmly and held it, looking into my eyes.

â€œI donâ€™t say that I dinna mind this, because I do. And I donâ€™t say that Iâ€™ll no make a fuss about it later, because I likely will. But what I do say is that there is nothing in this world or the next that can take ye from meâ€”or me from you.â€ He raised one brow. â€œDâ€™ye disagree?â€

â€œOh, no,â€ I said fervently.

He breathed again, and his shoulders came down a fraction of an inch.

â€œWell, thatâ€™s good, because it wouldna do ye any good if ye did. Just the one question,â€ he said. â€œAre ye my wife?â€

â€œOf course I am,â€ I said, in utter astonishment. â€œHow could I not be?â€



His face changed then; he drew a huge breath and took me into his arms. I embraced him, hard, and together we let out a great sigh, settling with it, his head bending over mine, kissing my hair, my face turned into his shoulder, openmouthed at the neck of his open shirt, our knees slowly giving way in mutual relief, so that we knelt in the fresh-turned earth, clinging together, rooted like a tree, leaf-tossed and multi-limbed but sharing one single solid trunk.

The first drops of rain began to fall.



HIS FACE WAS open now and his eyes clear blue and free of troubleâ€”for the moment, at least. â€œWhere is there a bed? I need to be naked with ye.â€

I was entirely in sympathy with this proposition, but the question took me momentarily aback. Of course we couldnâ€™t go to Johnâ€™s houseâ€”or at least not in order to go to bed together. Even if John himself was in no position to object, the thought of what Mrs. Figg would say if I walked into the house with a large Scotsman and immediately ascended the stairs to my bedroom with him . . . and then there was Jenny . . . On the other hand, eager as I was, I really didnâ€™t want to be naked with him among the ranunculus, where we might be interrupted at any moment by Bartrams, bumblebees, or rain.

â€œAn inn?â€ I suggested.

â€œIs there one where folk wouldna ken ye? A decent one, I mean?â€

I knit my brows, trying to think of one. Not the Kingâ€™s Arms, definitely not that. Otherwise . . . I was familiar only with the two or three ordinaries where Marsali bought ale or breadâ€”and people most assuredly knew me thereâ€”as Lady John Grey.

It wasnâ€™t that Jamie by himself needed to avoid notice anymoreâ€”but his supposed death and my marriage to John had been the subject of a tremendous amount of public interest, by reason of its tragedy. For it to become widely known that the presumably deceased Colonel Fraser had suddenly reappeared from the dead to reclaim his wife would be a subject of conversation that would dwarf the withdrawal of the British army from the city. I had a quick flash of memoryâ€”our wedding night, witnessed at close quarters by a crowd of raucously drunk Highland clansmenâ€”and imagined a reprise of this experience, with interested commentary by the ordinaryâ€™s patrons.

I glanced at the river, wondering whether, after all, a nice, sheltering bushâ€”but it was late in the afternoon, cloudy, and the gnats and mosquitoes were hanging in small carnivorous clouds of their own beneath the trees. Jamie stooped suddenly and swept me up in his arms.

â€œIâ€™ll find a place.â€



THERE WAS A wooden thump as he kicked open the door of the new potting shed, and suddenly we were in a light-streaked darkness smelling of sun-warmed boards, earth, water, damp clay, and plants.



â€œWhat, here?â€

It was abundantly clear that he wasnâ€™t seeking privacy for the purpose of further inquiry, discussion, or reproach. For that matter, my own question was largely rhetorical.

He stood me on my feet, turned me about, and began undoing my laces. I could feel his breath on the bare skin of my neck, and the tiny hairs there shivered.

â€œAre youâ€”â€ I began, only to be interrupted by a terse â€œHush.â€ I hushed. I could hear then what heâ€™d heard: the Bartrams, in conversation with each other. They were some distance away, thoughâ€”on the back porch of the house, I thought, screened from the river path by a thick hedge of English yew.

â€œI donâ€™t think they can hear us,â€ I said, though I lowered my voice.

â€œIâ€™ve done wiâ€™ talking,â€ he whispered, and, leaning forward, closed his teeth gently on the nape of my exposed neck.

â€œHush,â€ he said again, though mildly. I hadnâ€™t actually said anything, and the sound Iâ€™d made was too high-pitched to draw the attention of anything save a passing bat. I exhaled strongly through my nose and heard him chuckle deep in his throat.

My stays came loose, and cool air flooded through the damp muslin of my shift. He paused, one hand on the tapes of my petticoats, to reach round with the other and gently lift one breast, heavy and free, thumb rubbing the nipple, hard and round as a cherry stone. I made another sound, this one lower-pitched.

I thought vaguely how fortunate it was that he was left-handed, as that was the hand nimbly engaged in undoing the tapes of my skirts. These fell in a swishing heap round my feet, and I had a sudden visionâ€”as his hand left my breast and the shift whiffed up round my earsâ€”of Young Mr. Bartram suddenly realizing a dire need to pot up a batch of rosemary seedlings. The shock probably wouldnâ€™t kill him, but . . .

â€œMay as well be hung for sheep as lambs,â€ Jamie said, having evidently divined my thought from the fact that Iâ€™d turned round and was shielding my more private bits in the manner of Botticelliâ€™s Venus. â€œAnd Iâ€™ll have ye naked.â€

He grinned at me, whipped off his own dirt-streaked shirtâ€”heâ€™d thrown off his coat when he set me downâ€”and yanked down his breeks without pausing to undo the flies. He was thin enough to make this possible; the breeches hung on his hipbones, barely staying up by themselves, and I saw the shadow of his ribs beneath his skin as he bent to shed his stockings.

He straightened and I put a hand on his chest. It was damp and warm, and the ruddy hairs prickled into gooseflesh at my touch. I could smell the hot, eager scent of him, even over the agricultural fug of the shed and the lingering smell of cabbage.

â€œNot so fast,â€ I whispered.

He made a Scottish sound of interrogation, reaching for me, and I dug my fingers into the muscle of his breast.

â€œI want a kiss first.â€

He put his mouth against my ear and both hands firmly on my bottom.



â€œAre ye in a position to make demands, dâ€™ye think?â€ he whispered, tightening his grasp. I caught the faint barb in that.

â€œYes, I bloody am,â€ I said, and adjusted my own grip somewhat lower. He wouldnâ€™t be attracting any bats, I thought.

We were eyeball-to-eyeball, clasped and breathing each otherâ€™s breath, close enough to see the smallest nuance of expression, even in the dimness. I saw the seriousness that underlay the laughterâ€”and the doubt beneath the bravado.

â€œI am your wife,â€ I whispered, my lips brushing his.

â€œI ken that,â€ he said, very softly, and kissed me. Softly. Then closed his eyes and brushed his lips across my face, not so much kissing as feeling the contours of cheekbone and brow, of jaw and the tender skin below the ear, seeking to know me again past skin and breath, to know me to the blood and bone, to the heart that beat beneath.

I made a small sound and tried to find his mouth with my own, pressing against him, bare bodies cool and damp, hair rasping sweetly, and the lovely firmness of him rolling between us. He wouldnâ€™t let me kiss him, though. His hand gripped the tail of my hair at the base of my neck, cupping my head, the other hand pursuing the same game of blind manâ€™s buff.

There was a rattling thump; I had backed into a potting bench, setting a tray of tiny seedling pots to vibrating, the spicy leaves of sweet basil trembling in agitation. Jamie pushed the tray aside with one hand, then grasped me by the elbows and lifted me onto the bench.

â€œNow,â€ he said, half breathless. â€œI must have ye now.â€

He did, and I ceased caring whether there were splinters in the bench or not.

I wrapped my legs round him and he laid me flat and leaned over me, hands braced on the bench, with a sound halfway between bliss and pain. He moved slowly in me and I gasped.

The rain had grown from a patter to a ringing din on the tin roof of the shed, covering any sounds I might make, and a good thing, too, I thought dimly. The air had cooled but was full of moisture; our skins were slick, and heat sprang up where flesh touched flesh. He was slow, deliberate, and I arched my back, urging him. In response, he took me by the shoulders, bent lower, and kissed me lightly, barely moving.

â€œI willna do it,â€ he whispered, and held tight when I struggled against him, trying vainly to goad him into the violent response I wishedâ€”I needed.

â€œWonâ€™t do what?â€ I was gasping.

â€œI willna punish ye for it,â€ he said, so softly I could barely hear him, close as he was. â€œIâ€™ll not do that, dâ€™ye hear?â€

â€œI donâ€™t frigging want you to punish me, you bastard.â€ I grunted with effort, my shoulder joints creaking as I tried to break free of his grasp. â€œI want you to . . . God, you know what I want!â€

â€œAye, I do.â€ His hand left my shoulder and cupped beneath my buttock, touching the flesh of our joining, stretched and slippery. I made a small sound of surrender, and my knees loosened.

He pulled back, then came back into me, strongly enough that I gave a small, high-pitched cry of relief.

â€œAsk me to your bed,â€ he said, breathless, hands on my arms. â€œI shall come to ye. For that matterâ€”I shall come, whether ye ask it or no. But remember, Sassenachâ€”I am your man; I serve ye as I will.â€

â€œDo,â€ I said. â€œPlease do. Jamie, I want you so!â€

He seized my arse in both hands, hard enough to leave bruises, and I arched up into him, grasping, hands sliding on his sweat-slick skin.

â€œGod, Claire, I need ye!â€

Rain was roaring on the tin roof now, and lightning struck close by, blue-white and sharp with ozone. We rode it together, forked and light-blind, breathless, and the thunder rolled through our bones.





GIVE ME LIBERTY . . .

AND AS THE SUN set on the third day since he had left his home, Lord John William Bertram Amstrong Grey found himself once more a free man, with a full belly, a swimming head, a badly mended musket, and severely chafed wrists, standing before the Reverend Peleg Woodsworth, right hand uplifted, reciting as prompted:

â€œI, Bertram Armstrong, swear to be true to the United States of America, and to serve them honestly and faithfully against all their enemies and opposers whatsoever, and to observe and obey the orders of the Continental Congress and the orders of the generals and officers set over me by them.â€

Bloody hell, he thought. What next?





PART TWO



Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch . . .





A STEP INTO THE DARK

October 30, 1980

Craigh na Dun

A BLOTCH OF SWEAT darkened the shirt between William Buccleighâ€™s shoulder blades; the day was cool, but it was a steep climb to the top of Craigh na Dunâ€”and the thought of what awaited them at the top was enough to make anybody sweat.

â€œYe havenâ€™t got to come,â€ Roger said to Buccleighâ€™s back.

â€œGet stuffed,â€ his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather replied briefly. Buck spoke absentmindedly, though, all his attention, like Rogerâ€™s, focused on the distant crest of the hill.

Roger could hear the stones from here. A low, sullen buzz, like a hive of hostile bees. He felt the sound move, crawling under his skin, and scratched viciously at his elbow, as though he could root it out.

â€œYeâ€™ve got the stones, aye?â€ Buck stopped, clinging one-handed to a birch sapling as he looked back over his shoulder.

â€œI have,â€ Roger said shortly. â€œDâ€™ye want yours now?â€

Buck shook his head and wiped shaggy fair hair off his brow with the back of his free hand.

â€œTime enough,â€ he said, and began to climb again.

Roger knew the diamonds were thereâ€”he knew Buck knew, tooâ€”but put a hand into his jacket pocket anyway. Two rough pieces of metal clinked together, the halves of an old brooch Brianna had cut apart with the poultry shears, each half with a scatter of tiny diamonds, barely more than chips. He hoped to God theyâ€™d be enough. If notâ€”

The day was only cool, but a bone-deep shudder ran through him. Heâ€™d done it twiceâ€”three times, if he counted the first attempt, the one that had almost killed him. It got worse each time. Heâ€™d thought he wouldnâ€™t make it the last time, coming back on Ocracoke, mind and body shredding in that place that was neither place nor passage. It had only been the feel of Jem in his arms that made him hold on, come through. And it was only the need to find Jem now that would make him do it again.



A hydroelectric tunnel

under the Loch Errochty dam

HE MUST BE getting near the end of the tunnel. Jem could tell by the way the air pushed back against his face. All he could see was the red light on the service trainâ€™s dashboardâ€”did you call it a dashboard on a train? he wondered. He didnâ€™t want to stop, because that meant heâ€™d have to get out of the train, into the dark. But the train was running out of track, so there wasnâ€™t much else he could do.

He pulled back a bit on the lever that made the train go, and it slowed down. More. Just a little more, and the lever clicked into a kind of slot and the train stopped with a small jerk that made him stumble and grab the edge of the cab.

An electric train didnâ€™t make any engine noise, but the wheels rattled on the track and the train made squeaks and clunks as it moved. When it stopped, the noise stopped, too. It was really quiet.

â€œHey!â€ he said out loud, because he didnâ€™t want to listen to his heart beating. The sound echoed, and he looked up, startled. Mam had said the tunnel was really high, more than thirty feet, but heâ€™d forgotten that. The idea that there was a lot of empty space hanging over him that he couldnâ€™t see bothered him a lot. He swallowed and stepped out of the tiny engine, holding on to the frame with one hand.

â€œHey!â€ he shouted at the invisible ceiling. â€œAre there any bats up there?â€

Silence. Heâ€™d kind of been hoping there were bats. He wasnâ€™t afraid of themâ€”there were bats in the old broch, and he liked to sit and watch them come out to hunt in the summer evenings. But he was alone. Except for the dark.

His hands were sweating. He let go of the metal cab and scrubbed both hands on his jeans. Now he could hear himself breathing, too.

â€œCrap,â€ he whispered under his breath. That made him feel better, so he said it again. Maybe he ought to be praying, instead, but he didnâ€™t feel like that, not yet.

There was a door, Mam said. At the end of the tunnel. It led into the service chamber, where the big turbines could be lifted up from the dam if they needed fixing. Would the door be locked?

Suddenly he realized that heâ€™d stepped away from the train and he didnâ€™t know whether he was facing the end of the tunnel or back the way heâ€™d come. In a panic, he blundered to and fro, hands out, looking for the train. He tripped over part of the track and fell, sprawling. He lay there for a second, saying, â€œCrap-crap-crap-crap-crap!â€ because heâ€™d skinned both knees and the palm of his hand, but he was okay, really, and now he knew where the track was, so he could follow it and not get lost.

He got up, wiped his nose, and shuffled slowly along, kicking the track every few steps to be sure he stayed with it. He thought he was in front of where the train had stopped, so it didnâ€™t really matter which way he was goingâ€”either heâ€™d find the train or heâ€™d find the end of the tunnel. And then the door. If it was locked, maybeâ€”

Something like an electric shock ran right through him. He gasped and fell over backward. The only thing in his mind was the idea that somebody had hit him with a lightsaber like Luke Skywalkerâ€™s, and for a minute he thought maybe whoever it was had cut off his head.

He couldnâ€™t feel his body, but he could see in his mind his body lying bleeding in the dark and his head sitting right there on the train tracks in the dark, and his head couldnâ€™t see his body or even know it wasnâ€™t attached anymore. He made a breathless kind of a noise that was trying to be a scream, but it made his stomach move and he felt that, he felt it, and suddenly he felt a lot more like praying.

â€œDeo . . . gratias!â€ he managed to gasp. It was what Grandda said when he talked about a fight or killing something, and this wasnâ€™t quite that sort of thing, but it seemed like a good thing to say anyway.

Now he could feel all of himself again, but he sat up and grabbed his neck, just to be sure his head was still on. His skin was jumping in the weirdest way. Like a horseâ€™s does when a horsefly bites it, but all over. He swallowed and tasted sugared silver and he gasped again, because now he knew what had hit him. Sort of.

This wasnâ€™t quite like it had been when theyâ€™d all walked into the rocks on Ocracoke. One minute heâ€™d been in his fatherâ€™s arms, and the next minute it was as if heâ€™d been scattered everywhere in little wiggly pieces like the spilled quicksilver in Grannieâ€™s surgery. Then he was back together again, and Da was still holding him tight enough to squeeze his breath out, and he could hear Da sobbing and that scared him, and he had a funny taste in his mouth and little pieces of him were still wiggling around trying to get away but they were trapped inside his skin . . .

Yeah. That was what was making his skin jump now, and he breathed easier, knowing what it was. That was okay, then; he was okay; it would stop.

It was stopping already, the twitchy feeling going away. He still felt kind of shaky, but he stood up. Careful, because he didnâ€™t know where it was.

Waitâ€”he did know. He knew exactly.

â€œThatâ€™s weird,â€ he said, out loud without really noticing, because he wasnâ€™t scared by the dark anymore; it wasnâ€™t important.

He couldnâ€™t see it, not with his eyes, not exactly. He squinted, trying to think how he was seeing it, but there wasnâ€™t a word for what he was doing. Kind of like hearing or smelling or touching, but not really any of those.

But he knew where it was. It was right there, a kind of . . . shiver . . . in the air, and when he stared at it, he had a feeling in the back of his mind like pretty sparkly things, like sun on the sea and the way a candle flame looked when it shone through a ruby, but he knew he wasnâ€™t really seeing anything like that.

It went all the way across the tunnel, and up to the high roof, too, he could tell. But it wasnâ€™t thick at all; it was thin as air.

He guessed that was why it hadnâ€™t swallowed him like the thing in the rocks on Ocracoke had. At least . . . he thought it hadnâ€™t and, for an instant, worried that maybe heâ€™d gone sometime else. But he didnâ€™t think so. The tunnel felt just the same, and so did he, now that his skin had stopped jumping. When theyâ€™d done it, on Ocracoke, heâ€™d known right away it was different.

He stood there for a minute, just looking and thinking, and then shook his head and turned around, feeling with his foot for the track. He wasnâ€™t going back through that, no matter what. Heâ€™d just have to hope the door wasnâ€™t locked.

The lairdâ€™s study,

Lallybroch estate

BRIANNAâ€™S HAND closed on the letter opener, but even as she calculated the distance involved, the obstacle of the desk between Rob Cameron and herself, and the flimsiness of the wooden blade, she was reluctantly concluding that she couldnâ€™t kill the bastard. Not yet.

â€œWhereâ€™s my son?â€

â€œHeâ€™s okay.â€

She stood up suddenly, and he jerked a little in reflex. His face flushed and he hardened his expression.

â€œHeâ€™d bloody well better be okay,â€ she snapped. â€œI said, where is he?â€

â€œOh, no, hen,â€ he said, rocking back on his heels, affecting nonchalance. â€œThatâ€™s no how weâ€™re playing it. Not tonight.â€

God, why didnâ€™t Roger keep a hammer or a chisel or something useful in his desk drawer? Did he expect her to staple this jerk? She braced herself, both hands flat on the desk, to keep from leaping over it and going for his throat.

â€œIâ€™m not playing,â€ she said through her teeth. â€œAnd neither are you. Whereâ€™s Jemmy?â€

He leveled a long finger at her.

â€œYouâ€™re no longer the boss lady, Ms. MacKenzie. I call the shots now.â€

â€œOh, you think so, do you?â€ she asked, as mildly as she could. Her thoughts were slipping past like grains of sand in an hourglass, a slithering cascade of what if, how, shall I, no, yes . . .

â€œI do, aye.â€ His color, already high, rose higher, and he licked his lips. â€œYeâ€™re gonna find out what itâ€™s like to be on the bottom, hen.â€

Cameronâ€™s eyes were very bright, and his hair was clipped so short that she could see beads of sweat glittering above his ears. Was he high on something? She thought not. He was wearing track pants, and his fingers flicked unconsciously across the front, where a substantial bulge was beginning to show. Her lips tightened at the sight.

Not on your life, buddy.

She widened her gaze as much as possible, to take him in without letting his eyes move from hers. She didnâ€™t think he was armed, though the pockets of his jacket had stuff in them. He really thought he could make her have sex with him, without a set of manacles and a sledgehammer?

He twirled his finger, pointing to the floor in front of him.

â€œCome round here, hen,â€ he said softly. â€œAnd take your jeans down. Might do ye good to learn what itâ€™s like to take it up the arse regularly. Yeâ€™ve done it to me for monthsâ€”fairâ€™s fair, isnâ€™t it?â€

Very slowly, she came around the desk but stopped well short of him, keeping out of reach. She fumbled cold-fingered at the button of her fly, unwilling to look down, unwilling to take her eyes off him. Her heart was beating so hard in her ears that she could barely hear his heavy breathing.



The tip of his tongue showed briefly, involuntarily, as she pushed the jeans down over her hips, and he swallowed.

â€œThe knickers, too,â€ he said, half breathless. â€œTake them off.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t rape people very often, do you?â€ she said rudely, stepping out of the puddled jeans. â€œWhatâ€™s your rush?â€ She bent and picked the heavy denim pants up, shook out the legs, and turned as though to lay them on the desk. Then whipped back, clutching the jeans at the ankle, and lashed them as hard as she could at his head.

The heavy cloth with its zipper and brass fly button struck him full in the face, and he staggered back with a grunt of surprise, clutching at the jeans. She let go of them instantly, leapt onto the desk, and launched herself at him, shoulder-first.

They fell together with a crash that shook the hardwood floor, but she landed on top, kneed him hard in the belly, and then grabbed him by both ears and thumped his head on the floor as hard as she could. He let out a cry of pain, reached for her wrists, and she promptly let go of his ears, leaned backward, and grabbed for his crotch.

Had she been able to get a decent grip on his balls through the soft fabric, she would have crushed them. As it was, she managed a glancing squeeze but one hard enough to make him yelp and convulse, nearly dislodging her from her perch.

She couldnâ€™t win a fistfight. Couldnâ€™t let him hit her. She scrambled to her feet, looking wildly round the office for something heavy to hit him with, seized the wooden letter box, and smashed it over his head as he started to rise. He didnâ€™t fall down but bobbed his head, dazed amongst the cascade of letters, and she kicked him in the jaw as hard as she could, her own teeth clenched. It was a sliding, sweaty impact, but sheâ€™d hurt him.

Sheâ€™d hurt herself, too, had kicked him with her heel, as much as she could, but she felt a burst of pain in the middle of her foot; sheâ€™d torn or broken something, but it didnâ€™t matter.

Cameron shook his head violently, trying to clear it. He was on his hands and knees now, crawling toward her, reaching for her leg, and she backed up against the desk. With a banshee shriek, she kneed him in the face, squirmed out of his grasp, and ran for the hall, limping heavily.

There were weapons on the walls of the foyer, a few targes and broadswords kept for ornament, but all hung high, to be out of the childrenâ€™s reach. There was a better one easily to hand, though. She reached behind the coat rack and grabbed Jemâ€™s cricket bat.

You canâ€™t kill him, she kept thinking, dimly surprised at the fact that her mind was still working. Donâ€™t kill him. Not yet. Not â€™til he says where Jemmy is.

â€œFucking . . . bitch!â€ He was nearly on her, panting, half blinded by blood running down his forehead, half sobbing through the blood pouring from his nose. â€œFuck you, split you open, fuck you up theâ€”â€

â€œCaisteal DOOON!â€ she bellowed, and, stepping out from behind the coat rack, swung the bat in a scything arc that caught him in the ribs. He made a gurgling noise and folded, arms across his middle. She took a deep breath, swung the bat as high as she could, and brought it down with all her strength on the crown of his head.



The shock of it vibrated up her arms to her shoulders and she dropped the bat with a clunk and stood there gasping, trembling and drenched with sweat.

â€œMummy?â€ said a tiny, quavering voice from the foot of the stair. â€œWhy is you not got pants on, Mummy?â€



THANK GOD FOR instinct was her first coherent thought. Sheâ€™d crossed the length of the foyer, snatched Mandy up in her arms, and was patting her comfortingly before any sort of conscious decision to move had been made.

â€œPants?â€ she said, eyeing the limp form of Rob Cameron. He hadnâ€™t twitched since heâ€™d fallen, but she didnâ€™t think sheâ€™d killed him. Sheâ€™d have to take more-certain steps to neutralize him, and fast. â€œOh, pants. I was just getting ready for bed when this naughty man showed up.â€

â€œOh.â€ Mandy leaned out of her arms, peering at Cameron. â€œIss Mr. Rob! Iss a burglar? Iss a bad man?â€

â€œYes, both,â€ Brianna said, deliberately casual. Mandyâ€™s speech showed the sibilance it had when she got excited or upset, but the little girl seemed to be recovering pretty fast from the shock of seeing her mother crown a burglar in the front hall while wearing only a T-shirt and underpants. The thought made her want to stomp on Cameronâ€™s balls, but she choked it back. No time for that.

Mandy clung to her neck, but Brianna set her firmly on the stairs.

â€œMummy wants you to stay here, a ghraidh. I have to put Mr. Rob someplace safe, where he canâ€™t do anything bad.â€

â€œNo!â€ Mandy cried, seeing her mother head toward the crumpled Cameron, but Brianna waved in what she hoped was a reassuring manner, picked up the cricket bat as insurance, and nudged her prisoner in the ribs with a cautious toe. He wobbled but didnâ€™t stir. Just in case, she moved round behind him and prodded him rudely between the buttocks with the cricket bat, which made Mandy giggle. He didnâ€™t move, and she drew a deep breath for the first time in what seemed like hours.

Going back to the stairs, she gave Mandy the bat to hold and smiled at her. She pushed a strand of sweaty hair behind her ear.

â€œOkay. Weâ€™re going to put Mr. Rob in the priestâ€™s hole. You go and open the door for Mummy, all right?â€

â€œI hit him?â€ Mandy asked hopefully, clutching the bat.

â€œNo, I donâ€™t think you need to do that, darling. Just open the door.â€

Her work tote was hanging from the coat rack, the big roll of duct tape easily to hand. She trussed Cameronâ€™s ankles and wrists, a dozen turns each, then bent and, clutching him by the ankles, dragged him toward the swinging baize door at the far end of the hall, which separated the kitchen from the rest of the house.

He began to stir as they negotiated the big table in the kitchen, and she dropped his feet.

â€œMandy,â€ she said, keeping her voice as calm as possible. â€œI need to have a grown-up talk with Mr. Rob. Give me the bat. Then you go right on out to the mudroom and wait for me there, okay?â€

â€œMummy . . .â€ Mandy was shrinking back against the sink cabinet, eyes huge and fixed on the moaning Cameron.

â€œGo, Mandy. Right now. Mummy will be there before you can count to a hundred. Start counting now. One . . . two . . . three . . .â€ She moved between Cameron and Mandy, motioning firmly with her free hand.

Reluctantly, Mandy moved, murmuring, â€œFour . . . five . . . six . . . seven . . .â€ and disappeared through the back kitchen door. The kitchen was warm from the Aga, and despite her lack of clothes, Bree was still streaming with sweat. She could smell herself, feral and acrid, and found that it made her feel stronger. She wasnâ€™t sure sheâ€™d ever truly understood the term â€œbloodthirstyâ€ before, but she did now.

â€œWhereâ€™s my son?â€ she said to Cameron, keeping a wary distance in case he tried to roll at her. â€œAnswer me, you piece of crap, or Iâ€™ll beat the shit out of you and then call the police.â€

â€œYeah?â€ He rolled slowly onto his side, groaning. â€œAnd tell them what, exactly? That I took your boy? What proof of that dâ€™ye have?â€ His words were slurred; his lip was puffed out on one side, where sheâ€™d kicked him.

â€œFine,â€ she snapped. â€œIâ€™ll just beat the shit out of you.â€

â€œWhat, beat a helpless man? Fine example for your wee lassie.â€ He rolled onto his back with a muffled grunt.

â€œAs for the police, I can tell them you broke into my house and assaulted me.â€ She pointed one foot at him, so he could see the livid scratches on her leg. â€œYouâ€™ll have my skin cells under your fingernails. And while Iâ€™d rather not have Mandy go through it all again, sheâ€™d certainly tell them what you were saying in the hallway.â€ She would, too, Bree thought. Mandy was a very faithful tape recorder, especially where bad language was concerned.

â€œNng.â€ Cameron had closed his eyes, grimacing against the light over the sink, but now opened them again. He was less dazed; she could see the light of calculation back in his eyes. Like most men, she thought, he was probably smarter when he wasnâ€™t sexually arousedâ€”and sheâ€™d taken care of that.

â€œAye. And I tell them it was just a wee sex game that got out of hand, and you say it wasnâ€™t, and they say, â€˜Aye, fine, missus, and whereâ€™s your husband, then?â€™â€ The undamaged side of his mouth twisted up. â€œYouâ€™re not that swift tonight, hen. But, then, yeâ€™re not usually.â€

His mention of Roger made the blood surge in her ears. She didnâ€™t reply but grabbed him by the feet and pulled him roughly through the kitchen and into the back passageway. The grating that covered the priestâ€™s hole was hidden by a bench and several boxes of milk bottles, bits of farm equipment awaiting repair, and other items that didnâ€™t go anywhere else. She dropped Robâ€™s feet, shoved the bench and boxes aside, and pulled up the grating. There was a ladder leading down into the shadowy space; she pulled this up and slid it behind the bench. That little amenity wouldnâ€™t be needed.

â€œHey!â€ Robâ€™s eyes widened. Either he hadnâ€™t known there really was a priestâ€™s hole in the house or he hadnâ€™t thought sheâ€™d do it. Without a word, she seized him under the arms, dragged him to the hole, and shoved him in. Feetfirst, because if he broke his neck, he couldnâ€™t tell her where Jem was.



He fell with a shriek, which was cut short by a heavy thump. Before she could worry that heâ€™d managed to land on his head after all, she heard him moaning and a rustle as he started to stir. A muttering of very bad language further reassured her that he was in good enough shape to answer questions. She fetched the big flashlight from the kitchen drawer and shone it down into the hole. Cameronâ€™s face, congested and streaked with blood, glared up at her. He curled up and with some difficulty managed to wriggle into a sitting position.

â€œYouâ€™ve broken my leg, you fucking bitch!â€

â€œGood,â€ she said coldly, though she doubted it. â€œOnce I get Jem back, Iâ€™ll take you to a doctor.â€

He breathed heavily through his nose, making a nasty snuffling noise, and swiped at his face with his bound hands, smearing the blood across one cheek.

â€œYou want him back? You get me out of here, and fast!â€

Sheâ€™d been consideringâ€”and discardingâ€”different plans of action, shuffling through them like a mental pack of cards, ever since sheâ€™d duct-taped him. And letting him out wasnâ€™t one sheâ€™d considered. She had thought of fetching the .22 rifle the family used to hunt rats and winging him in a few nonessential placesâ€”but there was some risk of either disabling him too badly to be of help or killing him accidentally by hitting something vital if he squirmed.

â€œThink fast,â€ he shouted up at her. â€œYour wee lass will hit a hundred and be back any second!â€

Despite the situation, Brianna smiled. Mandy had very recently been introduced to the idea that numbers were infinite and had been enchanted by the concept. She wouldnâ€™t stop counting until she ran out of breath or someone stopped her. Still, she wasnâ€™t going to engage in pointless conversation with her prisoner.

â€œOkay,â€ she said, and reached for the grate. â€œWeâ€™ll see how talkative you are after twenty-four hours without food or water, shall we?â€

â€œYou bloody bitch!â€ He tried to surge to his feet but fell over onto his side, writhing impotently. â€œYouâ€”you just think about this, aye? If Iâ€™m without food and water, soâ€™s your wee lad!â€

She froze, the metal edge of the grate digging into her fingers.

â€œRob, youâ€™re not bright,â€ she said. She was amazed that her voice sounded conversational; waves of horror and relief and renewed horror were rippling across her shoulders, and something primitive in the back of her mind was screaming.

A sullen silence from below, as he tried to work out what heâ€™d just given away.

â€œNow I know you didnâ€™t send Jem back through the stones,â€ she clarified for him. She carefully didnâ€™t shriek, But you sent Roger back to look for him! And heâ€™ll never find him. You . . . you . . . â€œHeâ€™s still here, in this time.â€

Another silence.

â€œYeah,â€ he said slowly. â€œOkay, you know that. But you donâ€™t know where he is. And youâ€™re not going to, until you turn me loose. I meant it, henâ€”heâ€™ll be thirsty by now. And hungry. Itâ€™ll be a lot worse for him by morning.â€

Her hand tightened on the grate. â€œYou had better be lying,â€ she said evenly. â€œFor your sake.â€ She shoved the grate back into place and stepped on it, clicking it down into its frame. The priestâ€™s hole was literally a hole: a space about six feet by eight, and twelve feet deep. Even if Rob Cameron hadnâ€™t been bound hand and foot, he couldnâ€™t jump high enough to get hold of the grate, let alone reach the latch that held it down.

Ignoring the furious shouts from below, Brianna went to retrieve her daughter and her jeans.



THE MUDROOM WAS empty, and for an instant she panickedâ€”but then she saw the tiny bare foot sticking out from under the bench, long toes relaxed as a frogâ€™s, and her heart rate dropped. A little.

Mandy was curled up under Rogerâ€™s old mac, thumb half in her mouth, sound asleep. The impulse was to carry her to her bed, let her sleep â€™til daylight. Brianna laid a soft hand on her daughterâ€™s black curly hairâ€”black as Rogerâ€™sâ€”and her heart squeezed like a lemon. There was another child to consider.

â€œWake up, sweetheart,â€ she said, gently shaking the little girl. â€œWake up, honey. We need to go and look for Jem.â€

It took no little cajoling and the administration of a glass of Coca-Colaâ€”a rare treat, and absolutely unheard of so late at night, how exciting!â€”to get Mandy into a state of alertness, but once there she was all eagerness to go and hunt for her brother.

â€œMandy,â€ Bree said as casually as she could, buttoning her daughterâ€™s pink quilted coat, â€œcan you feel Jem? Right now?â€

â€œUh-huh,â€ Mandy replied offhandedly, and Briannaâ€™s heart leapt. Two nights before, the child had waked screaming from a sound sleep, weeping hysterically and insisting that Jem was gone. She had been inconsolable, wailing that her brother had been eaten by â€œbig wocks!â€â€”an assertion that had terrified her parents, who knew the horrors of those particular rocks all too well.

But then, a few minutes later, Mandy had suddenly calmed. Jem was there, she said. He was there in her head. And she had gone back to sleep as though nothing had happened.

In the consternation that had followed this episodeâ€”the discovery that Jem had been taken by Rob Cameron, one of Briannaâ€™s fellow employees at the hydroelectric plant, and presumably taken through the stones into the pastâ€”there had been no time to recall Mandyâ€™s remark about Jem being back in her head, let alone to make further inquiries. But now Briannaâ€™s mind was moving at the speed of light, bounding from one horrifying realization to the next, making connections that might have taken hours to make in cooler blood.

Horrifying Realization Number 1: Jem hadnâ€™t gone into the past, after all. While by itself this was undeniably a good thing, it made Horrifying Realization Number 2 that much worse: Roger and William Buccleigh had undoubtedly gone through the stones, searching for Jemmy. She hoped they were in fact in the past and not deadâ€”traveling through whatever sort of thing the stones were was a bloody dangerous propositionâ€”but, if so, that brought her back to Horrifying Realization Number 1: Jem wasnâ€™t in the past. And if he wasnâ€™t there, Roger wasnâ€™t going to find him. And since Roger would never give up looking . . .

She pushed Horrifying Realization Number 3 aside with great force, and Mandy blinked, startled.

â€œWhy you making faces, Mummy?â€

â€œPracticing for Halloween.â€ She rose, smiling as best she could, and reached for her own duffel coat.

Mandyâ€™s brow creased in thought.

â€œWhenâ€™s Halloween?â€

Cold rippled over Brianna, and not just from the draft through the crack under the back door. Did they make it? They thought the portal was most active on the sun feasts and fire feastsâ€”and Samhain was an important fire feastâ€”but they couldnâ€™t wait the extra day, for fear that Jem would be taken too far from Craigh na Dun after passing through the stones.

â€œTomorrow,â€ she said. Her fingers slipped and fumbled on the fastenings, shaky with adrenaline.

â€œGoody, goody, goody!â€ Mandy said, hopping to and fro like a cricket. â€œCan I wear my mask to look for Jemmy?â€





NOTHINGâ€™S SO HARD BUT SEARCH WILL FIND IT OUT

HEâ€™D FELT THE DIAMONDS explode. For some time, that was the only thought in his mind. Felt it. One instant, briefer than a heartbeat, and a pulse of light and heat in his hand and then the throb of something going through him, surrounding him, and then . . .

Not â€œthen,â€ he thought muzzily. Wasnâ€™t any then. Wasnâ€™t any now. Now there is, though . . .

He opened his eyes to find that there was a now. He was lying on stones and heather and there was a cow breathingâ€”no, not a cow. He made to rise and managed to turn his head half an inch. It was a man, sitting huddled on the ground. Taking huge, irregular, gasping sobs of breath. Who . . . ?

â€œOh,â€ he said aloud, or almost. â€œ â€™S you.â€ The words came out in a mangle that hurt his throat, and he coughed. That hurt, too. â€œYou . . . okay?â€ he asked hoarsely.



â€œNo.â€ It came out in a grunt, filled with pain, and alarm got Roger up onto hands and knees, head spinning. He did a bit of gasping himself but crawled as fast as he could toward Buck.

William Buccleigh was curled over, arms crossed, gripping his left upper arm with his right hand. His face was pale and slicked with sweat, lips pressed so tight together that a ring of white showed round his mouth.

â€œHurt?â€ Roger lifted a hand, not sure where or whether to prod. He couldnâ€™t see any blood.

â€œMy . . . chest,â€ Buck wheezed. â€œArm.â€

â€œOh, Jesus,â€ Roger said, the last remnants of muzziness stripped away by a blast of adrenaline. â€œAre you having a bloody heart attack?â€

â€œWhat . . .â€ Buck grimaced, then something seemed to ease a little. He gulped air. â€œHow would I know?â€

â€œItâ€™sâ€”never mind. Lie down, will you?â€ Roger looked wildly round, though even as he did, he realized the sheer pointlessness of doing so. The area near Craigh na Dun was wild and unpopulated in his own time, let alone this one. And even should someone appear out of the stones and heather, the chances of whoever it was being a doctor were remote.

He took Buck by the shoulders and eased him gently down, then bent and put his ear to the manâ€™s chest, feeling like an idiot.

â€œDâ€™ye hear anything?â€ Buck asked anxiously.

â€œNot with you talking, no. Shut up.â€ He thought he could make out a heartbeat of some sort but had no idea whether there was anything wrong with it. He stayed bent a moment longer, if only to compose himself.

Always act as if you know what youâ€™re doing, even if you donâ€™t. Heâ€™d been given that bit of advice by a number of people, from performers heâ€™d shared a stage with to academic advisers . . . and, much more recently, by both of his in-laws.

He put a hand on Buckâ€™s chest and looked into the manâ€™s face. He was still sweating and plainly scared, but there was a little more color in his cheeks. His lips werenâ€™t blue; that seemed a good sign.

â€œJust keep breathing,â€ he advised his ancestor. â€œSlow, aye?â€

He tried to follow that bit of advice himself; his own heart was hammering and sweat was running down his back, in spite of a cold wind that whined past his ears.

â€œWe did it, aye?â€ Buckâ€™s chest was moving more slowly under his hand. He turned his head to look round. â€œItâ€™s . . . different. Isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œYes.â€ In spite of the current situation and the overwhelming worry for Jem, Roger felt a surge of jubilation and relief. It was different: from here, he could see the road belowâ€”now no more than an overgrown droversâ€™ trace rather than a gray asphalt ribbon. The trees and bushes, they were different, tooâ€”there were pines, the big Caledonian pines that looked like giant stalks of broccoli. They had made it.

He grinned at Buck. â€œWe made it. Donâ€™t die on me now, you bugger.â€

â€œDo my best.â€ Buck was gruff but maybe starting to look better. â€œWhat happens if ye die out of your time? Dâ€™ye just disappear, like ye never were?â€

â€œMaybe ye explode into bits. I donâ€™t know, and I donâ€™t want to find out. Not while Iâ€™m standing next to you, at least.â€ Roger got his feet under him and fought down a wave of dizziness. His own heart was still beating hard enough that he felt it in the back of his head. He breathed as deep as he could and stood up.

â€œIâ€™ll . . . get ye some water. Stay there, aye?â€



ROGER HAD BROUGHT a small empty canteen, though heâ€™d worried about what might happen to the metal in transit. Evidently whatever it was that vaporized gemstones wasnâ€™t bothered about tin, though; the canteen was intact, and so was the small knife and the silver pocket flask of brandy.

Buck was sitting up by the time Roger came back from the nearest burn with water, and after mopping his face with the water and drinking half the brandy, he declared himself recovered.

Roger wasnâ€™t all that sure; the look of the man was a little off-color stillâ€”but he was much too anxious about Jem to suggest waiting any longer. Theyâ€™d talked about it a bit on the drive to Craigh na Dun, agreeing on a basic strategy, at least to start.

If Cameron and Jem had made it through without mishapâ€”and Rogerâ€™s heart misgave him at that thought, recalling Geillis Duncanâ€™s careful collection of news reports involving people found near stone circles, most of them deadâ€”they had to be on foot. And while Jem was a sturdy little boy and capable of walking a good distance, he doubted they could make much more than ten miles in a day over rough country.

The only road was the droversâ€™ track that led near the base of the hill. So one of them would take the direction that would intersect with one of General Wadeâ€™s good roads that led to Inverness; the other would follow the track west toward the pass that led to Lallybroch and, beyond it, Cranesmuir.

â€œI think Inverness is the most likely,â€ Roger repeated, probably for the sixth time. â€œItâ€™s the gold he wants, and he knows thatâ€™s in America. He canâ€™t be meaning to walk from the Highlands to Edinburgh to find a ship, not with winter breathing down his neck.â€

â€œHe wonâ€™t find a ship anywhere in the winter,â€ Buck objected. â€œNo captain would cross the Atlantic in November!â€

â€œDâ€™ye think he knows that?â€ Roger asked. â€œHeâ€™s an amateur archaeologist, not a historian. And most folk in the twentieth century have trouble thinking anything was ever different in the past, save the funny clothes and no indoor plumbing. The notion that the weather could stop them going anywhere theyâ€™d a mind toâ€”he may well think ships run all the time, on a regular timetable.â€

â€œMmphm. Well, maybe he means to hole up in Inverness with the lad, maybe find work, and wait â€™til the spring. Dâ€™ye want to take Inverness, then?â€ Buck lifted his chin in the direction of the invisible town.

â€œNo.â€ Roger shook his head and began patting his pockets, checking his supplies. â€œJem knows this place.â€ He nodded toward the stones above them. â€œI brought him here, more than once, to make sure he never came upon it unawares. That means he knowsâ€”approximately, at leastâ€”how to get homeâ€”to Lallybroch, I meanâ€”from here. If he got away from Cameronâ€”and, God, I hope he did!â€”heâ€™d run for home.â€

He didnâ€™t trouble saying that even if Jem wasnâ€™t there, Briannaâ€™s relatives were, her cousins and her aunt. Heâ€™d not met them, but they knew from Jamieâ€™s letters who he was; if Jem wasnâ€™t thereâ€”and, Lord, how he hoped he wasâ€”theyâ€™d help him search. As to how much he might try to tell them . . . that could wait.

â€œRight, then.â€ Buck buttoned his coat and settled the knitted comforter round his neck against the wind. â€œThree days, maybe, to Inverness and time to search the town, two or three back. Iâ€™ll meet ye here in six daysâ€™ time. If yeâ€™re not here, I follow on to Lallybroch.â€

Roger nodded. â€œAnd if Iâ€™ve not found them but Iâ€™ve heard some word of them, Iâ€™ll leave a message at Lallybroch. If . . .â€ He hesitated, but it had to be said. â€œIf ye find your wife, and things fall outâ€”â€

Buckâ€™s lips tightened.

â€œTheyâ€™ve already fallen,â€ he said. â€œBut, aye. If. Iâ€™ll still come back.â€

â€œAye, right.â€ Roger hunched his shoulders, anxious to go, and awkward with it. Buck was already turning away but suddenly about-faced and gripped Rogerâ€™s hand, hard.

â€œWeâ€™ll find him,â€ Buck said, and looked into Rogerâ€™s eyes, with those bright-moss eyes that were the same as his. â€œGood luck.â€ He gave Rogerâ€™s hand one sharp, hard shake and then was off, arms outstretched for balance as he picked his way down through the rocks and gorse. He didnâ€™t look back.





WARMER, COLDER

â€œCAN YOU TELL when Jemâ€™s at school?â€

â€œYes. He goes on da bus.â€ Mandy bounced a little on her booster seat, leaning to peer out the window. She was wearing the Halloween mask Bree had helped her make, this being a mouse princess: a mouse face drawn with crayons on a paper plate, with holes pierced for eyes and at either side for pink yarn ties, pink pipe cleaners glued on for whiskers, and a precarious small crown made with cardboard, more glue, and most of a bottle of gold glitter.

Scots celebrated Samhain with hollowed-out turnips with candles in them, but Brianna had wanted a slightly more festive tradition for her half-American children. The whole seat sparkled as though the car had been sprinkled with pixie dust.

She smiled, despite her worry.

â€œI meant, if you played warmer, colder with Jem, could you do it if he wasnâ€™t answering you out loud? Would you know if he was closer or farther away?â€

Mandy kicked the back of the seat in meditative fashion.

â€œMaybe.â€

â€œCan you try?â€ They were headed toward Inverness. That was where Jem was supposed to be, spending the night with Rob Cameronâ€™s nephew.

â€œOkay,â€ Mandy said agreeably. She hadnâ€™t asked where Rob Cameron was. Brianna spared a thought as to the fate of her prisoner. She really would shoot him through the ankles, elbows, knees, or anything else necessary to find out where Jem wasâ€”but if there were quieter ways of interrogation, it would be better all round. It wouldnâ€™t be good for Jem and Mandy to have their mother sent to prison for life, particularly if Rogerâ€”She choked that thought off and stepped harder on the gas.

â€œColder,â€ Mandy announced, so suddenly that Brianna nearly stalled the car.

â€œWhat? Do you mean weâ€™re getting farther away from where Jemmy is?â€

â€œUh-huh.â€

Brianna took a deep breath and made a U-turn, narrowly avoiding an oncoming panel truck, which hooted at them in annoyance.

â€œRight,â€ she said, gripping the wheel with sweaty hands. â€œWeâ€™ll go the other way.â€



THE DOOR WASNâ€™T locked. Jem opened it, heart pounding in relief, and then it pounded harder, as he realized the lights werenâ€™t on in the turbine chamber, either.

There was some light. The little windows up at the top of the huge space, up where the engineersâ€™ room was: there was light coming from there. Just enough so he could see the monsters in the huge room.

â€œTheyâ€™re just machines,â€ he muttered, pressing his back hard against the wall beside the open door. â€œJustmachinesjustmachinesjustmachines!â€ He knew the names of them, the giant pulley hoists that ran overhead with the big hooks dangling, and the turbines, Mam had told him. But heâ€™d been up there then, where the light was, and it had been daylight.

The floor under his feet vibrated, and he could feel the knobs on his backbone knocking against the wall as it shook from the weight of the water rushing through the dam under him. Tons of water, Mummy said. Tons and tons and tons of black dark water, all around him, under him . . . If the wall or the floor broke, itâ€”

â€œShut up, baby!â€ he said fiercely to himself, and rubbed his hand hard over his face and wiped it on his jeans. â€œYou got to move. Go!â€

There were stairs; there had to be stairs. And they were somewhere in here, among the big black humps of the turbines that poked up. They stood higher than the big stones on the hill where Mr. Cameron had taken him. That thought calmed him down some; he was lots more scared of the stones. Even with the deep roaring noise the turbines madeâ€”that was making his bones twitch, but it didnâ€™t really get inside his bones.

The only thing that kept him from going right back into the tunnel and hoping for someone to find him in the morning was the . . . thing in there. He didnâ€™t want to be anywhere near that.

He couldnâ€™t hear his heart anymore. It was too noisy in the turbine chamber to hear anything. He sure couldnâ€™t hear himself think, but the stairs had to be near the windows, and he wobbled that way, keeping as far as he could from the huge black double humps sticking up through the floor.

It was only when he finally found the door, yanked it open, and fell into the lighted staircase that it occurred to him to wonder whether Mr. Cameron was maybe up there, waiting for him.





RETURN TO LALLYBROCH

ROGER HAULED HIS WAY laboriously toward the summit of the mountain pass, muttering under his breath (as he had been doing for the last several miles):

â€œIf you had seen this road before it was made,

You would lift up your hands and bless General Wade.â€



The Irish General Wade had spent twelve years building barracks, bridges, and roads all over Scotland, and if that bit of admiring verse was not in fact carved into a stone on one of the generalâ€™s roads, it ought to have been, Roger thought. He had picked up one of the generalâ€™s roads near Craigh na Dun, and it had carried him as swiftly as he could walk to within a few miles of Lallybroch.

These last few miles, though, had not had the benefit of Wadeâ€™s attention. A rocky trail, pitted with small mud bogs and thickly overgrown with heather and gorse, led up through the steep pass that overlookedâ€”and protectedâ€”Lallybroch. The lower slopes were forested with beeches, alders, and stout Caledonian pines, but up this high there was neither shade nor shelter, and a strong, cold wind battered him as he climbed.



Could Jem have come this far by himself, if heâ€™d escaped? Roger and Buck had cast round in the vicinity of Craigh na Dun, hoping that perhaps Cameron had stopped to rest after the strain of the passage, but there had been no signâ€”not so much as the print of a size-4 trainer in a muddy patch of ground. Roger had come on then by himself, as fast as he could, pausing to knock at the door of any croft he came toâ€”and there werenâ€™t many along this wayâ€”but heâ€™d made good time.

His heart was pounding, and not only from the exertion of the climb. Cameron had maybe a two-day lead, at the most. If Jem hadnâ€™t got away and run for home, though . . . Cameron wouldnâ€™t come to Lallybroch, surely. But where would he go? Follow the good road, left now ten miles behind, and head west, maybe, into the MacKenziesâ€™ territoryâ€”but why?

â€œJem!â€ He shouted now and then as he went, though the moors and mountains were empty save for the rustling of rabbits and stoats and silent but for the calling of ravens and the occasional shriek of a seagull winging high overhead, evidence of the distant sea.

â€œJem!â€ he called, as though he could compel an answer by sheer need, and in that need imagined sometimes that he heard a faint cry in response. But when he stopped to listen, it was the wind. Only the wind, whining in his ears, numbing him. He could walk within ten feet of Jem and never see him, and he knew that.

His heart rose, in spite of his anxiety, when he came to the top of the pass and saw Lallybroch below him, its white-harled buildings glowing in the fading light. Everything lay peaceful before him: late cabbages and turnips in orderly rows within the kailyard walls, safe from grazing sheepâ€”there was a small flock in the far meadow, already bedding for the night, like so many woolly eggs in a nest of green grass, like a kidâ€™s Easter basket.

The thought caught at his throat, with memories of the horrible cellophane grass that got everywhere, Mandy with her faceâ€”and everything else within six feet of herâ€”smeared with chocolate, Jem carefully writing Dad on a hard-boiled egg with a white crayon, then frowning over the array of dye cups, trying to decide whether blue or purple was more Dad-like.

â€œLord, let him be here!â€ he muttered under his breath, and hurried down the rutted trail, half sliding on loose rocks.

The dooryard was tidy, the big yellow rose brier trimmed back for the winter, and the step swept clean. He had the sudden notion that if he were simply to open the door and walk in, he would find himself in his own lobby, Mandyâ€™s tiny red galoshes flung helter-skelter under the hall tree where Briannaâ€™s disreputable duffel coat hung, crusty with dried mud and smelling of its wearer, soap and musk and the faint smell of her motherhood: sour milk, fresh bread, and peanut butter.

â€œBloody hell,â€ he muttered, â€œbe weeping on the step, next thing.â€ He hammered at the door, and a huge dog came galloping round the corner of the house, baying like the bloody hound of the Baskervilles. It slid to a stop in front of him but went on barking, weaving its huge head to and fro like a snake, ears cocked in case he might make a false move that would let it devour him with a clear conscience.



He wasnâ€™t risking any moves; heâ€™d plastered himself against the door when the dog appeared and now shouted, â€œHelp! Come call your beast!â€

He heard footsteps within, and an instant later the door opened, nearly decanting him into the hall.

â€œHauld your wheesht, dog,â€ a tall, dark man said in a tolerant tone. â€œCome ben, sir, and dinna be minding him. He wouldna eat you; heâ€™s had his dinner.â€

â€œIâ€™m pleased to hear it, sir, and thank ye kindly.â€ Roger pulled off his hat and followed the man into the shadows of the hall. It was his own familiar hall, the slates of the floor just the same, though not nearly as worn, the dark-wood paneling shining with beeswax and polishing. There was a hall tree in the corner, though of course different to his; this one was a sturdy affair of wrought iron, and a good thing, too, as it was supporting a massive burden of jackets, shawls, cloaks, and hats, which would have crumpled a flimsier piece of furniture.

He smiled at it, nonetheless, and then stopped dead, feeling as though heâ€™d been punched in the chest.

The wood paneling behind the hall tree shone serene, unblemished. No sign of the saber slashes left by frustrated redcoat soldiers searching for the outlawed laird of Lallybroch after Culloden. Those slashes had been carefully preserved for centuries, were still there, darkened by age but still distinct, when he had ownedâ€”would own, he corrected mechanicallyâ€”this place.

â€œWe keep it so for the children,â€ Bree had quoted her uncle Ian as saying. â€œWe tell them, â€˜This is what the English are.â€™â€

He had no time to deal with the shock; the dark man had shut the door with a firm Gaelic adjuration to the dog and now turned to him, smiling.

â€œWelcome, sir. Yeâ€™ll sup wiâ€™ us? The lass has it nearly ready.â€

â€œAye, I will, and thanks to ye,â€ Roger bowed slightly, groping for his eighteenth-century manners. â€œIâ€”my name is Roger MacKenzie. Of Kyle of Lochalsh,â€ he added, for no respectable man would omit to note his origins, and Lochalsh was far enough away that the chances of this manâ€”who was he? He hadnâ€™t the bearing of a servantâ€”knowing its inhabitants in any detail was remote.

Heâ€™d hoped that the immediate response would be, â€œMacKenzie? Why, you must be the father of wee Jem!â€ It wasnâ€™t, though; the man returned his bow and offered his hand.

â€œBrian Fraser of Lallybroch, your servant, sir.â€



ROGER FELT ABSOLUTELY nothing for a moment. There was a faint clicking that reminded him of the noise a carâ€™s starter makes when the battery is dead, and for a disoriented moment he assumed it was being made by his brain. Then his eyes focused on the dog, which, prevented from eating him, had come into the house and was walking down the passage, its toenails clicking on the parquet floor.

Oh. So thatâ€™s what left those scratches on the kitchen door, he thought, dazed, as the beast reared up and heaved its weight at the swinging door at the end of the passage, then shot through as it opened.

â€œAre ye quite well, sir?â€ Brian Fraser was looking at him, thick black brows drawn down in concern. He reached out a hand. â€œCome into my study and sit. Iâ€™ll maybe fetch ye a dram?â€

â€œIâ€”thank you,â€ Roger said abruptly. He thought his knees might give way at any second, but he managed to follow the master of Lallybroch into the speak-a-word room, the lairdâ€™s office and study. His own study.

The shelves were the same, and behind his hostâ€™s head was the same row of farm ledgers that heâ€™d often thumbed through, conjuring up from their faded entries the phantom life of an earlier Lallybroch. Now the ledgers were new, and Roger felt himself the phantom. He didnâ€™t like the feeling at all.

Brian Fraser handed him a small, thick, flat-bottomed glass half full of spirit. Whisky, and very decent whisky, too. The smell of it began to bring him out of his shock, and the warm burn of it down his gullet loosened the tightness in his throat.

How was he to ask what he so desperately needed to know? When?! He glanced over the desk, but there was no half-finished letter, conveniently dated, no planting almanac that he might glance casually through. None of the books on the shelf were of help; the only one he recognized was Defoeâ€™s THE LIFE AND STRANGE SURPRIZING ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, OF YORK, MARINER, and that had been published in 1719. He knew he must be later than that; the house itself hadnâ€™t yet been built in 1719.

He forced down the rising tide of panic. It didnâ€™t matter; it didnâ€™t matter if it wasnâ€™t the time heâ€™d expectedâ€”not if Jem was here. And he must be. He must be.

â€œIâ€™m sorry to disturb your family, sir,â€ he said, clearing his throat as he set down the glass. â€œBut the fact is that Iâ€™ve lost my son and am in search of him.â€

â€œLost your son!â€ exclaimed Fraser, eyes widening in surprise. â€œBride be with ye, sir. How did that come about?â€

Just as well to tell the truth where he could, he thought, and, after all, what else could he say?

â€œHe was kidnapped two days ago and carried awayâ€”heâ€™s no but nine years old. I have some reason to think the man who took him comes from this area. Have ye by chance seen a tall man, lean and dark, traveling with a young red-haired lad, about so tall?â€ He put the edge of his hand against his own arm, about three inches above the elbow; Jem was tall for his age and even taller for this ageâ€”but, then, Brian Fraser was a tall man himself, and his son . . .

A fresh shock went through Roger with the thought: Was Jamie here? In the house? And if he was, how old might he be? How old had he been when Brian Fraser dieâ€”

Fraser was shaking his head, his face troubled.

â€œI have not, sir. Whatâ€™s the name of the man whoâ€™s taken your lad?â€

â€œRobâ€”Robert Cameron, heâ€™s called. I dinna ken his people,â€ he added, falling naturally into Fraserâ€™s stronger accent.

â€œCameron . . .â€ Fraser murmured, tapping his fingers on the desk as he searched his memory. The motion flicked something in Rogerâ€™s memory; it was the ghost of one of Jamieâ€™s characteristic gestures when thinkingâ€”but Jamie, with his frozen finger, did it with the fingers flat, where his fatherâ€™s came down in a smooth ripple.

He picked up the glass again and took another sip, glancing as casually as he might at Fraserâ€™s face, searching for resemblance. It was there but subtle, mostly in the cock of the head, the set of the shouldersâ€”and the eyes. The face was quite different, square in the jaw, broader of brow, and Brian Fraserâ€™s eyes were a dark hazel, not blue, but the slanted shape of them, the wide mouthâ€”that was Jamie.

â€œThereâ€™re nay many Camerons nearer than Lochaber.â€ Fraser was shaking his head. â€œAnd Iâ€™ve heard nothing of a wanderer in the district.â€ He gave Roger a direct look, not accusing but definitely questioning. â€œWhy is it ye think the man came this way?â€

â€œIâ€”he was seen,â€ Roger blurted. â€œNear Craigh na Dun.â€

That startled Fraser.

â€œCraigh na Dun,â€ he repeated, leaning back a little, his eyes gone wary. â€œAh . . . and where might ye have come from yourself, sir?â€

â€œFrom Inverness,â€ Roger replied promptly. â€œI followed him from there.â€ Close enough. He was trying hard not to recall that heâ€™d left on his quest to find Cameron and Jem from the very spot in which he was now sitting. â€œIâ€”a friendâ€”a kinsmanâ€”came with me. I sent him toward Cranesmuir to search.â€

The news that he apparently wasnâ€™t a solitary nutter seemed to reassure Fraser, who pushed back from the desk and stood up, glancing at the window, where a big rose brier curved up gaunt and black against the fading sky.

â€œMmphm. Well, bide for a bit, sir, and ye will. Itâ€™s late in the day, and yeâ€™ll make no great distance before dark falls. Sup with us, and weâ€™ll gie ye a bed for the night. Mayhap your friend will catch ye up with good news, or one of my tenants may haâ€™ seen something. Iâ€™ll send round in the morning, to ask.â€

Rogerâ€™s legs were quivering with the urge to leap up, rush out, do something. But Fraser was right: it would be pointlessâ€”and dangerousâ€”to blunder round the Highland mountains in the dark, losing his way, perhaps be caught in a killing storm this time of year. He could hear the wind picking up; the rose brier beat at the glass of the window. It was going to rain soon. And is Jem out in it?

â€œIâ€”yes. I thank you, sir,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s most kind of ye.â€

Fraser patted him on the shoulder, went out into the hallway, and called, â€œJanet! Janet, weâ€™ve a guest for supper!â€

Janet?

Heâ€™d risen to his feet without thinking and came out of the office as the kitchen door swung openâ€”and a small, slender shape was momentarily silhouetted against the glow of the kitchen, rubbing her hands on her apron.

â€œMy daughter, Janet, sir,â€ Fraser said, drawing his daughter into the fading light. He smiled fondly at her. â€œThis is Mr. Roger MacKenzie, Jenny. Heâ€™s lost his wee lad somewhere.â€

â€œHe has?â€ The girl paused, halfway through a curtsy, and her eyes went wide. â€œWhatâ€™s happened, sir?â€

Roger explained again briefly about Rob Cameron and Craigh na Dun, but all the time was consumed by the desire to ask the young woman how old she was. Fifteen? Seventeen? Twenty-one? She was remarkably beautiful, with clear white skin that bloomed from the heat of cooking, soft curly black hair tied back from her face, and a trim figure that he tried hard not to stare atâ€”but what was most disturbing was that, despite her obvious femininity, she bore a startling resemblance to Jamie Fraser. She might be his daughter, he thought, and then brought himself up short, realizing afreshâ€”and remembering, with a stab of the heart that nearly dropped him to his kneesâ€”who Jamie Fraserâ€™s daughter really was.

Oh, God. Bree. Oh, Jesus, help me. Will I ever see her again?

He realized that heâ€™d fallen silent and was staring at Janet Fraser with his mouth open. Apparently she was used to this sort of response from men, though; she gave him a demure, slant-eyed smile, said that supper would be on the table in a few moments and maybe Da should show Mr. MacKenzie the way to the necessary? Then she was walking back down the hallway, the big door swung to behind her, and he found he could breathe again.



THE SUPPER WAS plain but plentiful and well cooked, and Roger found that food restored him amazingly. No wonderâ€”he couldnâ€™t remember when heâ€™d last eaten.

They ate in the kitchen, with a pair of housemaids called Annie and Senga and a man-of-all-work named Tom McTaggart sharing the table with the family. All of them were interested in Roger and, while giving him great sympathy in the matter of his missing son, were even more interested in where he might come from and what news he might bear.

Here he was at something of a loss, as he had no firm notion what year it was (Brian diedâ€”God, will dieâ€”when Jamie was nineteen, and if Jamie was born in May of 1721â€”or was it 1722?â€”and he was two years younger than Jenny . . .) and thus no idea what might have been happening in the world of late, but he delayed a bit, explaining his antecedents in some detailâ€”that was good manners, for one thing, and for another, his birthplace in Kyle of Lochalsh was far enough away from Lallybroch that the Frasers were unlikely to have met any of his people.

Then at last he had a bit of luck, when McTaggart told about taking off his shoe to shake out a stone, then seeing one of the pigs wriggle under the fence and head for the kailyard at a trot. He rushed after the pig, of course, and succeeded in catching itâ€”but had dragged it back to the pen only to find that the other pig had likewise wriggled out and was peacefully eating his shoe.

â€œThis was all she left!â€ he said, pulling half a shredded leather sole out of his pocket and waving it at them reproachfully. â€œAnd a rare struggle I had to pull it from her jaws!â€

â€œWhy did ye bother?â€ Jenny asked, wrinkling her nose at the dank object. â€œDinna trouble yourself, Taggie. Weâ€™ll slaughter the pigs next week, and ye can have a bit oâ€™ the hide to make yourself a new pair of shoon.â€



â€œAnd I suppose Iâ€™m to go barefoot â€™til then, am I?â€ McTaggart asked, disgruntled. â€œThereâ€™s frost on the ground in the morn, aye? I could take a chill and be dead of the pleurisy before yon pigâ€™s eaten its last bucket oâ€™ slops, let alone been tanned.â€

Brian laughed and lifted his chin toward Jenny. â€œDid your brother no leave a pair of his outgrown shoon behind when he left for Paris? I mind me he did, and if ye havena given them to the poor, might be as Taggie could manage wiâ€™ them for a bit.â€

Paris. Rogerâ€™s mind worked furiously, calculating. Jamie had spent not quite two years in Paris at the universitÃ© and had come back . . . when? When he was eighteen, he thought. Jamie would have beenâ€”will beâ€”eighteen in May of 1739. So it was now 1737, 1738, or 1739.

The narrowing of uncertainty calmed him a little, and he managed to put his mind to thinking of historical events that had occurred in that gap that he might offer as current news in conversation: absurdly, the first thing that came to mind was that the bottle opener had been invented in 1738. The second was that there had been an enormous earthquake in Bombay in 1737.

His audience was initially more interested by the bottle opener, which he was obliged to describe in detailâ€”inventing wildly, as he had no notion what the thing actually looked like, though there were sympathetic murmurs regarding the residents of Bombay and a brief prayer for the souls of those crushed under falling houses and the like.

â€œBut where is Bombay?â€ asked the younger of the housemaids, wrinkling her brow and looking from one face to another.

â€œIndia,â€ said Jenny promptly, and pushed back her chair. â€œSenga, fetch the cranachan, aye? Iâ€™ll show ye where India is.â€

She vanished through the swinging door, and the bustle of removing dishes left Roger with a few momentsâ€™ breathing space. He was beginning to feel a little easier, getting his bearings, though still agonized with worry for Jem. He did spare a momentâ€™s thought for William Buccleigh and how Buck might take the news of the date of their arrival.

Seventeen thirty-something . . . Jesus, Buck himself hadnâ€™t even been born yet! But, after all, what difference did that make? he asked himself. He hadnâ€™t been born yet, either, and had lived quite happily in a time prior to his birth before. . . . Could their proximity to the beginning of Buckâ€™s life have something to do with it, though?

He did knowâ€”or thought he knewâ€”that you couldnâ€™t go back to a time during your own lifetime. Trying to exist physically at the same time as yourself just wasnâ€™t on. It had just about killed him once; maybe theyâ€™d got too close to Buckâ€™s original lifeline, and Buck had somehow recoiled, taking Roger with him?

Before he could explore the implications of that unsettling thought, Jenny returned, carrying a large, thin book. This proved to be a hand-colored atlas, with mapsâ€”surprisingly accurate maps, in many casesâ€”and descriptions of â€œThe Nations of the World.â€

â€œMy brother sent it to me from Paris,â€ Jenny told him proudly, opening the book to a double-page spread of the Continent of India, where the starred circle indicating Bombay was surrounded by small drawings of palm trees, elephants, and something that upon close scrutiny turned out to be a tea plant. â€œHeâ€™s at the universitÃ© there.â€

â€œReally?â€ Roger smiled, being sure to look impressed. He was, the more so at realization of the effort and expense involved in going from this remote mountain wilderness to Paris. â€œHow long has he been there?â€

â€œOh, almost two years now,â€ Brian answered. He put out a hand and touched the page gently. â€œWe do miss the lad cruelly, but he writes often. And he sends us books.â€

â€œHeâ€™ll be back soon,â€ Jenny said, though with an air of conviction that seemed somewhat forced. â€œHe said heâ€™d come back.â€

Brian smiled, though this too was a little forced.

â€œAye. Iâ€™m sure I hope so, a nighean. But ye ken he may have found opportunities that keep him abroad for a time.â€

â€œOpportunities? Ye mean that de Marillac woman?â€ Jenny asked, a distinct edge in her voice. â€œI dinna like the way he writes about her. Not one bit.â€

â€œHe could do worse for a wife, lass.â€ Brian lifted one shoulder. â€œSheâ€™s from a good family.â€

Jenny made a very complicated sound in her throat, indicating sufficient respect for her father as to prevent her expressing a fuller opinion of â€œthat womanâ€ while still making that opinion plain. Her father laughed.

â€œYour brotherâ€™s no a complete fool,â€ he assured her. â€œI doubt heâ€™d marry a simpleton or aâ€”aâ€”â€ Heâ€™d obviously thought better of saying â€œwhoreâ€â€”his lips had begun to shape the wordâ€”but couldnâ€™t think of a substitute in time.

â€œHe would,â€ Jenny snapped. â€œHeâ€™d walk straight into a cobâ€™s web wiâ€™ his eyes wide open, if the cob had a pretty face and a round arse.â€

â€œJanet!â€ Her father tried to look shocked but failed utterly. McTaggart guffawed openly, and Annie and Senga giggled behind their hands. Jenny glowered at them but then drew herself up with dignity and addressed herself to their guest.

â€œSo, then, Mr. MacKenzie. Is your own wife living, I hope? And is she your weanâ€™s mother?â€

â€œIs sheâ€”â€ He felt the question like a blow in the chest but then remembered when he was. The odds of a woman surviving childbirth were no more than even in many places. â€œYes. Yes, sheâ€™sâ€”in Inverness, with our daughter.â€

Mandy. Oh, my sweet baby. Mandy. Bree. Jem. All at once, the enormity of it struck him. Heâ€™d managed so far to ignore it by concentrating on the need to find Jem, but now a cold wind whistled through the holes in his heart left by hurtling odds. The odds were that he would never see any of them again. And they would never know what had happened to him.

â€œOh, sir.â€ Jenny whispered it, leaning forward to lay a hand on his arm, her eyes wide with horror at what sheâ€™d provoked. â€œOh, sir, Iâ€™m sorry! I didna mean toâ€”â€

â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ he managed, forcing the words through his mangled larynx in a croak. â€œIâ€™mâ€”â€ He waved a hand in blind apology and stumbled out. He went straight out through the mudroom at the back of the house and found himself in the night outside.



There was a narrow crack of sullen light just at the tops of the mountains, where the cloud had not quite settled, but the yard about him was deep in shadow, and the wind touched his face with the scent of cold rain. He was shaking, but not from chill, and sat down abruptly on the big stone by the path where they pulled the childrenâ€™s wellies off when it was muddy.

He put his elbows on his knees and his face in his hands, overcome for a moment. Not only for his own situationâ€”but for those in the house. Jamie Fraser was coming home soon. And soon after there would come the afternoon when red-coated soldiers marched into the yard at Lallybroch, finding Janet and the servants alone. And the events would be set in train that would end with the death of Brian Fraser, struck down by an apoplexy while watching his only son floggedâ€”he thoughtâ€”to death.

Jamie . . . Roger shivered, seeing in mind not his indomitable father-in-law but the lighthearted young man who, among the distractions of Paris, still thought to send books to his sister. Whoâ€”

It had begun to rain, with a quiet thoroughness that slicked his face in seconds. At least no one would know if he wept in despair. I canâ€™t stop it, he thought. I canâ€™t tell them whatâ€™s coming.

A huge shape loomed out of the darkness, startling him, and the dog leaned heavily against him, nearly pushing him off the stone he sat on. A large, hairy nose was thrust sympathetically into his ear, whoofling and wetter than the rain.

â€œJesus, dog,â€ he said, half-laughing in spite of everything. â€œGod.â€ He put his arms round the big, smelly creature and rested his forehead against its massive neck, feeling inchoate comfort.

He thought of nothing for a little and was inexpressibly relieved. Little by little, though, coherent thought came back. It maybe wasnâ€™t true that thingsâ€”the pastâ€”couldnâ€™t be changed. Not the big things, maybe, not kings and battles. But maybeâ€”just maybeâ€”the small ones could. If he couldnâ€™t come right out and tell the Frasers of Lallybroch what doom was to come upon them, perhaps there was something he could say, some warning that might forestallâ€”

And if he did? If they listened? Would that good man in the house die of his apoplexy anyway, some weakness in his brain giving way as he came in from the barn one day? But that would leave his son and his daughter safeâ€”and then what?

Would Jamie stay in Paris and marry the flirtatious Frenchwoman? Would he come home peaceably to live at Lallybroch and mind his estate and his sister?

Either way, he wouldnâ€™t be riding near Craigh na Dun in five or six years, pursued by English soldiers, wounded and needing the assistance of a random time traveler who had just stepped out of the stones. And if he didnâ€™t meet Claire Randall. . . . Bree, he thought. Oh, Christ. Bree.

There was a sound behind himâ€”the door of the house openingâ€”and the beam of a lantern fell onto the path nearby.

â€œMr. MacKenzie?â€ Brian Fraser called into the night. â€œAre ye all right, man?â€

â€œGod,â€ he whispered, clutching the dog. â€œShow me what to do.â€





LIGHTS, ACTION, SIRENS

THE DOOR AT THE top of the staircase was locked. Jem pounded on it with his fists, kicked it with his feet, and shouted. He could feel it back down there behind him, in the dark, and the feel of it crawled up his back, as if it were coming to get him, and the thought of that scared him so bad that he shrieked like a ban-sÃ¬dhe and threw himself hard against the door, over and over, andâ€”

The door flew open and he fell flat on a dirty lino floor, all footmarks and cigarette butts.

â€œWhat the devilâ€”who are you, laddie, and what in Godâ€™s name were ye doing in there?â€

A big hand grabbed him by the arm and pulled him up. He was out of breath from yelling and almost blubbering from relief, and it took a minute to remember who he was.

â€œJem.â€ He swallowed, blinking in the light, and wiped his face on his sleeve. â€œJem MacKenzie. My mamâ€™s . . .â€ He went blank, suddenly unable to remember what Mamâ€™s first name was. â€œShe works here sometimes.â€

â€œI know your mam. No mistaking that hair, laddie.â€ The man whoâ€™d pulled him up was a security guard; the patch on his shirtsleeve said so. He tilted his head to one side and the other, looking Jem over, light flashing off his bald head, off his glasses. The light was coming from those long tube lights in the ceiling Da said were fluorescent; they buzzed and reminded him of the thing in the tunnel, and he turned round fast and shoved the door shut with a bang.

â€œIs someone chasinâ€™ ye, lad?â€ The guard reached a hand toward the doorknob, and Jem put his back hard against the door.

â€œNo!â€ He could feel it back there, behind the door. Waiting. The guard was frowning at him. â€œIâ€”I justâ€”itâ€™s really dark down there.â€

â€œYe were down in the dark? However did ye come to be there? And whereâ€™s your mother?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ Jem started being scared again. Really scared. Because Mr. Cameron had shut him up in the tunnel so he could go somewhere. And he might have gone to Lallybroch.

â€œMr. Cameron put me in there,â€ he blurted. â€œHe was supposed to take me to spend the night with Bobby, but instead he took me to Craigh na Dun, and then he took me to his house and locked me in a room overnight, and then the next morning he brought me here and shut me up in the tunnel.â€

â€œCameronâ€”what, Rob Cameron?â€ The guard crouched down so he could frown right into Jemâ€™s face. â€œWhy?â€



â€œIâ€”I donâ€™t know.â€ Donâ€™t ever tell anyone, Da had said. Jem swallowed hard. Even if he wanted to tell, he didnâ€™t know how to start. He could say Mr. Cameron took him up the hill at Craigh na Dun, to the stones, and pushed him into one. But he couldnâ€™t tell what had happened then, not any more than he could tell Mr. MacLeodâ€”thatâ€™s what it said on his badge, JOCK MACLEODâ€”what the shiny thing in the tunnel was.

Mr. MacLeod made a thinking noise in his throat, shook his head, and stood up.

â€œWell, Iâ€™d best be calling your parents to come and fetch ye home, aye? They can say if they maybe want to speak to the polis.â€

â€œPlease,â€ Jem whispered, feeling his knees turn to water at the thought of Mam and Da coming to get him. â€œYes, please.â€

Mr. MacLeod took him along to a little office where the phone was, gave him a warm can of Coke, and told him to sit down just there and say his parentsâ€™ telephone number. He sipped the drink and felt lots better right away, watching Mr. MacLeodâ€™s thick finger whirl the telephone dial. A pause, and then he could hear ringing on the other end. Breep-breep . . . breep-breep . . . breep-breep . . .

It was warm in the office, but he was starting to feel cold around his face and hands. Nobody was answering the phone.

â€œMaybe theyâ€™re asleep,â€ he said, stifling a Coke burp. Mr. MacLeod gave him a sideways look and shook his head, pushed down the receiver, and dialed the number again, making Jem say the numbers one at a time.

Breep-breep. . . . breep-breep . . .

He was concentrating so hard on willing somebody to pick up the phone that he didnâ€™t notice anything until Mr. MacLeod suddenly turned his head toward the door, looking surprised.

â€œWhatâ€”â€ the guard said, and then there was a blur and a thunking noise like when cousin Ian shot a deer with an arrow, and Mr. MacLeod made an awful noise and fell right out of his chair onto the floor, and the chair shot away and fell over with a crash.

Jem didnâ€™t remember standing up, but he was pressed against the filing cabinet, squeezing the can so hard that the bubbly Coke blurped out and foamed over his fingers.

â€œYou come with me, boy,â€ said the man whoâ€™d hit Mr. MacLeod. He was holding what Jem thought must be a cosh, though heâ€™d never seen one. He couldnâ€™t move, even if heâ€™d wanted to.

The man made an impatient noise, stepped over Mr. MacLeod like he was a bag of rubbish, and grabbed Jem by the hand. Out of sheer terror, Jem bit him, hard. The man yelped and let go, and Jem threw the can of Coke right at his face, and when the man ducked, he tore past him and out of the office and down the long hallway, running for his life.



IT WAS GETTING late; they passed fewer and fewer cars on the road, and Mandyâ€™s head began to nod. The mouse-princess mask had ridden up on top of her head, its pipe-cleaner whiskers poking up like antennae. Seeing this in the rearview mirror, Brianna had a sudden vision of Mandy as a tiny radar station, scanning the bleak countryside for Jemâ€™s small, pulsing signal.

Could she? She shook her head, not to dispel the notion but to keep her mind from slipping all the way out of reality. The adrenaline of her earlier rage and terror had all drained away; her hands shook a little on the steering wheel, and the darkness around them seemed vast, a yawning void that would swallow them in an instant if she stopped driving, if the feeble beam of the headlights ceased . . .

â€œWarm,â€ Mandy murmured sleepily.

â€œWhat, baby?â€ Sheâ€™d heard but was too hypnotized by the effort of keeping her eyes on the road to take it in consciously.

â€œWarm . . . er.â€ Mandy struggled upright, cross. The yarn ties of her mask were stuck in her hair, and she made a high-pitched cranky noise as she yanked at them.

Brianna pulled carefully onto the verge, set the hand brake, and, reaching back, began to disentangle the mask.

â€œYou mean weâ€™re going toward Jem?â€ she asked, careful to keep her voice from trembling.

â€œUh-huh.â€ Free of the nuisance, Mandy yawned hugely and flung out a hand toward the window. â€œMmp.â€ She put her head down on her arms and whined sleepily.

Bree swallowed, closed her eyes, then opened them, looking carefully in the direction Mandy had pointed. There was no road . . . but there was, and with a trickle of ice water down her spine, she saw the small brown sign that said: SERVICE ROAD. NO PUBLIC ACCESS. NORTH OF SCOTLAND HYDRO ELECTRIC BOARD. Loch Errochty dam. The tunnel.

â€œDamn!â€ said Brianna, and stomped the gas, forgetting the hand brake. The car jumped and stalled, and Mandy sat bolt upright, eyes glazed and wide as a sun-stunned owlâ€™s.

â€œIss we home yet?â€



JEM PELTED DOWN the hallway and threw himself at the swinging door at the end, so hard that he skidded all the way across the landing on the other side and fell down the stairs beyond, bumping and banging and ending up in a dazed heap at the bottom.

He heard the footsteps coming fast toward the door above and, with a small, terrified squeak, scrambled on all fours round the second landing and launched himself headfirst down the next flight, tobogganing on his stomach for a few stairs, then tipping arse over teakettle and somersaulting down the rest.

He was crying with terror, gulping air and trying not to make a noise, stumbling to his feet, and everything hurt, everythingâ€”but the door: he had to get outside. He staggered through the half-dark lobby, the only lights shining through the glass window where the receptionist usually sat. The man was coming; he could hear him cursing at the bottom of the stairs.



The main door had a chain looped through the bars. Swiping tears on his sleeve, he ran back in to the reception, looking wildly round. EMERGENCY EXITâ€”there it was, the red sign over the door at the far end of another small corridor. The man burst into the lobby and saw him.

â€œCome back here, you little bugger!â€

He looked round wildly, grabbed the first thing he saw, which was a rolling chair, and pushed it as hard as he could into the lobby. The man cursed and jumped aside, and Jem ran for the door and flung himself against it, bursting into the night with a scream of sirens and the flash of blinding lights.



â€œWHASSAT, MUMMY? Mummy, I scared, I SCARED!â€

â€œAnd you think Iâ€™m not?â€ Bree said under her breath, heart in her mouth. â€œItâ€™s okay, baby,â€ she said aloud, and pressed her foot to the floor. â€œWeâ€™re just going to get Jem.â€

The car slewed to a stop on the gravel, and she leapt out but dithered for a moment, needing urgently to rush toward the building, where sirens and lights were going off over an open door at the side, but unable to leave Mandy alone in the car. She could hear the rush of water down the spillway.

â€œCome with me, sweetheart,â€ she said, hastily undoing the seat belt. â€œThatâ€™s right, here, let me carry you . . .â€ Even as she spoke, she was looking here, there, from the lights into the darkness, every nerve she had screaming that her son was here, he was here, he had to be . . . rushing water . . . her mind filled with horror, thinking of Jem falling into the spillway, or Jem in the service tunnelâ€”God, why hadnâ€™t she gone there first? Of course Rob Cameron would have put him there, he had the keys, he . . . but the lights, the sirens . . .

Sheâ€™d almost made itâ€”at a dead run, impeded only slightly by thirty pounds of toddlerâ€”when she saw a big man at the edge of the drive, thrashing through the bushes with a stick or something, cursing a blue streak.

â€œWhat do you think youâ€™re doing?â€ she bellowed. Mandy, alarmed anew, let out a screech like a scalded baboon, and the man jumped, whirling to face them, stick raised.

â€œWhat the bleedinâ€™ hell are you doing here?â€ he said, so taken aback that he spoke almost normally. â€œYouâ€™re supposed to beâ€”â€

Bree had peeled Mandy off. Setting her daughter down behind her, she prepared to take the man apart with her bare hands, if necessary. Evidently this intent showed, because the man dropped the stick and abruptly vanished into the darkness.

Then flashing lights washed over the drive and she realized that it wasnâ€™t her own aspect that had frightened him. Mandy was clinging to her leg, too frightened even to wail anymore. Bree picked her up, patting her gently, and turned to face the two police officers who were advancing cautiously toward her, hands on their batons. She felt wobbly-legged and dreamlike, things fading in and out of focus with the strobing lights. The rush of tons of falling water filled her ears.

â€œMandy,â€ she said into her daughterâ€™s warm curly hair, her own voice almost drowned out by the sirens. â€œCan you feel Jem? Please tell me you can feel him.â€

â€œHere I am, Mummy,â€ said a small voice behind her. Convinced she was hallucinating, she lifted a restraining hand toward the police officers and pivoted slowly round. Jem was standing on the drive six feet away, dripping wet, plastered with dead leaves, and swaying like a drunk.

Then she was sitting splay-legged on the gravel, a child clutched in each arm, trying hard not to shake, so they wouldnâ€™t notice. She didnâ€™t start to sob, though, until Jemmy lifted a tearstained face from her shoulder and said, â€œWhereâ€™s Daddy?â€





THE SHINE OF A ROCKING HORSEâ€™S EYES

FRASER DIDNâ€™T ASK BUT poured them each a dram of whisky, warm-smelling and smoke-tinged. There was something comfortable in drinking whisky in company, no matter how bad the whisky. Or the company, for that matter. This particular bottle was something special, and Roger was grateful, both to the bottle and its giver, for the sense of comfort that rose from the glass, beckoning him, a genie from the bottle.

â€œSlÃ inte,â€ he said, lifting the glass, and saw Fraser glance at him in sudden interest. Lord, what had he said? â€œSlÃ inteâ€ was one of the words that had a distinct pronunciation, depending on where you came fromâ€”men from Harris and Lewis said â€œSlÃ n-ya,â€ while far north it was more like â€œSlÃ nj.â€ Heâ€™d used the form heâ€™d grown up with in Inverness; was it strikingly wrong for where heâ€™d said he came from? He didnâ€™t want Fraser to think him a liar.

â€œWhat is it ye do for yourself, a chompanaich?â€ Fraser asked, having taken a sip, closing his eyes in momentary respect to the drink, then opening them to regard Roger with a kind curiosityâ€”tinged perhaps with a little wariness, lest his visitor be unhinged. â€œIâ€™m accustomed to know a manâ€™s work at once by his dress and mannerâ€”not that ye find many folk truly unusual up here.â€ He smiled a bit at that. â€œAnd drovers, tinkers, and gypsies dinna take much effort to descry. Clearly youâ€™re none of those.â€



â€œI have a bit of land,â€ Roger replied. It was an expected question; he was ready with an answerâ€”but found himself longing to say more. To tell the truthâ€”so far as he himself understood it.

â€œIâ€™ve left my wife wiâ€™ the running of things whilst I came to search for our lad. Beyond thatâ€”â€ He lifted one shoulder briefly. â€œI was trained as a minister.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ Fraser leaned back, surveying him with interest. â€œI could see yeâ€™re an educated man. I was thinkinâ€™ maybe a schoolmaster or a clerkâ€”perhaps a lawyer.â€

â€œIâ€™ve been both schoolmaster and clerk,â€ Roger said, smiling. â€œHavena quite risenâ€”or fallen, maybeâ€”to the practice of law yet.â€

â€œAnd a good thing, too.â€ Fraser sipped, half-smiling.

Roger shrugged. â€œLawâ€™s a corrupt power but one acceptable to men by reason of having arisen from menâ€”itâ€™s a way of getting on wiâ€™ things, is the best ye can say for it.â€

â€œAnd not a mean thing to say for it, either,â€ Fraser agreed. â€œThe lawâ€™s a necessary evilâ€”we canna be doing without itâ€”but do ye not think it a poor substitute for conscience? Speakinâ€™ as a minister, I mean?â€

â€œWell . . . aye. I do,â€ Roger said, somewhat surprised. â€œIt would be best for men to deal decently with one another in accordance withâ€”well, with Godâ€™s principles, if yeâ€™ll pardon my putting it that way. But what are ye to do, first, if ye have men to whom God is of no account, and, second, if ye have menâ€”and you do, alwaysâ€”who own no power greater than their own?â€

Fraser nodded, interested.

â€œAye, well, itâ€™s true that the best conscience willna avail a man who willna mind it. But what dâ€™ye do when conscience speaks differently to men of goodwill?â€

â€œAs in political disputes, you mean? Supporters of the Stuarts versus those of the . . . the House of Hanover?â€ It was a reckless thing to say, but it might help him to figure out when he was, and he meant to say nothing that might make it look as though he had a personal stake on either side.

Fraserâ€™s face underwent a surprising flow of expression, from being taken aback to mild distate, this then ending in a look of half-amused ruefulness.

â€œLike that,â€ he agreed. â€œI fought for the House of Stuart in my youth, and while Iâ€™d not say that conscience didna come into it, it didna come very far onto the field wiâ€™ me.â€ His mouth quirked at the corner, and Roger felt again the tiny plop! of a stone tossed into his depths, the ripples of recognition spreading through him. Jamie did that. Brianna didnâ€™t. Jem did.

He couldnâ€™t stop to think about it, though; the conversation was teetering delicately on the precipice of an invitation to political disclosure, and that, he couldnâ€™t do.

â€œWas it Sheriffmuir?â€ he asked, making no effort to disguise his interest.

â€œIt was,â€ Fraser said, openly surprised. He eyed Roger dubiously. â€œYe canna have gone yourself, surely . . . did your faither maybe tell ye?â€

â€œNo,â€ said Roger, with the momentary twinge that thought of his father always brought. In fact, Fraser was only a few years older than himself, but he knew the other man doubtless took him for a decade younger than he was.



â€œI . . . heard a song about it. â€™Twas two shepherds met on a hillside, talking about the great fightâ€”and arguing whoâ€™d won it.â€

That made Fraser laugh.

â€œWell they might! We were arguing that before we finished pickinâ€™ up the wounded.â€ He took a sip of whisky and washed it meditatively round his mouth, clearly reminiscing. â€œSo, then, how does the song go?â€

Roger breathed deep, ready to sing, and then remembered. Fraser had seen his rope scar and been tactful enough not to remark on it, but no need to make the damage obvious. Instead, he chanted the first few lines, tapping his fingers on the desk, echoing the rhythm of the big bodhran that was the songâ€™s only accompaniment.

â€œO cam ye here the fight to shun,



Or herd the sheep wiâ€™ me, man?



Or were ye at the Sherra-moor,



Or did the battle see, man?â€



I saw the battle, sair and teugh,



And reekin-red ran mony a sheugh;



My heart, for fear, gaed sough for sough,



To hear the thuds, and see the cluds



Oâ€™ clans frae woods, in tartan duds,



Wha glaumâ€™d at kingdoms three, man.



It went better than heâ€™d thought; the song really was more chanted than sung, and he managed the whole of it with no more than the odd choke or cough. Fraser was rapt, glass forgotten in his hand.

â€œOh, thatâ€™s braw, man!â€ Fraser exclaimed. â€œThough yon poetâ€™s got the devil of an accent. Whereâ€™s he come from, dâ€™ye ken?â€

â€œEr . . . Ayrshire, I think.â€

Fraser shook his head in admiration and sat back.

â€œCould ye maybe write it down for me?â€ he asked, almost shyly. â€œI wouldna put ye to the trouble of singinâ€™ it again, but Iâ€™d dearly love to learn the whole of it.â€

â€œIâ€”sure,â€ Roger said, taken aback. Well, what harm could it do to let Robert Burnsâ€™s poem loose in the world some years in advance of Burns himself? â€œKen anyone who can play a bodhran? Itâ€™s best wiâ€™ the drum rattlinâ€™ in the background.â€ He tapped his fingers in illustration.

â€œOh, aye.â€ Fraser was rustling about in the drawer of his desk; he came out with several sheets of foolscap, most with writing on them. Frowning, he flicked through the papers, picked one, and pulled it from the sheaf, placing it facedown in front of Roger, offering him the blank back side.

There were goose quills, rather tattered from use but well trimmed, in a jar on the desk, and a brass inkstand, which Fraser offered him with a generous sweep of one broad hand.

â€œMy sonâ€™s friend plays wellâ€”heâ€™s gone for a soldier, though, moreâ€™s the pity.â€ A shadow crossed Fraserâ€™s face.

â€œAch.â€ Roger clicked his tongue in sympathy; he was trying to make out the writing that showed faintly through the sheet. â€œJoined a Highland regiment, did he?â€

â€œNo,â€ Fraser said, sounding a little startled. Christ, were there Highland regiments yet? â€œHeâ€™s gone to France as a mercenary soldier. Better pay, fewer floggings than the army, he tells his da.â€

Rogerâ€™s heart lifted; yes! It was a letter or maybe a journal entryâ€”whatever it was, there was a date on it: 17 . . . was that a 3? Had to be, couldnâ€™t be an 8. 173 . . . it might be a 9 or a 0, couldnâ€™t tell for sure through the paperâ€”no, it had to be a 9, so 1739. He breathed a sigh of relief. Something October, 1739.

â€œProbably safer,â€ he said, only half attending to the conversation as he began to scratch out the lines. It was some time since heâ€™d written with a quill, and he was awkward.

â€œSafer?â€

â€œAye,â€ he said, â€œfrom the point of view of disease, mostly. Most men that die in the army die of some sickness, ken. Comes from the crowding, having to live in barracks, eat army rations. Iâ€™d think mercenaries might have a bit more freedom.â€

Fraser muttered something about â€œfreedom to starve,â€ but it was half under his breath. He was tapping his own fingers on the desk, trying to catch the rhythm as Roger wrote. He was surprisingly rather good; by the time the song was finished, he was singing it softly in a pleasant low tenor and had the drumming down pretty well.

Rogerâ€™s mind was divided between the task in front of him and the feel of the letter under his hand. The feel of the paper and the look of the ink reminded him vividly of the wooden box, filled with Jamieâ€™s and Claireâ€™s letters. He had to stop himself from glancing at the shelf where it would be kept when this room was his.

Theyâ€™d been rationing the letters, reading them slowlyâ€”but when Jem was taken, all bets were off. Theyâ€™d rushed through the whole of the box, looking for any mention of Jem, any indication that he might have escaped from Cameron and found his way to the safety of his grandparents. Not a word about Jem. Not one.

Theyâ€™d been so distraught that theyâ€™d scarcely noticed anything else the letters said, but occasional phrases and images floated up in his mind, quite randomlyâ€”some of them distinctly disturbingâ€”Briannaâ€™s uncle Ian had diedâ€”but scarcely noticeable at the time.

They werenâ€™t anything he wanted to think about now, either.

â€œWill your son be studying the law, then, in Paris?â€ Roger asked abruptly. He picked up the fresh dram Brian had poured for him and took a sip.

â€œAye, well, heâ€™d maybe make a decent lawyer,â€ Fraser admitted. â€œHe could argue ye into the ground, Iâ€™ll say that for him. But I think he hasna got the patience for law or politics.â€ He smiled suddenly. â€œJamie sees at once what he thinks should be done and canna understand why anyone else should think otherwise. And heâ€™d rather pound someone than persuade them, if it comes to that.â€

Roger laughed ruefully.



â€œI understand the urge,â€ he said.

â€œOh, indeed.â€ Fraser nodded, leaning back a little in his chair. â€œAnd Iâ€™ll no say as thatâ€™s not a necessary thing to do on occasion. Especially in the Highlands.â€ He grimaced but not without humor.

â€œSo, then. Why do ye think this Cameron has stolen your lad?â€ Fraser asked bluntly.

Roger wasnâ€™t surprised. As well as theyâ€™d been getting on together, heâ€™d known Fraser had to be wondering just how much Roger was telling and how truthful he was. Well, heâ€™d been ready for that questionâ€”and the answer was at least a version of the truth.

â€œWe lived for a time in America,â€ he said, and felt a pang with the saying of it. For an instant, their snug cabin on the Ridge was around him, Brianna asleep with her hair loose on the pillow beside him and the childrenâ€™s breath a sweet fog above them.

â€œAmerica!â€ Fraser exclaimed in astonishment. â€œWhere, then?â€

â€œThe colony of North Carolina. A good place,â€ Roger hastened to add, â€œbut not without its dangers.â€

â€œName me one that is,â€ Fraser said, but waved that aside. â€œAnd these dangers made ye come back?â€

Roger shook his head, a tightness in his throat at the memory.

â€œNo, it was our wee lassâ€”Mandy, Amanda, sheâ€™s called. She was born with a thing wrong with her heart, and there was no physician there who could treat it. So we came . . . back, and while we were in Scotland, my wife inherited some land, and so we stayed. But . . .â€ He hesitated, thinking how to put the rest, but knowing what he did of Fraserâ€™s antecedents and his history with the MacKenzies of Leoch, the man probably wouldnâ€™t be overly disturbed at his story.

â€œMy wifeâ€™s father,â€ he said carefully, â€œis a good manâ€”a very good manâ€”but the sort who . . . draws attention. A leader of men, and one that other men . . . Well, he told me once that his own father had said to him that, since he was a large man, other men would try himâ€”and they do.â€

He watched Brian Fraserâ€™s face carefully at this, but, beyond the twitch of an eyebrow, there was no apparent response.

â€œIâ€™ll not go into all the history of itâ€â€”since it hasnâ€™t happened yetâ€”â€œbut the long and the short of it is that my father-in-law was left in possession of a large sum in gold. He doesna regard it as his own property but as something held in trust. Still, there it is. And while itâ€™s been kept secret so far as possible . . .â€

Fraser made a sympathetic sound, acknowledging the difficulties of secrecy in such conditions.

â€œSo this Cameron learned of the treasure, did he? And thought to extort it from your father-in-law by taking the bairn captive?â€ Fraserâ€™s dark brow lowered at the thought.

â€œThat may be in his mind. But beyond thatâ€”my son kens where the gold is hidden. He was with his grandfather when it was put away safe. Only the two of them ken the whereaboutsâ€”but Cameron learned that my son knew the place.â€

â€œAh.â€ Brian sat for a moment staring into his whisky, thinking. Finally he cleared his throat and looked up, meeting Rogerâ€™s eyes. â€œI maybe shouldna say such a thing, but it may be in your own mind already. If heâ€™s taken the boy only because the lad kens where yon treasure is . . . well, was I a wicked man with no scruples, I think I might force the information out of the lad, so soon as I had him alone.â€

Roger felt the cold slide of the suggestion down into the pit of his belly. It was something that had been at the back of his own mind, though he hadnâ€™t admitted it to himself.

â€œMake him tellâ€”and then kill him, you mean.â€

Fraser grimaced unhappily.

â€œI dinna want to think it,â€ he said. â€œBut without the lad, what is there to mark him out? A man aloneâ€”he could travel as he liked, without much notice.â€

â€œYes,â€ Roger said, and stopped to breathe. â€œYes. Well . . . he didnâ€™t. Iâ€”I know the man, a little. I donâ€™t think heâ€™d do that, murâ€”â€ His throat closed suddenly, and he coughed violently. â€œMurder a child,â€ he finished hoarsely. â€œHe wouldnâ€™t.â€



THEY GAVE HIM a room at the end of the hallway on the second floor. When his family would live here, this would be the childrenâ€™s playroom. He undressed to his shirt, put out the candle, and got into bed, resolutely ignoring the shadows in the corners that held the ghosts of giant cardboard building blocks, of dollhouses, six-guns, and chalkboards. The fringed skirt of Mandyâ€™s Annie Oakley costume fluttered at the corner of his eye.

He ached from follicles to toenails, inside and out, but the panic engendered by his arrival had passed. How he felt didnâ€™t matter, though; the question wasâ€”what now? They hadnâ€™t gone where they thought, he and Buck, but he had to assume that they had ended up in the right place. The place where Jem was.

How else could they have come here? Perhaps Rob Cameron knew more now about how the traveling worked, could control it, and had deliberately brought Jem to this time, in order to frustrate pursuit?

He was too exhausted to keep hold of his thoughts, let alone string them into coherence. He pushed everything out of his mind, so far as he could, and lay still, staring into the dark, seeing the shine of a rocking horseâ€™s eyes.

Then he got out of bed, knelt on the cold boards, and prayed.





â€œFOR MANY MEN WHO STUMBLE AT THE THRESHOLD ARE WELL FORETOLD THAT DANGER LURKS WITHINâ€

Lallybroch

October 31, 1980

BRIANNA COULDNâ€™T open her own front door. She kept trying, rattling the big iron key all over the escutcheon plate, until the WPC took it from her shaking hand and got it into the keyhole. She hadnâ€™t started to shake until the police car turned up the lane to Lallybroch.

â€œRather an old lock,â€ the police constable observed, giving it a dubious look. â€œOriginal to the house, is it?â€ She lifted her head, peering up the white-harled front of the house, pursing her lips at sight of the lintel, with its carved date.

â€œI donâ€™t know. We donâ€™t usually lock the door. Weâ€™ve never had burglars.â€ Briannaâ€™s lips felt numb, but she thought sheâ€™d managed a weak smile. Luckily, Mandy was unable to contradict this bald-faced lie, as sheâ€™d seen a toad in the grass by the path and was following it, poking at it with the toe of her shoe to make it hop. Jemmy, glued protectively to Briannaâ€™s side, made a low noise in his throat that reminded her startlingly of her father, and she looked down at him, narrowing her eyes.

He made the noise again and looked away.

There was a rattle and click as the lock opened, and the constable straightened up with a pleased sound.

â€œAye, thatâ€™s done it. Now, youâ€™re quite sure as youâ€™ll be all right, will you, Mrs. MacKenzie?â€ the woman said, giving her a dubious look. â€œOut here by yourself, and your man away?â€

â€œHeâ€™ll be home soon,â€ Brianna assured her, though her stomach went hollow at the words.

The woman eyed her consideringly, then gave a reluctant nod and pushed open the door.

â€œWell, then, you know best, I expect. Iâ€™ll just check to see that your phoneâ€™s in order and all the doors and windows locked, shall I, while you have a look round to be sure everythingâ€™s as it should be?â€

The lump of ice that had formed in her middle during the long hours of questioning shot straight up into her chest.



â€œIâ€”Iâ€”Iâ€™m sure everythingâ€™s fine.â€ But the constable had already gone inside and was waiting impatiently for her. â€œJem! Bring Mandy inside and take her up to the playroom, will you?â€ She couldnâ€™t bear to leave the kids outside by themselves, exposed. She could scarcely bear to have them out of her sight. But the very last thing she needed was to have Mandy tagging helpfully along, chatting to Constable Laughlin about Mr. Rob in the priestâ€™s hole. Leaving the door open, she hurried after the WPC.

â€œThe phoneâ€™s in there,â€ she said, catching up with Constable Laughlin in the hall and gesturing toward Rogerâ€™s study. â€œThereâ€™s an extension in the kitchen. Iâ€™ll go and check that and see to the back door.â€ Not waiting for an answer, she strode down the hall and nearly threw herself through the swinging door that led to the kitchen.

She didnâ€™t pause to check anything but jerked open the junk drawer and snatched up a big rubber-covered flashlight. Meant to assist farmers lambing at night or searching for lost stock, the thing was a foot long and weighed nearly two pounds.

The .22 rifle was in the mudroom, and for an instant, as she walked through the house, she debated killing him, in a dispassionate way that would probably scare her if she had time to think about it. She had Jem back, after allâ€”but no. Constable Laughlin would certainly recognize the sound of a shot, in spite of the muffling green baize on the kitchen door. And there was apparently more she needed to learn from Rob Cameron. Sheâ€™d knock him unconscious and tape his mouth.

She stepped into the mudroom and quietly closed the kitchen door behind her. There was a deadbolt, but she couldnâ€™t lock it from this side without the key, and her keys were on the table in the foyer, where Constable Laughlin had left them. Instead, she dragged the heavy bench over and jammed it catty-corner between the door and the wall, concentrating on the logistics. Where was the best place to hit someone on the head so as to render them unconscious without fracturing their skull? She had a vague memory of her mother mentioning that once . . . the occiput?

Sheâ€™d expected an outcry from Cameron at the sound of her entry, but he didnâ€™t peep. She could hear footsteps above, the confident stride of an adult going down the hall. Constable Laughlin on her tour of inspection, no doubt checking the first-floor windows, ladder-bearing burglars in mind. She closed her eyes for an instant, envisioning the constable sticking her head into the playroom just as Mandy was regaling her brother with the details of her own adventures the night before.

Nothing to be done about that. She took a deep breath, lifted the grate over the priestâ€™s hole, and shone the light down into the shadows. The empty shadows.

For a few moments she went on looking, swinging the torch beam from one side of the priestâ€™s hole to the other, then back, then back again . . . her mind simply refusing to believe her eyes.

The light caught the dull gleam of duct tapeâ€”two or three discarded wads, flung into a corner. There was a cold feeling at the back of her neck, and she jerked round, flashlight raisedâ€”but it was no more than apprehension; no one was there. The outer door was locked, the mudroom windows secure.



The door was locked. She made a small, frightened sound and clapped her hand hard over her mouth. Like the door between mudroom and kitchen, the mudroomâ€™s outer door locked with a deadboltâ€”from the inside. If someone had gone out that way and left the door locked behind himâ€”he had a key to the house. And her rifle was gone.



THEYâ€™RE TOO LITTLE, she kept thinking. They shouldnâ€™t know about things like this; they shouldnâ€™t know itâ€™s possible. Her hands were shaking; it took three tries to open the sticky drawer in Mandyâ€™s dresser, and after the third failure, she pounded it in fury with the side of her fist, whispering through gritted teeth, â€œYou goddamned fucking bloody buggering thing! Donâ€™t you dare get in my way!â€ She crashed her fist on top of the dresser, raised her foot, and smashed the sole of her sneaker into the thing so hard that it rocked back and thumped into the wall with a bang.

She grabbed the drawer pulls and yanked. The terrorized drawer shot out, and she snatched the whole thing free and flung it into the opposite wall, where it struck and exploded in a rainbow spray of underpants and tiny striped T-shirts.

She walked over and looked down at the battered drawer, lying upside down on the floor.

â€œSo there,â€ she said calmly. â€œTeach you to get in my way when I have things to think about.â€

â€œLike what, Mam?â€ said a cautious voice from the doorway. She looked up to see Jemmy hovering there, eyes flicking from her to the mistreated drawer and back.

â€œOh.â€ She thought of trying to explain the drawer but instead cleared her throat and sat down on the bed, holding out a hand to him. â€œCome here, a bhalaich.â€

His ginger brows flicked up at the Gaelic endearment, but he came willingly, cuddling into her arm. He hugged her hard, burying his head in her shoulder, and she held him as tightly as she could, rocking back and forth and making the sorts of soft noises sheâ€™d made to him when he was tiny.

â€œItâ€™ll be all right, baby,â€ she whispered to him. â€œIt will.â€

She heard him swallow and felt his small, square back move under her hand.

â€œYeah.â€ His voice quivered a little and he sniffed hard, then tried again. â€œYeah. But whatâ€™s going to be all right, Mam? Whatâ€™s going on?â€ He drew away a little then, looking up at her with eyes that held more questions and more knowledge than any nine-year-old should reasonably have.

â€œMandy says you put Mr. Cameron in the priestâ€™s hole. But heâ€™s not there nowâ€”I looked.â€

A cold hand stroked her nape as she remembered the shock of the empty hole.

â€œNo, heâ€™s not.â€

â€œBut you didnâ€™t let him out, did you?â€

â€œNo. I didnâ€™t let him out. Heâ€”â€

â€œSo somebody else did,â€ he said positively. â€œWho, do you think?â€

â€œYou have a very logical mind,â€ she said, smiling a little, despite herself. â€œYou get it from your Grandda Jamie.â€

â€œHe said I got it from Grannie Claire,â€ Jem replied, but automatically; he wasnâ€™t to be distracted. â€œI thought maybe it was the man who chased me at the damâ€”but he couldnâ€™t have been here letting Mr. Cameron out at the same time he was chasing me. Could he?â€ A sudden fear showed in his eyes, and she choked back the overwhelming urge to hunt the man down and kill him like a rabid skunk.

The man had got away at the dam, running off into the dark when the police showed up, but, God help her, she was going to find him one day, and thenâ€”but this was not the day. The problem now was to stop himâ€”or Rob Cameronâ€”from getting anywhere near her kids again.

Then she got what Jemmy was saying and felt the chill sheâ€™d carried in her heart spread like hoarfrost through her body.

â€œYou mean there has to be another man,â€ she said, surprised at how calm she sounded. â€œMr. Cameron, the man at the damâ€”and whoever let Mr. Cameron out of the priestâ€™s hole.â€

â€œIt could be a lady,â€ Jemmy pointed out. He seemed less scared, talking about it. That was a good thing, because her own skin was rippling with fear.

â€œDo you know what Grannie calledâ€”callsâ€”goose bumps?â€ She held out her arm, the fine reddish hairs all standing on end. â€œHorripilation.â€

â€œHorripilation,â€ Jemmy repeated, and gave a small, nervous giggle. â€œI like that word.â€

â€œMe, too.â€ She took a deep breath and stood up. â€œGo pick out a change of clothes and your PJs, would you, sweetheart? I have to make a couple of phone calls, and then I think weâ€™re going to go visit Auntie Fiona.â€





ITâ€™S BEST TO SLEEP IN A HALE SKIN

ROGER WOKE SUDDENLY, but without shock. No sense of abandoned dreams, no half-heard noise, but his eyes were open and he was fully aware. It was perhaps an hour before sunrise. Heâ€™d left the shutters open; the room was cold and the clouded sky the color of a black pearl.



He lay motionless, listening to his heart beat, and realized that for the first time in several days it wasnâ€™t pounding. He wasnâ€™t afraid. The fear and turmoil of the night, the terror of the last few days, had vanished. His body was completely relaxed; so was his mind.

There was something floating in his mind. Absurdly, it was a line from â€œJohnny Copeâ€: â€œItâ€™s best to sleep in a hale skin; for â€™twill be a bluidy morning.â€ Weirder still, he could hearâ€”could almost feelâ€”himself singing it, in his old voice, full of power and enthusiasm.

â€œNot that Iâ€™m ungrateful,â€ he said to the whitewashed ceiling beams, his morning voice cracked and rough. â€œBut what the hell?â€

He wasnâ€™t sure whether he was talking to God or to his own unconscious, but the likelihood of getting a straight answer was probably the same in either case. He heard the soft thud of a closing door somewhere below and someone outside whistling through his or her teethâ€”Annie or Senga, maybe, on the way to the morning milking.

A knock came on his own door: Jenny Murray, tidy in a white pinny, dark curly hair tied back but not yet capped for the day, with a jug of hot water, a pot of soft soap, and a razor for shaving.

â€œDa says can ye ride a horse?â€ she said without preamble, looking him up and down in an assessing sort of way.

â€œI can,â€ he replied gruffly, taking the towel-wrapped jug from her. He needed badly to clear the phlegm from his throat and spit but couldnâ€™t bring himself to do that in front of her. Consequently, he just nodded and muttered, â€œTaing,â€ as he took the razor, instead of asking why.

â€œBreakfastâ€™ll be in the kitchen when you are,â€ she said matter-of-factly. â€œBring the jug down, aye?â€



AN HOUR LATER, filled to bursting with hot tea, parritch, bannocks with honey, and black pudding, he found himself on an autumn-shaggy horse, following Brian Fraser through the rising mist of early morning.

â€œWeâ€™ll go round to the crofts nearby,â€ Fraser had told him over breakfast, spooning strawberry preserves onto a bannock. â€œEven if no oneâ€™s seen your ladâ€”and to be honest,â€ his wide mouth twisted in apology, â€œI think I should haâ€™ heard already if anyone had seen a stranger in the districtâ€”theyâ€™ll pass on the word.â€

â€œAye, thanks very much,â€ heâ€™d said, meaning it. Even in his own time, gossip was the fastest way of spreading news in the Highlands. No matter how fast Rob Cameron might travel, Roger doubted he could outpace the speed of talk, and the thought made him smile. Jenny caught it and smiled back sympathetically, and he thought again what a very pretty lass she was.

The sky was still low and threatening, but impending rain had never yet deterred anyone in Scotland from doing anything and wasnâ€™t likely to start now. His throat felt much better for the hot tea, and the odd sense of calm with which heâ€™d waked was still with him.

Something had changed in the night. Maybe it was sleeping in Lallybroch, among the ghosts of his own future. Perhaps that had settled his mind while he slept.

Maybe it was answered prayer and a moment of grace. Maybe it was no more than Samuel Beckettâ€™s bloody existential I canâ€™t go on; Iâ€™ll go on. If he had a choiceâ€”and he did, Beckett be damnedâ€”heâ€™d go with grace.

Whatever had caused it, he wasnâ€™t disoriented any longer, thrown off-balance by what he knew about the futures of the people around him. There was still a deep concern about themâ€”and the need to find Jem still filled him. But now it was a quiet, hard thing in his core. A focus, a weapon. Something to brace his back against.

He straightened his shoulders as he thought this and, at the same time, saw Brianâ€™s straight, flat back and the broad, firm shoulders under the dark sett of his tartan coat. They were the echo of Jamieâ€™sâ€”and the promise of Jemâ€™s.

Life goes on. It was his job above all to rescue Jem, as much for Brian Fraserâ€™s sake as for his own.

And now he knew what had changed in him and gave thanks to God for what was indeed grace. Heâ€™d sleptâ€”and wakedâ€”in a whole skin. And however bloody the mornings to come, he had direction now, calmness and hope, because the good man who rode before him was on his side.



THEY VISITED MORE than a dozen crofts in the course of the day and stopped a tinker they met along the way, as well. No one had seen a stranger recently, with or without a red-haired lad, but all promised to spread the word and all without exception offered their prayers for Roger and his quest.

They stopped for supper and the night with a family named Murray that had a substantial farmhouse, though nothing to rival Lallybroch. The owner, John Murray, turned out in the course of conversation to be Brian Fraserâ€™s factorâ€”the overseer of much of the physical business of Lallybrochâ€™s estateâ€”and he lent his grave attention to Rogerâ€™s story.

An elderly, long-faced man with rawboned, muscular arms, he sucked his teeth consideringly, nodding his head.

â€œAye, Iâ€™ll send one of my lads down in the morn,â€ he said. â€œBut if yeâ€™ve found nay trace oâ€™ this fellow up along the Hieland passes . . . might be as ye should go down to the garrison and tell your tale, Mr. MacKenzie.â€

Brian Fraser cocked a dark brow, half-frowning at this, but then nodded.

â€œAye, thatâ€™s no a bad thought, John.â€ He turned to Roger. â€œItâ€™s some distance, kenâ€”the garrisonâ€™s in Fort William, down by Duncansburgh. But we can ask along our way, and the soldiers send messengers regularly betwixt the garrison, Inverness, and Edinburgh. Should they hear a thing about your man, they could get word to us swiftly.â€

â€œAnd they could maybe arrest the fellow on the spot,â€ Murray added, his rather melancholy countenance brightening a bit at the idea.

â€œMoran taing,â€ Roger said, bowing a little to them both in acknowledgment, then turning to Fraser. â€œIâ€™ll do that, and thanks. But, sirâ€”ye needna go with me. Youâ€™ve business of your own to tend to, and I wouldnaâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™ll come, and glad to,â€ Fraser interrupted him firmly. â€œThe hayâ€™s long since in and naught to do that John canna take care of for me.â€

He smiled at Murray, who made a small noise, halfway between a sigh and a cough, but nodded.

â€œFort Williamâ€™s in the midst of the Cameronsâ€™ land, forbye,â€ Murray observed absently, gazing off toward the dark fields. They had dined with his family but then come out to the dooryard, ostensibly to share a pipe; it smoldered in Murrayâ€™s hand, disregarded for the moment.

Brian made a noncommittal sound in his throat, and Roger wondered just what Murray meant. Was it a warning that Rob Cameron might have relatives or allies to whom he was heading? Or was there some tension or difficulty between some of the Camerons and the Frasers of Lovatâ€”or between the Camerons and the MacKenzies?

That presented some difficulty. If there was a feud of any importance going on, Roger ought already to know about it. He gave a small, grave â€œhmpâ€ himself and resolved to approach any Camerons with caution. At the same time . . . was Rob Cameron intending to seek refuge or help with the Camerons of this time? Had he maybe come to the past before and had a hiding place prepared among his own clan? That was an evil thought, and Roger felt his stomach tighten as though to resist a punch.

But no; there hadnâ€™t been time. If Cameron had only learned about time travel from the guide Roger had written for his childrenâ€™s eventual use, he wouldnâ€™t have had time to go to the past, find ancient Camerons, and . . . no, ridiculous.

Roger shook off the tangle of half-formed thoughts as though they were a fishing net thrown over his head. There was nothing more to be done until they reached the garrison tomorrow.

Murray and Fraser were leaning on the fence now, sharing the pipe and chatting casually in Gaelic.

â€œMy daughter bids me ask after your son,â€ Brian Fraser said, with an air of casualness. â€œAny word?â€

Murray snorted, smoke purling from his nostrils, and said something very idiomatic about his son. Fraser grimaced in sympathy and shook his head.

â€œAt least ye ken heâ€™s alive,â€ he said, dropping back into English. â€œLike enough, heâ€™ll come home when heâ€™s had his fill of fighting. We did, aye?â€ He nudged Murray gently in the ribs, and the taller man snorted again, but with less ferocity.

â€œIt wasna boredom that led us here, a dhuine dhubh. Not you, anyway.â€ He raised one shaggy graying brow, and Fraser laughed, though Roger thought there was a regretful edge in it.

He remembered the story very well: Brian Fraser, a bastard of old Lord Lovatâ€™s, had stolen Ellen MacKenzie from her brothers Colum and Dougal, the MacKenzies of Castle Leoch, and had ended up at last with her at Lallybroch, the pair of them more or less disowned by both clans but at least left alone by them. Heâ€™d seen the portrait of Ellen, tooâ€”tall, red-haired, and undeniably a woman worth the effort.

Sheâ€™d looked very much like her granddaughter Brianna. By reflex, he closed his eyes, breathed deep of the cold Highland evening, and thought he felt her there at his side. If he opened them again, might he see her standing in the smoke?

Iâ€™ll come back, he thought to her. No matter what, a nighean ruaidhâ€”Iâ€™m coming back. With Jem.





SANCTUARY

IT WAS NEARLY AN hourâ€™s drive over the narrow, twisting Highland roads from Lallybroch to Fiona Buchanâ€™s new house in Inverness. Plenty of time for Brianna to wonder if she was doing the right thing, if she had any right to involve Fiona and her family in a matter that looked more dangerous by the moment. Plenty of time to get a stiff neck from looking over her shoulderâ€”though if she was being followed, how would she know?

Sheâ€™d had to tell the kids where Roger was, as gently and briefly as possible. Mandy had put a thumb in her mouth and stared gravely at her, round-eyed. Jem . . . Jem hadnâ€™t said anything but had gone white under his freckles and looked as though he was about to throw up. She glanced in the rearview mirror. He was hunched in a corner of the backseat now, face turned to the window.

â€œHeâ€™ll come back, honey,â€ sheâ€™d said, trying to hug him in reassurance. Heâ€™d let her but stood stiff in her arms, stricken.

â€œItâ€™s my fault,â€ heâ€™d said, his voice small and wooden as a puppetâ€™s. â€œI should have got away sooner. Then Dad wouldnâ€™tâ€”â€

â€œItâ€™s not your fault,â€ sheâ€™d said firmly. â€œItâ€™s Mr. Cameronâ€™s fault and no one elseâ€™s. You were very brave. And Daddy will come back really soon.â€

Jem had swallowed hard but said nothing in reply. When sheâ€™d let him go, he swayed for a moment, and Mandy had come up and hugged his legs.

â€œDaddyâ€™ll come back,â€ she said encouragingly. â€œFor supper!â€

â€œIt might take a little bit longer than that,â€ Bree said, smiling in spite of the panic packed like a snowball under her ribs.

She drew a deep breath of relief as the highway opened out near the airport and she could go faster than 30 mph. Another wary glance in the mirror, but the road was empty behind her. She stepped on the gas.

Fiona was one of the only two people who knew. The other one was in Boston: her motherâ€™s oldest friend, Joe Abernathy. But she needed sanctuary for Jem and Mandy, right now. She couldnâ€™t stay with them at Lallybroch; the walls were two feet thick in places, yes, but it was a farm manor, not a fortified tower house, and hadnâ€™t been built with any notion that the inhabitants might need to repel invaders or stand off a siege.

Being in the city gave her a sense of relief. Having people around. Witnesses. Camouflage. Help. She pulled up in the street outside the Craigh na Dun Bed-and-Breakfast (three AA stars) with the sense of an exhausted swimmer crawling up onto shore.

The timing was good. It was early afternoon; Fiona would have finished the cleaning and it wouldnâ€™t yet be time to check in new guests or start the supper.

A little painted bell in the shape of a bluebell tinkled when they opened the door, and one of Fionaâ€™s daughters instantly popped an inquiring head out of the lounge.

â€œAuntie Bree!â€ she shouted, and at once the lobby was filled with children, as Fionaâ€™s three girls pushed one another out of the way to hug Bree, pick up Mandy, and tickle Jem, who promptly dropped to all fours and crawled under the bench where folk left their wraps.

â€œWhatâ€”oh, itâ€™s you, hen!â€ Fiona, coming out of the kitchen in a workmanlike canvas apron that said PIE QUEEN on the front, smiled with delight at sight of Bree and enveloped her in a floury hug.

â€œWhatâ€™s wrong?â€ Fiona murmured in her ear, under cover of the embrace. She drew back a bit, still holding Bree, and looked up at her, squinting in half-playful worry. â€œRog playing away from home, is he?â€

â€œYou . . . could say that.â€ Bree managed a smile but evidently not a very good one, because Fiona at once clapped her hands, bringing order out of the chaos in the lobby, and dispatched all the children to the upstairs lounge to watch telly. Jem, looking hunted, was coaxed out from under the bench and reluctantly followed the girls, looking back over his shoulder at his mother. She smiled and made shooing motions at him, then followed Fiona into the kitchen, glancing by reflex over her own shoulder.



THE TEAKETTLE SCREAMED, interrupting Brianna, but not before sheâ€™d got to the most salient point of her story. Fiona warmed and filled the pot, purse-lipped with concentration.

â€œYe say he took the rifle. Yeâ€™ve still got your shotgun?â€

â€œYes. Itâ€™s under the front seat of my car at the moment.â€

Fiona nearly dropped the pot. Brianna shot out an arm and grabbed the handle, steadying it. Her hands were freezing, and the warm china felt wonderful.

â€œWell, I wasnâ€™t going to leave it in a house the bastards have a key to, now, was I?â€

Fiona set down the pot and crossed herself. â€œDia eadarainnâ€™s an t-olc.â€ God between us and evil. She sat, giving Brianna a sharp look. â€œAnd yeâ€™re quite sure as itâ€™s bastards, plural?â€



â€œYes, I bloody am,â€ Bree said tersely. â€œEven if Rob Cameron managed to grow wings and fly out of my priestâ€™s holeâ€”let me tell you what happened to Jem at the dam.â€

She did, in a few brief sentences, by the end of which Fiona was glancing over her own shoulder at the closed kitchen door. She looked back at Bree, settling herself. In her early thirties, she was a pleasantly rounded young woman with a lovely face and the calm expression of a mother who normally has the Indian sign on her offspring, but at the moment she had a look that Briannaâ€™s own mother would have described as â€œblood in her eye.â€ She said something very bad in English regarding the man whoâ€™d chased Jem.

â€œSo, then,â€ she said, picking up a paring knife from the nearby drainboard and examining the edge critically, â€œwhat shall we do?â€

Bree drew a breath and sipped cautiously at the hot, milky tea. It was sweet, silky, and very comfortingâ€”but not nearly as comforting as that â€œwe.â€

â€œWell, firstâ€”would you let Jem and Mandy stay here while I go do a few things? It might be overnight; I brought their pajamas, just in case.â€ She nodded at the paper sack that sheâ€™d set down on one of the chairs.

â€œAye, of course.â€ A small frown formed between Fionaâ€™s dark brows. â€œWhat . . . sorts of things?â€

â€œItâ€™sâ€”â€ Brianna began, intending to say, â€œbetter if you donâ€™t know,â€ but in fact someone had better know where she was going and what she was doing. Just in case she didnâ€™t come back. A little bubble of what might be either fear or anger rose up through the sense of warmth in her middle.

â€œIâ€™m going to visit Jock MacLeod in hospital. Heâ€™s the night watchman who found Jem at the dam. He might know the man who hit him and tried to take Jem. And he does know Rob Cameron. He can maybe tell me who Cameronâ€™s mates are outside of work or in lodge.â€

She rubbed a hand down over her face, thinking.

â€œAfter that . . . Iâ€™ll talk to Robâ€™s sister and his nephew. If sheâ€™s not involved in whatever heâ€™s up to, sheâ€™ll be worried. And if she is involvedâ€”then I need to know that.â€

â€œDâ€™ye think yeâ€™ll be able to tell?â€ Fionaâ€™s frown had eased a bit, but she still looked worried.

â€œOh, yes,â€ Brianna said, with grim determination. â€œIâ€™ll be able to tell. For one thing, if someone I talk to is involved, theyâ€™re probably likely to try to stop me asking questions.â€

Fiona made a small noise that could best be spelled as â€œeeengh,â€ indicating deep concern.

Brianna drank the last of her tea and set down the cup with an explosive sigh.

â€œAnd then,â€ she said, â€œIâ€™m going back to Lallybroch to meet a locksmith and have him change all the locks and install burglar alarms on the lower windows.â€ She looked questioningly at Fiona. â€œI donâ€™t know how long it might take. . . .â€

â€œAye, thatâ€™s why ye brought the kidsâ€™ nighties. Nay problem, hen.â€ She chewed her lower lip, eyeing Brianna.

Bree knew what she was thinking, debating whether to ask or not, and saved her the trouble.



â€œI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do about Roger,â€ she said steadily.

â€œHeâ€™ll come back, surely,â€ Fiona began, but Bree shook her head. Horrifying Realization Number 3 couldnâ€™t be denied any longer.

â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ she said, though she bit her lip as if to keep the words from escaping. â€œHeâ€”he canâ€™t know that Jem isnâ€™t there. And heâ€™d never ab-abandon him.â€

Fiona was clasping Briannaâ€™s hand in both of her own.

â€œNo, no, of course he wouldna do that. But if he and the other fellow go on searching and find no trace . . . eventually, surely heâ€™d think . . .â€ Her voice died away as she tried to imagine what Roger might think under those circumstances.

â€œOh, heâ€™ll be thinking, all right,â€ Bree said, and managed a small, shaky laugh. The thought of Rogerâ€™s determination, the growing sense of fear and desperation that must inevitably eat away at it, his fight to keep goingâ€”because he would; heâ€™d never give up and come back to tell her Jem was lost for good. For if he didnâ€™t find any trace of Jem, what could he think? That Cameron had maybe killed Jem, hidden his body, and gone to America in search of the gold? Or that they had both been lost in that horrifying space between one time and another, never to be found?

â€œWell, and heâ€™ll be praying, too,â€ Fiona said with a brisk squeeze of Breeâ€™s hand. â€œI can help wiâ€™ that.â€

That made tears well, and she blinked hard, scrubbing at her eyes with a paper napkin.

â€œI canâ€™t cry now,â€ she said, in a choked voice. â€œI canâ€™t. I havenâ€™t got time.â€ She stood up suddenly, pulling her hand free. She sniffed, blew her nose hard on the napkin, and sniffed again.

â€œFiona . . . Iâ€”I know you havenâ€™t told anybody about . . . us,â€ she began, and even she could hear the doubt in her own voice.

Fiona snorted.

â€œI have not,â€ she said. â€œIâ€™d be taken off to the booby hatch, and what would Ernie do wiâ€™ the girls and all? Why?â€ she added, giving Brianna a hard look. â€œWhat are ye thinking?â€

â€œWell . . . the women whoâ€”who dance at Craigh na Dun. Do you think any of them know what it is?â€

Fiona sucked in one cheek, thinking.

â€œOne or two oâ€™ the older ones might have an idea,â€ she said slowly. â€œWeâ€™ve been callinâ€™ down the sun on Beltane there for as far back as anyone knows. And some things do get passed down, ken. Be strange if nobody ever wondered. But even if someone kent for sure what happens there, theyâ€™d not speakâ€”no more than I would.â€

â€œRight. I just wonderedâ€”could you maybe find out, quietly, if any of the women have ties to Rob Cameron? Or maybe . . . to the Orkneys?â€

â€œTo what?â€ Fionaâ€™s eyes went round. â€œWhy the Orkneys?â€

â€œBecause Rob Cameron went on archaeological digs there. And I think thatâ€™s what made him interested in stone circles to start with. I know one man named Callahan, a friend of Rogerâ€™sâ€”who worked up there with him, and Iâ€™ll talk to him, tooâ€”maybe tomorrow; I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll have time today. But if thereâ€™s anyone else who might be connected with things like that . . .â€ It was more than a long shot, but at the moment she was inclined to look under any stone she could lift.

â€œIâ€™ll call round,â€ Fiona said thoughtfully. â€œAnd speak of callingâ€”telephone me if yeâ€™re not coming back tonight, aye? Just so as I know yeâ€™re safe.â€

Bree nodded, her throat tight, and hugged Fiona, taking one more momentâ€™s strength from her friend.

Fiona saw her down the hall to the front door, pausing at the foot of the stair, and glanced toward the chatter coming from above. Did Bree want to say goodbye to Jem and Mandy? Wordless, Brianna shook her head. Her feelings were too raw; she couldnâ€™t hide them sufficiently and didnâ€™t want to scare the kids. Instead, she pressed her fingers to her lips and blew a kiss up the stairs, then turned to the door.

â€œThat shotgunâ€”â€ Fiona began behind her, and stopped. Brianna turned and raised an eyebrow.

â€œThey canna get ballistics off buckshot, can they?â€





AN GEARASDAN

THEY REACHED Fort William in early afternoon of the second dayâ€™s travel.

â€œHow large is the garrison?â€ Roger asked, eyeing the stone walls of the fort. It was modest, as forts went, with only a few buildings and a drill yard within the surrounding walls.

â€œMaybe forty men, Iâ€™d say,â€ Brian replied, turning sideways to allow a pair of red-coated guards carrying muskets to pass him in the narrow entry passage. â€œFort Augustus is the only garrison north of it, and thatâ€™s got maybe a hundred.â€

That was surprisingâ€”or maybe not. If Roger was right about the date, it would be another three years before there was much talk of Jacobites in the Highlandsâ€”let alone enough of it to alarm the English crown into sending troops en masse to keep a lid on the situation.

The fort was open, and any number of civilians appeared to have business with the army, judging from the small crowd near one building. Fraser steered him toward another, smaller one with a tilt of his head, though.

â€œWeâ€™ll see the commander, I think.â€

â€œYou know him?â€ A worm of curiosity tickled his spine. Surely it was too early forâ€”



â€œIâ€™ve met him the once. Buncombe, heâ€™s called. Seems a decent fellow, for a Sassenach.â€ Fraser gave his name to a clerk in the outer room, and within a moment they were ushered into the commanderâ€™s office.

â€œOh . . .â€ A small, middle-aged man in uniform with tired eyes behind a pair of half spectacles half-rose, half-bowed, and dropped back into his seat as though the effort of recognition had exhausted him. â€œBroch Tuarach. Your servant, sir.â€

Perhaps it had, Roger thought. The manâ€™s face was gaunt and lined, and his breath whistled audibly in his lungs. Claire might have known specifically what was up with Captain Buncombe, but it didnâ€™t take a doctor to know that something was physically amiss.

Still, Buncombe listened civilly to his story, called in the clerk to make a careful note of Cameronâ€™s description and Jemâ€™s, and promised that these would be circulated to the garrison and that any patrols or messengers would be advised to ask after the fugitives.

Brian had thoughtfully brought along a couple of bottles in his saddlebags and now produced one, which he set on the desk with a gurgling thump of enticement.

â€œWe thank ye, sir, for your help. If yeâ€™d allow us to present a small token of appreciation for your kindness . . .â€

A small but genuine smile appeared on Captain Buncombeâ€™s worn face.

â€œI would, sir. But only if you gentlemen will join me . . . ? Ah, yes.â€ Two worn pewter cups andâ€”after a brief searchâ€”a crystal goblet with a chip out of the rim were produced, and the blessed silence of the dram fell upon the tiny office.

After a few momentsâ€™ reverence, Buncombe opened his eyes and sighed.

â€œAmazing, sir. Your own manufacture, is it?â€

Brian inclined his head with a modest shake.

â€œNay but a few bottles at Hogmanay, just for the family.â€

Roger had himself seen the root cellar from which Brian had chosen the bottle, lined from floor to ceiling with small casks and with an atmosphere to it that would have knocked a moose flat had he stayed to breathe it long. But an instantâ€™s thought told him that it was probably wiser not to let a garrison full of soldiers know that you kept any sort of liquor in large quantities on your premises, no matter what terms you were on with their commander. He caught Brianâ€™s eye, and Fraser looked aside with a small â€œmmphmâ€ and a tranquil smile.

â€œAmazing,â€ Buncombe repeated, and tipped another inch into his glass, offering the bottle round. Roger followed Brianâ€™s lead and refused, nursing his own drink while the other two men fell into a sort of conversation he recognized very well. Not friendly but courteous, a trade of information that might be of advantage to one or bothâ€”and a careful avoidance of anything that might give the other too much advantage.

Heâ€™d seen Jamie do it any number of times, in America. It was headmanâ€™s talk, and there were rules to it. Of course . . . Jamie must have seen his da do it any number of times himself; it was bred in his bones.

He thought Jem maybe had it. He had something that made people look at him twiceâ€”something beyond the hair, he amended, and smiled to himself.

While Buncombe occasionally directed a question to him, Roger was for the most part able to leave them to it, and he gradually relaxed. The rain had passed, and a beam of sun from the window rested on his shoulders, warming him from without as the whisky warmed him within. He felt for the first time that he might be accomplishing something in his search, rather than merely flailing desperately round the Highlands.

â€œAnd they could maybe arrest the fellow,â€ John Murray had remarked, anent the soldiers and Rob Cameron. A comforting thought, that.

The clan angle, though . . . he didnâ€™t think Cameron could have accomplices here, butâ€”he straightened in his chair. He had an accomplice from this time, didnâ€™t he? Buck had the gene, and while it was clearly less frequent to travel forward from oneâ€™s original lifelineâ€”well, Roger thought it was less frequent (his own lack of knowledge was an unnerving realization in itself)â€”Buck had done it. If Cameron was a traveler, heâ€™d got the gene from an ancestor who could also have done it.

Chill was running through his veins like iced wine, killing the whiskyâ€™s warmth, and a sinister tangle of cold worms came writhing into his mind. Could it be a conspiracy, maybe, between Buck and Rob Cameron? Or Buck and some ancient Cameron from his own time?

Heâ€™d never thought Buck was telling the whole truth about himself or his own journey through the stones. Could all this have been a plot to lure Roger away from Lallybrochâ€”away from Bree?

Now the worms were bloody eating his brain. He picked up his cup and threw back the rest of the whisky at a gulp to kill them. Buncombe and Fraser both glanced at him in surprise but then courteously resumed their conversation.

In the cold light of his present state of mind, something else now cast new shadows. Brian Fraser. While Roger had taken Fraserâ€™s bringing him to the garrison as purely a helpful gesture toward finding Jem, it had another function, didnâ€™t it? It displayed Roger to Captain Buncombe, in a context that made it clear that he had no claim of clan obligation or personal friendship on Fraser, just in case Roger turned out not to be what he said he was. And it allowed Fraser to see whether Buncombe recognized Roger or not. Just in case he wasnâ€™t what he said he was.

He took a deep breath and pressed his hands on the desktop, concentrating on the feel of the wood grain under his fingers. All right. Perfectly reasonable. How many times had he seen Jamie do the same sort of thing? For these men, the welfare of their own people always came first; theyâ€™d protect Lallybroch, or Fraserâ€™s Ridge, above all, but that didnâ€™t mean they were unwilling to help when help was in their power to give.

And he did believe that Fraser meant to help him. He clung to the thought and found that it floated.

Fraser glanced at him again, and something in the manâ€™s face eased at whatever it saw in his own. Brian picked up the bottle and poured another inch into Rogerâ€™s glass.



â€œWeâ€™ll find him, man,â€ he said softly, in Gaelic, before turning to serve Captain Buncombe in turn.

He drank and put everything out of his mind, concentrating on the trivia of the conversation. It was all right. Everything was going to be all right.

He was still repeating this mantra to himself when he heard shouts and whistles from outside. He glanced toward the window, but it showed nothing save a view of the fortâ€™s wall. Captain Buncombe looked startledâ€”but Brian Fraser was on his feet, and moving fast.

Roger followed, emerging into the fortâ€™s drill yard to see a fine-looking young woman mounted on a large, fine-looking horse and glaring down at a small cluster of soldiers who had gathered round her stirrup, pushing one another, snatching at the reins, and shouting remarks up at her. The horse plainly didnâ€™t like it, but she was managing to keep it under control. She was also holding a switch in one hand and, from the look on her face, was plainly choosing a target amongst those presenting themselves.

â€œJenny!â€ Brian roared, and she looked up, startled. The soldiers were startled, too; they turned and, seeing Captain Buncombe come out behind the Scot, instantly melted away, heads down as they hurried off about their business.

Roger was at Brianâ€™s shoulder when he grabbed the horseâ€™s bridle.

â€œWhat in the name of the Blessed Mother are youâ€”â€ Brian began, furious, but she interrupted him, looking straight at Roger.

â€œYour kinsman,â€ she said. â€œWilliam Buccleigh. He sent word to Lallybroch that heâ€™s taken bad and will ye come at once. They said he may not live.â€



IT TOOK A good day and a half to make the journey, even in good weather. Given that it was raining, that the journey back was uphill, and that the latter portion of it involved stumbling around in the dark, hunting for a nearly invisible trail, they covered the distance in a surprisingly short time.

â€œIâ€™ll come in with ye,â€ Brian had said, swinging off his horse in the dooryard. â€œTheyâ€™re no my tenants, but they know me.â€

The householdâ€”it was a modest crofterâ€™s cottage, dull white as a pebble in the light of a gibbous moonâ€”was closed up tight for the night, shutters drawn and the door bolted. Fraser thumped on the door and shouted in Gaelic, though, identifying himself and saying that heâ€™d brought the sick manâ€™s kinsman to him, and presently the door swung open, framing a squat, bearded gentleman in shirt and nightcap, who peered at them for a long moment before stepping back with a gruff â€œCome ben.â€

Rogerâ€™s first impression was that the house was crammed to the rafters with odorous humanity. These lay in small snuggled heaps on the floor near the hearth or on pallets by the far wall, and here and there tousled heads poked up like prairie dogs, blinking in the glow of the smoored fire to see what was to do.

Their hostâ€”introduced by Fraser as Angus MacLarenâ€”nodded curtly to Roger and gestured toward a bedstead drawn into the center of the room. Two or three small children were sleeping on it, but Roger could just make out the blur of Buckâ€™s face on the pillow. Christ, he hoped Buck didnâ€™t have anything contagious.

He leaned in close, whispering, â€œBuck?â€ so as not to wake anyone who hadnâ€™t waked already. He couldnâ€™t make out much of Buckâ€™s face in the gloomâ€”and it was covered with beard stubble, as wellâ€”but his eyes were closed, and he didnâ€™t open them in response to Rogerâ€™s saying his name. Nor in response to Rogerâ€™s laying a hand on his arm. The arm did feel warm, but given the suffocating atmosphere in the cottage, he thought it likely Buck would feel warm even if heâ€™d been dead for hours.

He squeezed the arm, lightly at first, then harderâ€”and at last Buck gave a strangled cough and opened his eyes. He blinked slowly, not seeming to recognize Roger, then closed them again. His chest heaved visibly, though, and he breathed now with a slow, clearly audible gasping note.

â€œHe says as thereâ€™s something the matter wiâ€™ his heart,â€ MacLaren told Roger, low-voiced. He was leaning over Rogerâ€™s shoulder, watching Buck intently. â€œIt flutters, like, and when it does, he goes blue and canna breathe or stand up. My second-eldest lad found him out in the heather yesterday afternoon, flat as a squashed toad. We fetched him down and gave him a bit to drink, and he asked would we send someone to Lallybroch to ask after his kinsman.â€

â€œMoran taing,â€ said Roger. â€œIâ€™m that obliged to ye, sir.â€ He turned to Brian, who was lurking behind MacLaren, looking at Buck with a small frown.

â€œAnd thank ye, too, sir,â€ Roger said to him. â€œFor all your help. I canâ€™t thank ye enough.â€

Fraser shrugged, dismissing this.

â€œI imagine yeâ€™ll stay with him? Aye. If heâ€™s able to travel in the morn, bring him along to Lallybroch. Or send, if thereâ€™s aught we can do.â€ Fraser nodded to MacLaren in farewell but then paused, squinting through the murk at Buckâ€™s face. He glanced at Roger, as though comparing their features.

â€œIs your kinsman from Lochalsh, as well?â€ he asked, curious, and looked back at Buck. â€œHeâ€™s the look of my late wifeâ€™s people about him. The MacKenzies of Leoch.â€ Then he noticed the small squat shape of what must be Mrs. MacLarenâ€”glowering under her capâ€”and he coughed, bowed, and took his leave without waiting for an answer.

Mr. MacLaren went to bolt the door, and the lady of the house turned to Roger, yawned cavernously, then motioned toward the bed, scratching her bottom unself-consciously.

â€œYe can sleep wiâ€™ him,â€ she said. â€œPush him oot the bed if he dies, aye? I dinna want ma quilts all spoilt.â€



HAVING TAKEN OFF his boots, Roger lay down gingerly on the quilt beside Buckâ€”readjusting the position of the small children, who were limp and flexible as cats in sunshineâ€”and spent the remainder of the night listening to his ancestorâ€™s irregular snoring, poking him whenever it seemed to stop. Toward dawn, though, he dozed off, to be waked sometime later by the thick warm smell of porridge.

Alarmed by the fact that heâ€™d fallen asleep, he raised up on one elbow to find Buck pale-faced and breathing stertorously through his mouth. He seized his ancestor by the shoulder and shook him, causing Buck to start up in bed, glaring wildly round. Spotting Roger, he punched him solidly in the stomach.

â€œBugger off wiâ€™ that!â€

â€œI just wanted to be sure you were alive, you bastard!â€

â€œWhat are ye doing here in the first place?â€ Buck rubbed a hand through his disheveled hair, looking cross and confused.

â€œYe sent for me, fool.â€ Roger was cross, too. His mouth felt as though heâ€™d been chewing straw all night. â€œHow are you, anyway?â€

â€œIâ€”not that well.â€ Buckâ€™s face changed abruptly from crossness to a pale apprehension, and he put a hand flat on his chest, pressing hard. â€œIâ€”itâ€”it doesna feel right.â€

â€œLie down, for Godâ€™s sake!â€ Roger squirmed off the bed, narrowly avoiding stepping on a little girl who was sitting on the floor, playing with the buckles of his boots. â€œIâ€™ll get ye some water.â€

A row of children was watching this byplay with interest, ignored by Mrs. MacLaren and two of the older girls, who were respectively stirring a huge cauldron of parritch and rapidly laying the large table for breakfast, slapping down wooden plates and spoons like cards in a game of old maid.

â€œIf ye need the privy,â€ one of the girls advised him, pausing in her rounds, â€œyeâ€™d best go now. Robbie and Sandyâ€™ve gone to tend the kine, and Stuartâ€™s no got his shoon on yet.â€ She lifted her chin toward a stripling of twelve or so, who was crawling slowly about on hands and knees, with one worn shoe in one hand, peering under the sparse furniture in search of its mate. â€œOhâ€”and since your kinsmanâ€™s lived the night, Daâ€™s gone for the healer.â€





THE SCENT OF A STRANGER

SHEâ€™D BROUGHT Jock MacLeod the traditional hospital present of grapes. And a bottle of eighteen-year-old Bunnahabhain, which had brightened his faceâ€”or what could be seen of it behind the bandage that wrapped his head and the bruising that narrowed both eyes to bloodshot slits.



â€œOh, Iâ€™m a bit peely-wally,â€ heâ€™d told her, wrapping the bottle in his dressing gown and handing it to her to stash in his bedside cabinet, â€œbut no bad, no bad. A wee dunt on the head, is all. Iâ€™m only glad the lad got away. Dâ€™ye ken how he came to be in the tunnel, lass?â€

Sheâ€™d given him the official version, listened patiently to his speculations, and then asked if heâ€™d maybe recognized the man who hit him?

â€œWell, I did, then,â€ Jock had said, surprising her. He leaned back on his pillows. â€œWhich is not to say as I know his name. But Iâ€™ve seen him, aye, often. He skippers a boat on the canal.â€

â€œWhat? A charter boat, or one of the Jacobite cruise boats?â€ Her heart beat faster. The Caledonian Canal, he meant. It ran from Inverness to Fort William and carried a huge amount of water traffic, much of it visible from the road.

â€œNice wee motor sailerâ€”must be a charter. I only noticed because my wifeâ€™s cousin has one like it; we went out wiâ€™ him the once. Ten-meter, I think it is.â€

â€œYou told the police, of course.â€

â€œI did, so.â€ He tapped blunt fingers on the coverlet, glancing sideways at her. â€œI described the man so well as I couldâ€”but, ken, he didna really look unusual. Iâ€™d know him againâ€”and maybe your wee lad wouldâ€”but I donâ€™t know as the polis would pick him out easy.â€

Sheâ€™d brought her Swiss Army knife out of her pocket as she talked, playing with it meditatively, flicking the blades open and shut. She opened the corkscrew, testing the sharp end of it with the ball of her thumb.

â€œDo you think you could maybe describe him to me? I draw a bit; I could make a stab at a picture.â€

He grinned at her, eyes disappearing into the bruised flesh.

â€œPour me a dram, lass, and weâ€™ll have a go.â€



BRIANNA REACHED Lallybroch again in the late afternoon, just in time for her four oâ€™clock appointment with the locksmith. A scrap of white tacked to the door fluttered in the autumn wind; she yanked it off and fumbled it open with chilled fingers.

Had an emergency call in Elgin; wonâ€™t be back â€™til late. Will call by in the morning. Apologies, Will Tranter

She crumpled the note and stuffed it into her jacket pocket, muttering under her breath. Bloody kidnapping rapist bastards walking in and out of her house like it was the public highway and this wasnâ€™t an emergency?

She hesitated, fingers wrapped around the big antique key in her pocket, looking up at the white-harled front of the house. The sinking sun flashed in the upper windows, glazing them with red, hiding whatever might be behind them. They had a key. Did she really want to go in there alone?

She glanced round, self-conscious, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. The home fields lay tranquil, the small flock of sheep already bedding down in the setting sun. She breathed deeply, turning from side to side as she would when hunting with Da in the North Carolina forest, as though she might catch the tang of deer on the breeze.

What was she looking for now? Exhaust fumes. Rubber, hot metal, unlaid dust in the air, the ghost of a car. Or maybe something else, she thought, remembering the stink of Rob Cameronâ€™s sweat. The scent of a stranger.

But the cold air brought her only the smell of dead leaves, sheep shit, and a hint of turpentine from the Forestry Commissionâ€™s pine plantation to the west.

Still. Sheâ€™d heard her father mention a feeling at the back of his neck when something was wrong, and she felt the hairs on her nape prickle now. She turned away, got back into her car, and drove off, glancing automatically behind her every few minutes. There was a petrol station a few miles up the road; she stopped there to call Fiona and say sheâ€™d pick the kids up in the morning, then bought a few snacks and drove back, taking the farm track that circled the far edge of Lallybrochâ€™s land and led up into the pine plantation.

At this time of year, it got dark by 4:30 P.M. Up the hillside, the track was no more than a pair of muddy ruts, but she bumped carefully along until she came to one of the clearings where the foresters piled slash for burning. The air was rough with the smell of wood fire, and a big blackened patch of earth and ember still sent up wisps of smoke, but all the fires were out. She drove the car behind a heap of fresh-cut branches, piled ready for the next day, and cut the ignition.

As she came down out of the plantation, carrying the shotgun in one hand, something large shot past her head in total silence, and she stumbled, gasping. An owl; it disappeared, a pale blur in the dark. In spite of her pounding heart, she was glad to see it. White animals were harbingers of good luck in Celtic folklore; she could use any luck going.

â€œOwls are keepers of the dead, but not just the dead. Theyâ€™re messengers between worlds.â€ For an instant Roger was next to her, solid, warm in the cold night, and she put out a hand by impulse, as though to touch him.

Then he was gone and she was standing alone in the shadow of the pines, looking toward Lallybroch, the shotgun cold in her hand. â€œIâ€™ll get you back, Roger,â€ she whispered under her breath, and curled her left hand into a fist, clenching the copper ring with which heâ€™d married her. â€œI will.â€ But first she had to make sure the kids were safe.

Night rose up around the house and Lallybroch faded slowly out of sight, a paler blotch against the dark. She checked the safety on the gun and moved silently toward home.



SHE CAME UP the hill behind the broch, as quietly as she could. The wind had come up, and she doubted anyone would hear her steps over the rustling of the gorse and dry broom that grew thick back here.

If they were waiting for her, wanting to do harm, surely theyâ€™d be in the house. But if they just wanted to know where she was . . . they might be watching the house instead, and this was the place to do it from. She paused by the wall of the broch and put a hand on the stones, listening. Faint rustling, punctuated by an occasional dovish coo. The bats would have gone out long since, hunting, but the doves were abed.

Pressing her back against the stones, she sidled around the broch, pausing near the door, and reached out a hand, groping for the latch. The padlock was cold in her hand; intact and locked. Letting out her breath, she fumbled the bunch of keys out of her pocket and found the right one by touch.

The sleeping doves erupted in a mad flutter when the wind from the open door whooshed up to the rafters where they roosted, and she stepped hastily back against the wall, out of the way of a pattering rain of panicked incontinence. The doves calmed in a moment, though, and settled down again in a murmurous rustle of indignation at the disturbance.

The upper floors had long since fallen in and the timbers cleared away; the broch was a shell, but a sturdy shell, its outer stones repaired over the years. The stair was built into the wall itself, the stone steps leading up between the inner and outer walls, and she broke the gun over her shoulder and went up slowly, feeling her way one-handed. There was a torch in her pocket but no need to risk using it.

A third of the way up, she took up station by a window slit that commanded a view of the house below. It was cold sitting on the stones, but her jacket was down-filled and she wouldnâ€™t freeze. She pulled a bar of Violet Crumble from her pocket and settled down to wait.

Sheâ€™d called the Hydro Board and asked for a weekâ€™s leave in order to deal with a family emergency. News of what had happened at the Loch Errochty dam last night had spread, so thereâ€™d been no difficulty, save in deflecting the flood of sympathetic exclamations and curious questionsâ€”all of which sheâ€™d claimed not to be able to answer, owing to the ongoing police inquiry.

The police . . . they might be of help. Jock had told them about the man at the dam; theyâ€™d be following that up. Sheâ€™d had to tell them about Rob Cameron. And, with some reluctance, sheâ€™d told them about his coming into the house and threatening her, since Mandy would likely blow the gaff about that. She told them about his open disgruntlement over having a woman supervisor and his harassing her at workâ€”though that seemed like a paltry motive for kidnapping a child. She hadnâ€™t mentioned most of the physical stuff, the priestâ€™s hole, or Cameronâ€™s assisted escape, though. Just said sheâ€™d hit himâ€”first with the letter box, and then with the cricket batâ€”and heâ€™d run away. Sheâ€™d gone with Mandy to find Jem, that being obviously more urgent than calling the police. The police didnâ€™t agree with that assessment, but they were British and thus polite about their disapproval.

Sheâ€™d said Cameron had told her where Jem was. If the police found him, he wasnâ€™t going to be in any position to contradict her. She did hope they picked him up. It might cause complications, but sheâ€™d feel safer if he wasnâ€™t wandering around loose. With her rifle. Possibly lurking in her house.

Her hand curled up in the deep pocket of her jacket, fingering the comforting shapes of a dozen shotgun shells.





COGNOSCO TE

THE HEALER ARRIVED in midafternoon. He was a short man but not slight; he looked like an amateur wrestler, with shoulders nearly as broad as Rogerâ€™s own. He didnâ€™t introduce himself but nodded politely to Mrs. MacLaren, his eyes flicking round the room in a brief, all-encompassing glance, then focused on Buck, who had fallen into an uneasy sleep and did not wake even to the disturbance caused by the healerâ€™s entrance.

â€œHe says his heartâ€”â€ Roger began awkwardly. The man glanced sharply sideways at him, then flicked a hand in dismissal and, walking over, peered closely at Buck for a moment. All the MacLarens waited in breathless silence, clearly expecting something spectacular.

The man nodded to himself, removed his coat, and turned back his shirtsleeves, displaying sun-browned forearms corded with muscle.

â€œWell, then,â€ he said, sitting down by the bed and laying a hand on Buckâ€™s chest. â€œLet meâ€”â€ His face went quite blank and he stiffened, his hand jerking back as though heâ€™d received an electric shock. He gave a quick, hard shake of the head and pulled Buckâ€™s shirt open, plunging both hands into the opening and laying them flat on Buckâ€™s laboring chest.

â€œJesu,â€ he whispered. â€œCognosco te!â€

Quite suddenly the hairs on Rogerâ€™s body lifted, prickling as though a thunderstorm was coming. The man had spoken in Latin, and what he had said was, â€œI know you!â€



THE MACLARENS ALL watched the healer work, with great respect and not a little awe. Roger, who had learned a good bit about the psychology of healing from Claire, was just as impressed. And, to be frank, scared shitless.

The healer had stood motionless for a long moment, hands on Buckâ€™s chest, his head thrown back and eyes closed, his face contorted in an expression of the deepest concentration, as though listening to something far, far off. He had murmured what Roger recognized as the Pater Nosterâ€”from the looks on the faces of the MacLarens, it might as well have been the Abracadabra. Then, keeping his hands in place, he had raised one thick forefinger and begun to tap, delicately, in a slow, regular rhythm, his finger rebounding each time as though he were striking a piano key.

Thup . . . thup . . . thup. It went on for a long time, so long that everyone in the room began to draw breath againâ€”even Buck, whose labored gasping began to ease, his lungs filling naturally again. Then it was two fingers, Thup-tup . . . thup-tup . . . thup-tup. Slow. Regular as a metronome. On and on and on and on . . . Soothing. Hypnotic. And Roger realized that the rhythm was that of a beating heartâ€”his own heart. Looking round the room at the wide eyes and slightly open mouths of the adenoidal MacLaren clan, he had the most peculiar sense that all their hearts were beating to precisely the same rhythm.

He knew they were breathing as one; he could hear the susurrus of indrawn breath and the sea-foam rush of exhalation. He knew itâ€”and was helpless to change his own rhythm, to resist the sense of unity that had formed insensibly among all the people in the cabin, from Angus MacLaren down to little Josephine, round-eyed as the rest in her motherâ€™s arms.

All of them were breathing, hearts beating as oneâ€”and somehow they were supporting the stricken man, holding him as part of a larger entity, embracing him, bracing him. Buckâ€™s injured heart lay in the palm of Rogerâ€™s hand: he realized it quite suddenly and, just as suddenly, realized that it had been there for some time, resting as naturally in the curve of his palm as rounded river rock, smooth and heavy. And . . . beating, in time with the heart in Rogerâ€™s chest. What was much stranger was that none of this felt in any way out of the ordinary.

Oddâ€”and impressiveâ€”as it was, Roger could have explained this. Mass suggestion, hypnosis, will and willingness. Heâ€™d done much the same thing himself any number of times, singingâ€”when the music caught the audience up with him, when he knew they were with him, would follow him anywhere. Heâ€™d done it once or twice, preaching; felt the people warm to him and lift him up as he lifted them. It was impressive to see it done so quickly and thoroughly without any sort of warm-up, thoughâ€”and much more disquieting to feel the effects in his own flesh. What was scaring him, though, was that the healerâ€™s hands were blue.

No doubt about it. It wasnâ€™t a trick of the lightâ€”there wasnâ€™t any to speak of, bar the dull glow of the smoored fire. It wasnâ€™t a huge thing; no fiery coruscations or neon. But a soft blue tinge had come up between the healerâ€™s fingers, crept over the backs of his handsâ€”and now spread in a faint haze around his hands, seeming to penetrate Buckâ€™s chest.

Roger glanced to one side, then the other, without moving his head. The MacLarens were paying rapt attention but showed no sign of seeing anything startling. They donâ€™t see it. The hairs on his forearms lifted silently. Why do I see it?

Thup-tup . . . thup-tup . . . thup-tup . . . Tireless, regularâ€”and yet Roger became aware of some subtle change. Not in the healerâ€™s rhythmâ€”that didnâ€™t vary at all. But something had shifted. He glanced down involuntarily into his palm, where he still imagined that Buckâ€™s heart lay, and was now scarcely surprised to see it there, a ghostly round object, transparent but pulsing gently, regularly. On its own.

Thup-tup . . . . . . thup-tup . . . . . . thup-tup. The healer now was following, not leading. Not slowing the beats but pausing for a longer period between them, letting Buckâ€™s heart beat alone between them.



At last, the faint sound stopped, and there was silence in the room for the length of three heartbeats. And then the silence popped like a soap bubble, leaving the onlookers blinking and shaking their heads, as those awakened from dreaming. Roger closed his empty hand.

â€œHeâ€™ll be all right,â€ the healer said to Mrs. MacLaren, in a matter-of-fact manner. â€œLet him sleep as long as he can, give him something to eat when he wakes up.â€

â€œMuch obliged, sir,â€ Mrs. MacLaren murmured. She patted Josephine, who had fallen asleep with her mouth open, a glimmering trail of saliva falling from the corner of her mouth to her motherâ€™s shoulder. â€œWill I make up a pallet for ye by the fire?â€

â€œAh, no,â€ the healer said, smiling. He shrugged back into his coat, put on his cloak, and reached for his hat. â€œIâ€™m staying no great distance away.â€

He went out, and Roger waited for a moment, just long enough for people to turn back to their own conversations, and then followed, shutting the door quietly behind him.



THE HEALER WAS a little way down the road; Roger saw the manâ€™s dark figure kneeling in prayer before a tiny shrine, the ends of his cloak fluttering in the wind. Roger came up to him slowly, hanging back so as not to disturb his devotionsâ€”and, on impulse, bowed his own head toward the small statue, so weathered as to be faceless. Take care of them, please, he prayed. Help me get back to themâ€”to Bree. That was all he had time for, before the healer rose to his feetâ€”but that was all he had to say, in any case.

The healer hadnâ€™t heard him; he rose and turned, surprised at seeing Roger but recognizing him at once. He smiled, a little wearily, clearly expecting some medical question of a private nature.

Heart thumping, Roger reached out and grasped the healerâ€™s hand. The manâ€™s eyes widened with shock.

â€œCognosco te,â€ Roger said, very softly. I know you.



â€œWHO ARE YE, then?â€ Dr. Hector McEwan stood squinting against the wind, his face wary but excited. â€œThe two of yeâ€”who are ye?â€

â€œI think ye maybe ken that better than I do,â€ Roger told him. â€œThatâ€”the light in your hands . . .â€

â€œYou could see it.â€ It wasnâ€™t a question, and the wary excitement in McEwanâ€™s eyes blazed into life, visible even in the dimming light.

â€œAye, I could. Where did ye . . .â€ Roger groped for the best way to ask, but, after all, how many ways were there? â€œWhen did ye come from?â€

McEwan glanced involuntarily over his shoulder toward the croft, but the door was shut, smoke pouring from the hole in the roof. It was beginning to rain, a premonitory pattering among the mounded heather near the path. He moved abruptly, taking Rogerâ€™s arm.



â€œCome,â€ he said. â€œWe canna be standing out here, dreich as it is; weâ€™ll catch our deaths.â€

â€œDreichâ€ was the word; the rain set to in good earnest and Roger was half soaked in minutes, having come out without hat or cloak. McEwan led the way quickly up a winding path through thickets of dark gorse, emerging onto a stretch of moorland where the remains of a tumbledown croft offered some shelter. The rooftree had been burned, and recently; the smell still lingered. A corner of thatch remained, though, and they huddled inside, close beneath its scanty protection.

â€œAnno Domini eighteen hundred and forty-one,â€ McEwan said matter-of-factly, shaking rain from his cloak. He looked up at Roger, one thick brow raised.

â€œNineteen hundred and eighty,â€ Roger replied, heart hammering. He cleared his throat and repeated the date; the cold had affected his throat, and the words emerged in a strangled croak. McEwan leaned close at the sound, peering at him.

â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ the man asked sharply. â€œYour voiceâ€”itâ€™s broken.â€

â€œItâ€™s nothâ€”â€ Roger began, but the healerâ€™s fingers were already groping behind his head, undoing his neckcloth in nothing flat. He closed his eyes, not resisting.

McEwanâ€™s broad fingers were cold on his neck; he felt the icy touch delicate on his skin as it traced the line of the rope scar, then firmer as the healer prodded gently round his damaged larynxâ€”it gave him an involuntary choking sensation, and he coughed. McEwan looked surprised.

â€œDo that again,â€ he said.

â€œWhat, cough?â€ Roger said, hoarse as a crow.

â€œAye, that.â€ McEwan fitted his hand snugly round Rogerâ€™s neck, just under the chin, and nodded. â€œOnce, then wait, then do it again.â€ Roger hacked obligingly, feeling a slight pain with each expulsion of breath where the healerâ€™s hand pressed. The manâ€™s face brightened with interest, and he removed his hand.

â€œDo you know what a hyoid bone is?â€

â€œIf I had to guess, itâ€™s something in the throat.â€ Roger cleared his throat hard and rubbed at it, feeling the roughness of the scar under his palm. â€œWhy?â€ He wasnâ€™t sure whether to be offended at the personal intrusion orâ€”something else. His skin tingled slightly where McEwan had touched it.

â€œItâ€™s just there,â€ the healer said, pressing with his thumb, high up under Rogerâ€™s chin. â€œAnd if it had been hereâ€â€”he moved the thumb down an inchâ€”â€œyouâ€™d have been dead, sir. Itâ€™s a fragile wee bone. Easy to strangle someone by breaking itâ€”with your thumbs or a rope.â€ He drew back a little, eyes intent on Rogerâ€™s; the curiosity was still plain on his face, but the wariness had returned. â€œAre you and your friend fleeing from . . . something? Someone?â€

â€œNo.â€ Roger felt at once very tired, the strain of everything catching up to him, and looked round for something to sit on. There was nothing but a few dark chunks of rock that had fallen from the cottageâ€™s wall when the burning thatch had been pulled down. He pushed two blocks together and sat on one, knees up round his ears. â€œIâ€”thisâ€”â€ He touched his throat briefly. â€œIt was a long time ago, nothing to do with what weâ€”weâ€”weâ€™re looking for my son. Heâ€™s only nine.â€

â€œOh, dearie me.â€ McEwanâ€™s broad face creased in sympathy. â€œHowâ€”â€

Roger lifted a hand. â€œYou first,â€ he said, and cleared his throat again. â€œIâ€™ll tell ye everything I know, but . . . you first. Please.â€

McEwan pursed his lips and glanced aside, thinking, but then shrugged and lowered himself, grunting, to his own rude seat.

â€œI was a doctor,â€ he said abruptly. â€œIn Edinburgh. I came up to the Highlands to shoot grouse with a friend. Do folk still do that, a hundred years hence?â€

â€œAye. Grouse are still tasty,â€ Roger said dryly. â€œIt was at Craigh na Dun that ye came through, then?â€

â€œYes, Iâ€”â€ McEwan halted abruptly, realizing what that question implied. â€œDear Lord in heaven, do ye mean to be telling me there are other places? Where . . . it happens?â€

â€œYes.â€ The hairs rippled on Rogerâ€™s arms. â€œFour that I know of; likely there are others. How many stone circles are there in the British Isles?â€

â€œIâ€™ve no idea.â€ McEwan was clearly shaken. He got up and went to the doorway, the jamb of it scorched and the lintel burned almost away. Roger hoped none of the stones above it would fall on the manâ€™s headâ€”at least not until he found out more.

Dr. McEwan stayed for a long time, staring out into the rain, which had gone the silvery gray of catâ€™s fur. Finally he shook himself and came back, mouth set in firm decision.

â€œAye, nothing to be gained from secrecy. And I hope nothing to be lost by honesty.â€ This last was not quite a question, but Roger nodded and tried to look earnest.

â€œWell, then. Grouse, as I say. We were on the moor, just below that hill where the standing stones are. All of a sudden a fox shot out of the bracken, right by my foot, and one of the dogs lost his head and chased it. Brewerâ€”that was my friend, Joseph Brewerâ€”started after it, but he hasâ€”he had,â€ McEwan corrected, with an expression of mild irritation that made Roger want to smile, because he was so familiar with the feeling that dealing with the phenomenon caused, â€œa clubfoot. He managed all right with a special boot, but climbing and chasing . . .â€ He shrugged.

â€œSo you went after the dog, and . . .â€ Roger shuddered involuntarily at the memory, and so did McEwan.

â€œExactly.â€

â€œDid the dog . . . go?â€ Roger asked suddenly. McEwan looked surprised and vaguely affronted.

â€œHow should I know? It didnâ€™t turn up where I did, I can tell ye that much.â€

Roger made a brief gesture of apology.

â€œJust curious. Weâ€”my wife and Iâ€”weâ€™ve been trying to puzzle out as much as we can, for the sake of the children.â€ â€œChildrenâ€ caught in his throat, coming out in no more than a whisper, and McEwanâ€™s expression softened.

â€œAye, of course. Your son, you said?â€

Roger nodded and managed to explain what he could, about Cameron, the letters . . . and, after a momentâ€™s hesitation, about the Spaniardâ€™s gold, for, after all, heâ€™d have to give a reason for Cameronâ€™s taking Jem in the first place, and his sense of Dr. McEwan was one of solid kindness.

â€œDearie me,â€ the doctor murmured, shaking his head in dismay. â€œIâ€™ll ask among my patients. Perhaps someone . . .â€ He trailed off, his face still troubled. Roger had the distinct impression that the sense of trouble wasnâ€™t all down to Jem, or even to the staggering discovery that there were otherâ€”

He stopped, seeing plainly in his mindâ€™s eye the soft blue glow surrounding McEwanâ€™s fingersâ€”and the look of surprised delight on his face. Cognosco te. I know you. Delight, not just shock. He and Buck werenâ€™t the first time travelers this man had known. But the doctor hadnâ€™t said as much. Why not?

â€œHow long have you been here?â€ Roger asked, curious.

McEwan sighed and rubbed a hand over his face.

â€œMaybe too long,â€ he said, but then pushed that away, straightening up. â€œTwo years, about. Speaking of too long, though . . .â€ He straightened, pulling the cloak over his shoulders. â€œItâ€™ll be dark in less than an hour. Iâ€™ll need to go, if Iâ€™m to reach Cranesmuir by nightfall. Iâ€™ll come again tomorrow to tend your friend. We can talk a bit more then.â€

He turned abruptly, but just as suddenly turned back and, reaching out, took Rogerâ€™s throat in his hand.

â€œMaybe,â€ he said, as though to himself. â€œJust maybe.â€ Then he nodded once, let go, and was gone, his cloak fluttering like bat wings behind him.





THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST

AFTER FRAGGLE ROCK, the telly went to the evening news, and Ginger reached to turn it off but stopped abruptly as Jemâ€™s last yearâ€™s school picture flashed on the screen. She stared at the television, mouth half open, then looked incredulously at Jem.

â€œThatâ€™s you!â€ she said.

â€œKen that fine,â€ he said crossly. â€œTurn it off, aye?â€

â€œNo, I want to see.â€ She blocked him as he lunged for the screen; Ginger was eleven and bigger than him.

â€œTurn it off!â€ he said, then, with cunning inspiration, â€œItâ€™ll scare Mandy and sheâ€™ll howl.â€



Ginger shot Mandy a quick glanceâ€”she had good lungs, did Mandyâ€”then reluctantly turned the TV off.

â€œMmphm,â€ she said, and lowered her voice. â€œMam told us what happened, but she said we werenâ€™t to trouble ye about it.â€

â€œGood,â€ Jem said. â€œDonâ€™t.â€ His heart was hammering and he felt sweaty, but his hands were going cold and hot and cold again.

Heâ€™d got away by the skin of his teeth, diving under the bushes planted at the top of the spillway and crawling down the concrete edging â€™til he found a ladderway that went down into the water. Heâ€™d shoggled down it as far as he could and clung on so hard his hands went numb, with the black water rumbling inches under his feet and surging down the spillway past him, drenching him with cold spray. He could still feel his bones shake with it.

He believed he might throw up if he thought about it anymore, so he turned away and went to look into the wee girlsâ€™ toy chest. It was full of girlie toys, of course, but maybe if they had a ball . . . They did. It was pink but one of the good high-bouncy kind.

â€œWe could go out to the garden, maybe, and have a bit oâ€™ catch?â€ he suggested, bouncing the ball on the floor and catching it.

â€œItâ€™s dark and raininâ€™ like the clappers,â€ Tisha said. â€œDinna want to get wet.â€

â€œAch, itâ€™s no but a saft drizzle! What are ye, made of sugar?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Sheena, with a simper. â€œSugar and spice â€™n everything nice, thatâ€™s what little girls are made of. Snips and snails and puppy-dog tailsâ€”â€

â€œCome play dollies,â€ suggested Tisha, waggling a naked doll invitingly at him. â€œYe can have GI Joe if ye want. Or would ye rather Ken?â€

â€œNay, Iâ€™m no playinâ€™ dollies,â€ Jem said firmly. â€œCanna be doing wiâ€™ the clothes and all.â€

â€œI play dollies!â€ Mandy muscled her way between Tisha and Sheena, eager hands stretched out for a Barbie in a pink frilly ball gown. Sheena grabbed it away just in time.

â€œAye, aye,â€ she soothed Mandyâ€™s impending screech, â€œyou can play, sure. Ye have to play nice, though; ye dinna want to spoil her dress. Here, sit down, pet, Iâ€™ll give ye this one. See her wee comb and brush? Ye can fix her hair.â€

Jem took the ball and left. The upstairs hall had carpet, but the landing was bare wood. He popped the ball off it and it shot up and hit the ceiling with a smack, just missing the hanging light fixture. It bounced off the floor and he caught it before it could get away, clutching it to his chest.

He listened for a second, to be sure Mrs. Buchan hadnâ€™t heard. She was back in the kitchen, though; he could hear the sound of her singing along to the radio.

He was halfway down the stairs when the bell over the front door went, and he looked over the banister to see who it was coming in. Who it was was Rob Cameron, and Jem nearly swallowed his tongue.



JEM PRESSED himself back against the wall of the landing, his heart pounding so loud he could barely hear Mrs. Buchan come out of the kitchen.



Should he go get Mandy? There wasnâ€™t any way out of the house but by the stairs; he couldnâ€™t drop Mandy out the lounge window, there wasnâ€™t a tree or anything . . .

Mrs. Buchan was saying hello and she was sorry if the gentleman was wanting a room, because she was booked full every day this week. Mr. Cameron was being polite, saying, no, thank ye kindly, he was only wondering might he have a wee word . . .

â€œIf yeâ€™re selling anythingâ€”â€ she started, and he interrupted her.

â€œNo, missus, nothing like that. Itâ€™s a few questions I have about the stones at Craigh na Dun.â€

Jem was gasping for air. His lungs were heaving, but heâ€™d pressed a hand over his mouth so Mr. Cameron wouldnâ€™t hear. Mrs. Buchan didnâ€™t gasp, but he could hear her take breath, then stop, deciding what to say.

â€œStones?â€ she said, and even he could tell she was faking puzzlement. â€œI dinna ken anything about stones.â€

Rob made a polite laugh.

â€œI apologize, missus. I should have introduced myself, first. My nameâ€™s Rob Cameronâ€”andâ€”is something wrong, missus?â€ Sheâ€™d not only gasped really loud, Jem thought she must have stepped back without looking and hit the wee table in the hall, because there was a thump and an â€œAch!â€ and the splat of picture frames falling over.

â€œNo,â€ Mrs. Buchan said, getting ahold of herself. â€œNo. Had a wee turn, thatâ€™s allâ€”Iâ€™ve the high blood pressure, ken. Get that wee bit dizzy. Your nameâ€™s Cameron, is it?â€

â€œAye. Rob Cameron. Iâ€™m cousin by marriage to Becky Wemyss. She told me a bit about the dancing up at the stones.â€

â€œOh.â€ That â€œohâ€ meant trouble for Becky Wemyss, thought Jem, who knew a lot about mothersâ€™ voices.

â€œIâ€™m a bit of a scholar of the auld ways, see. Iâ€™m writing a wee book . . . Anyway, I wondered if I could maybe talk to you for a few minutes. Becky said yeâ€™d know more about the stones and the dancing than anybody else.â€

Jemâ€™s breathing slowed down, once he realized that Mr. Cameron hadnâ€™t come because Mr. Cameron knew Mandy and he were here. Or maybe he did and was trying it on with Mrs. Buchan â€™til he could make an excuse to use the loo and come poke round in search of them? He looked apprehensively up the half flight of stairs that led from the landing, but the lounge door above was closed, and while he could hear Mandyâ€™s giggling fine through it, probably Mr. Cameron couldnâ€™t.

Mrs. Buchan was taking Mr. Cameron back to the kitchen. Her voice when sheâ€™d said, â€œCome ben. Iâ€™ll tell ye what I can,â€ hadnâ€™t sounded at all friendly. Jem wondered whether she might be going to put rat poison in Mr. Cameronâ€™s tea.

Maybe Mrs. Buchan didnâ€™t have any rat poison, though. He took a step one way, then the other, then back. He really, really wanted to run down the stairs and out the door and keep going. But he couldnâ€™t leave Mandy.

His havering stopped at once when the kitchen door opened, but he could hear it was Mrs. Buchanâ€™s step, and just hers, coming fast and light.

She turned up the stairs but started back when she saw him on the landing, a hand to her chest. Then she ran up to him and hugged him tight, whispering in his ear.

â€œBloody heck, lad. Whatâ€™re youâ€”well, never mind, I was coming to find you. Ye saw him?â€

Jem nodded, wordless, and Mrs. Buchanâ€™s mouth pressed flat.

â€œAye. Iâ€™m going to take ye out the door. Go left out the gate. Two houses down is Mrs. Kelleher. Knock and tell her I sent ye to use the phone. Ye call the polis and tell them the man that kidnapped you is hereâ€”ye ken the address here?â€

He nodded. Heâ€™d seen the number when he visited before with Mam and Dad and remembered it because it was 669; Dad had said it should by rights be 666, but that was the number of the beast. Jem had asked whether it was Mr. or Mrs. Buchan that was the beast, and Mam and Dad both laughed like loons.

â€œGood,â€ said Mrs. Buchan, letting go of him. â€œCome on, then.â€

â€œMandyâ€”â€ he started, but she shushed him.

â€œIâ€™ll mind her. Come!â€

He ran down the stairs after her, trying not to make any noise, and, at the door, she stood on her toes and held the little bell so it wouldnâ€™t ring.

â€œRun!â€ she whispered.

He ran.



MRS. KELLEHER WAS an old lady and kind of deaf. Jem was out of breath and so scared that he couldnâ€™t put his words together right, so it was a long time before she took him to the telephone, and then the lady at the police station put the phone down on him twice, because she thought he was some bampot wean whoâ€™d got hold of the phone and was playing tricks.

â€œIâ€™m Jeremiah MacKenzie!â€ he bellowed, next time she answered. â€œI was kidnapped!â€

â€œYe were?â€ said Mrs. Kelleher, very startled. She grabbed the phone away from him. â€œWhoâ€™s this?â€ she demanded of it. Faint squawkingâ€”at least the police lady hadnâ€™t hung up again. Mrs. Kelleher turned and squinted through her spectacles at him.

â€œWho was it ye were wanting to call, lad? Yeâ€™ve got the polis by mistake.â€

He really wanted to hit something, but he couldnâ€™t hit Mrs. Kelleher. He said something very bad in Gaelic, and her mouth fell open. Sheâ€™d let the phone fall away from her ear, though, and he grabbed it.

â€œThe man that kidnapped me is here,â€ he said, as slow as he could. â€œI need somebody to come! Beforeâ€”â€ Inspiration struck. â€œBefore he hurts my little sister! Itâ€™s 669 Glenurquhart Road. Come right away!â€ Then he put the phone down, before the lady could ask him questions.

Mrs. Kelleher had plenty of those, and he didnâ€™t want to be rude, so he asked could he use the loo and locked the door against her, then hung out the upstairs window, watching for the police.

Nothing happened for what seemed forever. The raindrops started to drip off his hair and eyelashes, but he was afraid of missing anything. He was rubbing the water out of his eyes when all of a sudden the door of 669 flew open and Rob Cameron came running out, jumped in a car, and drove off with the tires squealing.

Jem almost fell out the window but then rushed back and barreled out of the bathroom, nearly knocking Mrs. Kelleher over.

â€œThank you, Mrs. Kelleher!â€ he yelled over his shoulder, taking the stairs three at a time, and shot out the front door.

There was a lot of screaming and crying going on inside the Buchansâ€™ house, and he felt his chest go so tight he couldnâ€™t breathe.

â€œMandy!â€ He tried to call, but her name came out in a whisper. The front door was hanging open. Inside, there were girls everywhere, but he picked Mandy out of the muddle in the lounge instantly and ran to grab her. She wasnâ€™t crying, but she latched on to him like a leech, burying her black curly head in his stomach.

â€œItâ€™s okay,â€ he told her, squeezing the stuffing out of her in relief. â€œItâ€™s okay, Man. I gotcha. I gotcha.â€

His heart started to slow down a little, and he saw that Mrs. Buchan was sitting on the sofa, holding a towel full of ice cubes to her face. Some of the ice had fallen out and was lying on the rug at her feet. Tisha and Sheena were holding on to their mother and crying, and Ginger was trying to pat her mamâ€™s hair and comfort her sisters at the same time, but her face was dead white and tears were running silently down it.

â€œMrs. Buchan . . . are ye all right?â€ Jem asked timidly. He had an awful feeling in the bottom of his stomach. Somehow, he was sure this was his fault.

Mrs. Buchan looked up at him. One side of her face was puffy and the eye on that side was swollen half shut, but the other one had fire in it, and that made him feel a little better.

â€œAye, fine, Jem,â€ she said. â€œDinna fash, girls! Itâ€™s well enough; no but a black eye. Quit your caterwauling, will ye? I canna hear myself think.â€ She gave a small, good-natured shake to detach the clinging girls, pushing and patting at them with her free hand. Then there was a knock on the doorjamb, and a manâ€™s voice from the front hall.

â€œPolice, here! Anyone to home?â€

Jem could have told Mrs. Buchan what happened once you called the police. Questions, and questions, and more questions. And if there were things you couldnâ€™t tell the police . . . At least Mrs. Buchan wouldnâ€™t let them take Jem or her to the police station to answer questions, insisting that she couldnâ€™t leave the girls on their own. By the time the police gave up, Mandy and Sheena were both asleep on the couch, curled up together like a pair of kittens, and Ginger and Tisha had made everyone tea, then sat yawning in the corner together, blinking now and then to keep awake.

A few minutes after the police left, Mr. Buchan came home for his supper, and all the explaining was to do all over again. There really wasnâ€™t much to it: Mrs. Buchan had sat Mr. Cameron down in the kitchen and told him a bit about the dancingâ€”it wasnâ€™t secret, most folk whoâ€™d lived in Inverness for a long time knew about itâ€”but sheâ€™d left the radio playing while they were talking, and all of a sudden the newscaster was saying the name â€œRobert Cameronâ€ and how Robert Cameron was wanted for questioning in the kidnapping of a local boy, andâ€”

â€œAnd then the wee bastard jumps up, and so do I, and he must have thought I meant to stop himâ€”I was betwixt him and the door, anyroadâ€”and he belts me one in the eye, pushes me into the wall, and heâ€™s away off!â€

Mr. Buchan was giving Jem a hard look now and then and seemed like he wanted to start asking questions, but instead he said theyâ€™d all go into the town and have a fish supper as it was so late, and everyone started feeling better at once. Jem could see the looks going back and forth between the Buchans, though, and he kind of wondered whether Mr. Buchan maybe meant to drop him and Mandy off at the police station on the way back. Or maybe just leave them by the side of the road.





THE GHOST OF A HANGIT MAN

THE HEAVENS OPENED, and Roger was soaked to the skin by the time he got back to the MacLarensâ€™ cottage. Amid cries of dismay from Mrs. MacLaren and her ancient mother, he was hastily stripped, wrapped up snug in a ragged quilt, and stood to steam before the fire, where his presence greatly impeded the preparations for supper. Buck, propped up on pillows with the two smallest MacLarens curled up in sleep on the bed beside him, lifted a brow at Roger in inquiry.

Roger moved his hand slightly, in a tell-you-later gesture. He thought Buck looked better; there was color in his face, and he was sitting upright, not slumped into the bedding. For a brief instant, Roger wondered what would happen if he were to lay his own hand on Buck. Would it glow blue?

The thought sent a shiver through him, and Allie, one of the MacLaren daughters, pushed the trailing edge of his quilt away from the fire with a squeak of alarm.

â€œTake care, sir, do!â€

â€œAye, do,â€ said Grannie Wallace, pulling the blackened iron spiderâ€”this spitting hot greaseâ€”well away from his bare legs and making shooing motions. â€œTake a spark, and yeâ€™ll go up like tinder.â€ She was blind in one eye, but the other was sharp as a needle and gave him a piercing look. â€œTall as ye are, yeâ€™d likely set the rooftree afire, and then where should we all be, Iâ€™d like tae know!â€



There was a general titter at that, but he thought the laughter had an uneasy note to it and wondered why.

â€œMoran taing,â€ Roger said in polite thanks for the advice. He moved a foot or so farther from the hearth, fetching up against the settle on which Mr. Angus MacLaren was sitting, mending his pipe stem. â€œSince ye speak of rooftreesâ€”thereâ€™s a wee croft just over the hill thatâ€™s been burnt out. Cooking accident, was it?â€

The room went silent, and people froze for an instant, all looking at him.

â€œEvidently not,â€ he said, with an apologetic cough. â€œIâ€™m sorry to make lightâ€”were folk killed, then?â€

Mr. MacLaren gave him a brooding sort of look, quite at odds with his earlier geniality, and set the pipe on his knee.

â€œNo by the fire,â€ he said. â€œWhat led ye up there, man?â€

Roger met MacLarenâ€™s eye directly.

â€œSearching for my lad,â€ he said simply. â€œI dinna ken where to lookâ€”so I look everywhere. Thinkinâ€™ what if heâ€™s got away, what if heâ€™s wandering about by himself . . . maybe taking shelter where he can find it . . .â€

MacLaren took a deep breath and sat back, nodding a little.

â€œAye, well. Yeâ€™ll want to keep well away from that croft.â€

â€œHaunted, is it?â€ Buck asked, and all heads swung round to look at himâ€”then swung back to Mr. MacLaren, waiting for him to give the answer.

â€œIt might be,â€ he said, after a reluctant pause.

â€œItâ€™s cursed,â€ Allie whispered to Roger under her breath.

â€œYe didna go in, sir, did ye?â€ said Mrs. MacLaren, the permanent worry crease deepening between her brows.

â€œOch, no,â€ he assured her. â€œWhat was it happened there?â€ McEwan hadnâ€™t had any hesitation about going into the croft; did he not know whatever they were concerned about?

Mrs. MacLaren made a small â€œMmp!â€ noise and, with a shake of her head, swung the cauldron out on its bracket and began to scoop out boiled neeps with a wooden spoon. Not her place to speak of such goings-on, said her primly sealed mouth.

Mr. MacLaren made a somewhat louder noise and, leaning forward, got ponderously to his feet.

â€œIâ€™ll just be going to check the beasts before supper, ken,â€ he said, and gave Roger an eye. â€œPerhaps yeâ€™d like to come along and be oot the way oâ€™ the lasses and their doings.â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ Roger said, and, with a small bow to Mrs. MacLaren, hitched the quilt up higher over his shoulders and followed his host into the byre. He caught Buckâ€™s eye in passing and gave him a brief shrug.

In the usual way, the cattleâ€™s quarters were separated from the peopleâ€™s by no more than a stone wall with a large space at the top, allowing the considerable heatâ€”along with floating bits of straw and a strong scent of piss and manureâ€”generated by several large cows to percolate into the ben. The MacLarensâ€™ was a snug byre, well kept and piled with clean straw at one end, with three fat, shaggy red cows and a diminutive black bull who snorted fiercely at Roger, nostrils red-black in the dim light and the brass ring in his nose agleam.



The ben of the croft was far from coldâ€”what with nine people crammed into it and a good peat fire on the hearthâ€”but the byre was filled with an encompassing warmth and a sense of peace that made Roger sigh and drop his shoulders, only then realizing that theyâ€™d been up round his ears for what seemed hours.

MacLaren made no more than a cursory check of his beasts, scratching the bull between the ears and administering a comforting slap to a cowâ€™s flank. Then he led Roger to the far end of the byre with a jerk of his head.

Ever since his conversation with Hector McEwan, Roger had had an uneasy feeling, caused by something he felt he had heard and not understood. And now, as MacLaren turned to speak to him, it was there suddenly, clear in his head. Cranesmuir.

â€œTwa strangers built the croft up there,â€ MacLaren said. â€œThey came from nowhere seemingly; just one day they were there. A man and a woman, but we couldna tell were they man and wife, or maybe a man and his daughter, for he seemed a good bit older than she did. They said they came from the islesâ€”and I think he maybe did, but her speech wasna like any islander Iâ€™ve heard.â€

â€œWas she Scots?â€

MacLaren looked surprised.

â€œOh, aye, she was. She had the GÃ idhlig. Iâ€™d have said she came from somewhere up northwest of Invernessâ€”maybe Thursoâ€”but there again . . . it wasna quite . . . right.â€

Not quite right. Like someone out of their proper place, pretending.

â€œWhat did she look like?â€ Roger said. His voice was thick; he had to clear his throat and repeat himself.

MacLarenâ€™s lips pursed but not in condemnation; it was the sort of soundless whistle of appreciation one gives at sight of something remarkable.

â€œBonny,â€ he said. â€œVerra bonny, indeed. Tall and straight, but . . . er . . . not so straight in places, if ye take my meaning.â€ He ducked his head, half embarrassed, and Roger realized that his reluctance to talk in front of the womenfolk perhaps wasnâ€™t due entirely to the scandalous nature of his story.

â€œI do,â€ Roger said, lowering his own voice to MacLarenâ€™s confidential level. â€œDid they keep to themselves, then?â€ If they hadnâ€™t, surely the whole district would have known about them and quickly discovered whether they were man and wife.

MacLaren frowned.

â€œAye, they did . . . though he was friendly enough; I met him now and again, out on the moor, and weâ€™d have a word, and Iâ€™d always come away thinkinâ€™ as how he was a good wee fellow, and yet when I came to tell my Maggie about it, I couldna just charge my memory wiâ€™ anything heâ€™d said.â€

MacLaren said somehow word got round that the woman was something that wee bit oddâ€”a root doctor, but maybe would give you a bit more than a grass cure, if you found her alone in the house. . . .

There was no light in the byre save the dull glow from the hearth fire next door, but, even so, Roger could see that MacLaren had grown flushed and discomfited. Roger was beginning to feel uncomfortable himself, but not for the same reason.



Cranesmuir. He knew the name, had known it when McEwan said it. The MacLarens had said the healer came from Draighhearnach. Cranesmuir was in the opposite directionâ€”and two miles farther on. Why was he going there tonight?

â€œThere were stories. Always are, about a woman like that.â€ MacLaren cleared his own throat. â€œBut she was good wiâ€™ the grass curesâ€”and wiâ€™ charms, as well. Or so folk said.â€

But then the man had gone, MacLaren said. No one knew where; they just didnâ€™t see him anymore, and the woman went on as before, but now more of her visitors were men. And the women stopped taking their bairns up there, though theyâ€™d go sometimes themselves, quietly, in secret.

And then on the day before Samhain, as the sun was sinking and the great fires being built up for the evening, a woman from nearby had gone up to the lonely croft and run down again, screaming.

â€œSheâ€™d found the door oâ€™ the croft standing wide, the woman and her things all goneâ€”and a man hanging from the rooftree, stone dead wiâ€™ a rope around his neck.â€

The shock tightened Rogerâ€™s own throat. He couldnâ€™t speak.

MacLaren sighed, head bent. A cow had come up behind him, nudging gently, and he laid one hand on her back as though seeking support from the animal, who went on placidly chewing her cud.

â€œIt was the priest who said we should cleanse the place with fire, for it had the smell of evil about it, and no one kent the man. We couldna tell was it just a poor fellow as took his life by despairâ€”or was it murder.â€

â€œI . . . see.â€ Roger forced the words through the burn in his throat, and MacLaren looked up suddenly at him. He saw the manâ€™s mouth drop open, his eyes bulging, and realized that in the warmth heâ€™d let the quilt slide back on his shoulders. MacLaren was looking straight at his throat, where the livid and unmistakable scar of hanging must show plain in the dim red light.

MacLaren backed away, or tried to, but there was nowhere to go. He plastered himself against one beastâ€™s shaggy flank, making a low gobbling noise. The cow seemed annoyed by this and brought her hoof down solidly on MacLarenâ€™s foot. The consequent anguish and fury at least brought MacLaren out of his fright, and when he had extricated himselfâ€”by means of thumps and cursesâ€”he turned bravely on Roger, jaw thrust out.

â€œWhy come ye here, a thaibse?â€ he said, fists clenched but his voice low. â€œWhatever sin I might have done, I did naught to you. Iâ€™d nay part in your deathâ€”and I said they must bury your body beneath the hearthstone before they fired the place. The priest wouldna have ye in the kirkyard, aye?â€ he added, evidently fearing that the ghost of the hangit man had come to complain about the unsancitifed disposal of his mortal remains.

Roger sighed and rubbed a hand over his face, the stubble rasping against his palm. He could see several curious faces, attracted by MacLarenâ€™s cries, peering into the shadows of the byre from the glow of the room beyond.

â€œHave ye got a rosary in the house, sir?â€ he said.





IT WAS A long and restless night. Grannie Wallace had snatched the children off Buckâ€™s bed, as though fearing he might devour them the moment her back was turned, and put them to bed with her in the trundle, while the older children slept either with their parents or rolled up in quilts by the hearth. Roger shared the pariahâ€™s bed with Buck, for while his ability to hold the rosary in his hand, kiss the crucifix, and then lead the family in saying the rosary hadâ€”barelyâ€”kept Angus MacLaren from throwing him out into the night and pissing on the gateposts to keep him from coming back in, it hadnâ€™t made him much more popular.

He doubted Buck had slept much better than himself, for his ancestor had rolled out of bed at first light, declaring an urgent necessity to visit the privy. Roger had as hastily arisen, saying, â€œIâ€™ll help ye,â€ and pulled on a still-damp shirt and breeks.

He was pleased to see that Buck didnâ€™t actually appear to need help. He walked stiffly and limped a little, but his shoulders were square and he wasnâ€™t gasping or turning blue.

â€œIf they think yeâ€™re a vengeful ghost, what the devil do they think I am?â€ Buck inquired, the instant they were clear of the cottage. â€œAnd surely to goodness ye could haâ€™ just said the Lordâ€™s Prayer once and not dragged everyone through five decades oâ€™ the rosary and ruined the supper!â€

â€œMmphm.â€ Buck had a point there, but Roger had been too much upset at the time to think of that. Besides, heâ€™d wanted to give them time to recover from the shock. â€œIt wasnâ€™t ruined,â€ he said crossly. â€œOnly the neeps a bit scorched.â€

â€œOnly!â€ Buck echoed. â€œThe place still reeks. And the women hate ye. Theyâ€™ll put too much salt in your porridge, see if they donâ€™t. Where dâ€™ye think weâ€™re going? Itâ€™s that way.â€

He pointed at a path on the left that did indeed lead to the privy, this sitting in plain sight.

Roger made another testy sound but followed. He was off-kilter this morning, distracted. No wonder about why, either.

Now? He wondered, watching the door of the privy close behind Buck. It was a two-seater, but he wasnâ€™t minded to broach what he had to say under conditions of that much intimacy, no matter how private the subject matter was.

â€œThe healer,â€ he said instead through the door, choosing the simplest place to start. â€œMcEwan. He said heâ€™d come back today to see to ye.â€

â€œI donâ€™t need seeing to,â€ Buck snapped. â€œIâ€™m fine!â€ Roger had known the man long enough to recognize bravado covering fear, and replied accordingly.

â€œAye, right. What did it feel like?â€ he asked curiously. â€œWhen he put his hand on you?â€

Silence from the privy.

â€œDid ye feel anything?â€ he asked, after the silence had lengthened well past any time required for natural functions.

â€œMaybe,â€ said Buckâ€™s voice, gruff and reluctant. â€œMaybe no. I fell asleep whilst he was tapping on my chest like a yaffle after tree grubs. Why?â€

â€œDid you understand what it was he said to ye? When he touched you?â€ Buck had been a lawyer in his own time; he must have studied Latin.

â€œDid you?â€ A slight creak of wood and a rustling of cloth.

â€œI did. And I said it back to him, just before he left.â€

â€œI was asleep,â€ Buck repeated doggedly. Clearly he didnâ€™t want to talk about the healer, but he wasnâ€™t going to have a choice about that, Roger thought grimly.

â€œCome out of there, will ye? The MacLarens are all out in the dooryard, crossing their legs.â€ He glanced over his shoulder and was surprised to see that in fact the MacLarens were out in the dooryard.

Not all of themâ€”it was only Angus and a tall boy, plainly a MacLaren, too, from the shape of him. He seemed familiarâ€”had he been at the house the evening before? They were bent close together, talking in evident excitement, and the boy was pointing off toward the distant road.

â€œCome out,â€ Roger repeated, sudden urgency in his voice. â€œSomeoneâ€™s coming. I hear horses.â€

The privy door flew open and Buck sprang out like a jack-in-the-box, stuffing his shirt into his breeks. His hair was matted and dirty, but his eyes were alert, and he looked entirely capable; that was reassuring.

The horses had come up over the brow of the hill nowâ€”six of them: four of the shaggy Highland ponies called garrons, one indifferent rangy bay, and a startlingly fine chestnut with a black mane. Buck seized Rogerâ€™s arm with a grip like a horseâ€™s bite.

â€œA Dhia,â€ Buck said, half under his breath. â€œWhoâ€™s that?â€





ANGELS UNAWARE

ROGER HAD NO IDEA who the tall man with the good horse was, but it was crystal clear what he was, both from the deferential manner of the MacLarens and from the way in which his companions fell naturally into place a step behind him. The man in charge.

A tacksman of the MacKenzies? he wondered. Most of the men wore a hunting tartan with a sett in green, brown, and white, but Roger wasnâ€™t yet familiar enough with the local patterns as to tell whether they came from somewhere close by or not.

The tall man glanced over his shoulder at MacLarenâ€™s nod, and his eyes rested on Roger and Buck with an air of casual interest. There was nothing threatening in his manner, but Roger felt himself draw up to his own full height and wished for an instant that he wasnâ€™t barefoot and unshaven, breeks flapping unbuckled at his knees.

At least he did have someone at his own back: Buck had fallen a step behind him. He hadnâ€™t time to be surprised at that before he came within the strangerâ€™s ken.

The man was an inch or two shorter than himself and close to his own age, dark and good-looking in a faintly familiar sort of . . .

â€œGood morn to ye, sir,â€ the dark man said, with a courteous inclination of the head. â€œMy name is Dougal MacKenzie, of Castle Leoch. And . . . who might you be?â€

Dear Jesus bloody hell, he thought. The shock rippled through him, and he hoped it didnâ€™t show on his face. He shook hands firmly.

â€œI am Roger Jeremiah MacKenzie, of Kyle of Lochalsh,â€ he said, keeping his voice mild andâ€”he hopedâ€”assured, as some compensation for his shabby appearance. His voice sounded nearly normal this morning; if he didnâ€™t force it, with luck it wouldnâ€™t crack or gurgle.

â€œYour servant, sir,â€ MacKenzie said with a slight bow, surprising Roger with his elegant manners. He had deep-set hazel eyes, which looked Roger over with frank interestâ€”and a faint touch of what appeared to be amusementâ€”before shifting to Buck.

â€œMy kinsman,â€ Roger said hastily. â€œWilliam Buâ€”William MacKenzie.â€ When? he thought in agitation. Was Buck born yet? Would Dougal recognize the name William Buccleigh MacKenzie? But, no, he canâ€™t be born yet; you canâ€™t exist twice in the same timeâ€”can you?!?

A question from Dougal MacKenzie interrupted this stream of confusion, though Roger missed hearing it. Buck answered, though.

â€œMy kinsmanâ€™s son was taken,â€ he said, looking Dougal over with exactlyâ€”oh, Jesus, exactlyâ€”the same attitude of insouciant confidence that the other MacKenzie carried. â€œAbout a week past, abducted by a man named Cameron. Robert Cameron. Will ye maybe ken such a man?â€

Dougal of course did notâ€”not surprising, as Cameron hadnâ€™t existed here until a week ago. But he conferred with his men, asked intelligent questions, and expressed an open sympathy and concern that at once comforted Roger and made him feel as though he was about to vomit.

To this point, Dougal MacKenzie had been no more than a name on the historical page, momentarily, if vividly, illustrated by Claireâ€™s disjunct memories. Now he sat solid in the early-morning sun beside Roger on the bench outside the MacLarensâ€™ cottage, his plaid rough and smelling faintly of piss and heather, two daysâ€™ stubble rasping as he scratched his jaw in thought.

I like him, God help me. And, God help me, I know whatâ€™s going to happen to him. . . .

His eyes fixed in helpless fascination on the hollow of Dougalâ€™s throat, sun-brown and strong, framed in the open collar of his crumpled shirt. Roger jerked his eyes away, glancing instead at the russet hairs on Dougalâ€™s wrist, these catching the sunlight as he motioned toward the east, talking of his brother, chieftain of the clan MacKenzie.



â€œColum doesna travel, himself, but heâ€™d be glad to welcome the two of ye, should you find yourselves near Leoch in your search.â€ He smiled at Roger, who smiled back, warmed by it. â€œWhere dâ€™ye mean to go now?â€

Roger took a deep breath. Where, indeed?

â€œSouth, I think. William found no trace of Cameron in Inverness, so Iâ€™m thinking that he might be headed toward Edinburgh, meaning to take ship there.â€

Dougal pursed his lips, nodding in thought.

â€œWell, then.â€ He turned to his men, who had sat down on the rocks that lined the path, and called to them. â€œGeordie, Thomasâ€”weâ€™ll lend your beasts to these men; get your bags. Yeâ€™d have little chance of catching up to the villain on foot,â€ he said, turning back to Roger. â€œHe must be mounted himself, and moving fast, or yeâ€™d have found some trace of him.â€

â€œIâ€”thank you,â€ Roger managed. He felt a deep chill, in spite of the sun on his face. â€œYou mustâ€”I meanâ€”thatâ€™s very kind. Weâ€™ll bring them back as soon as we canâ€”or send them, ifâ€”if we should be detained anywhere.â€

â€œMoran taing,â€ Buck murmured, nodding to Geordie and Thomas, who nodded back, looking dour but philosophical at the prospect of walking back to wherever theyâ€™d come from.

Where have they come from? Apparently, Angus MacLaren had sent his son off last night before supper, to summon Dougal to come and have a look at his alarming guests. But Dougal and his men had to have been somewhere close at hand . . .

The chink of metal as Jock dumped an obviously heavy bag on the ground beside Dougal gave him a clue. Quarter Day. Dougal was collecting the rents for his brotherâ€”and likely on his way back to Leoch. A lot of the rents would have been paid in kindâ€”hams, chickens, wool, salt fishâ€”probably Dougalâ€™s party was accompanied by one or more wagons, which theyâ€™d left behind wherever theyâ€™d stayed last night.

Angus MacLaren and his oldest son stood a little to the side, eyes fixed suspiciously on Roger as though he might sprout wings and fly away. Dougal turned to Angus with a smile and said in GÃ idhlig, â€œDonâ€™t trouble, friend; theyâ€™re nay more ghosts than the lads and I are.â€

â€œDo not forget to entertain strangers,â€ Buck said in the same language, â€œfor thereby some have entertained angels unawares.â€

There was a startled pause at that, everyone staring at him. Then Dougal laughed, and his men followed him. Angus merely made a polite noise in his throat but shifted his weight and visibly relaxed. As though this had been a signalâ€”and perhaps it wasâ€”the door opened, and Mrs. MacLaren and Allie came out, with a stack of wooden bowls and a steaming pot of parritch. One of the smaller MacLarens came after, carefully bearing a saltcellar in both hands.

In the general hubbub of serving and eatingâ€”the women had oversalted his porridge, though not badlyâ€”Roger said quietly to Dougal, â€œDid MacLaren actually send to have you come and see whether I was a ghost?â€

Dougal looked surprised but then smiled, one side of his mouth turning up. It was the way Brianna smiled when she wanted to acknowledge a joke she didnâ€™t think was funnyâ€”or when she saw something funny that she didnâ€™t mean to share with the company. A searing pang followed the jolt of recognition, and Roger was obliged to look down for a moment and clear his throat in order to get control of his voice.

â€œNo, man,â€ Dougal said casually, also looking down as he wiped his bowl with a bit of hard journeycake taken from his saddlebag. â€œHe thought I might be of help to ye in your search.â€ He looked up then, straight at Rogerâ€™s neck, and raised one dark, heavy brow. â€œNot that the presence of a half-hangit man at your door doesna raise questions, ken?â€

â€œAt least a half-hangit man can answer the questions,â€ Buck put in. â€œNot like him from the croft above, aye?â€

That startled Dougal, who put down his spoon and stared at Buck. Who stared back, one fair brow raised.

Holy Lord . . . do they see it? Either of them? It wasnâ€™t warm, despite the sun, but Roger felt sweat begin to trickle down his spine. It was more a matter of posture and expression than of featureâ€”and yet the echo of similarity between the two faces was plain as the . . . well, as the long, straight nose on both faces.

Roger could see the thoughts flickering across Dougalâ€™s face: surprise, curiosity, suspicion.

â€œAnd what have ye to do with him above?â€ he asked, with a slight lift of his chin in the direction of the burnt-out croft.

â€œNot a thing, so far as I ken,â€ Buck answered, with a brief shrug. â€œOnly meaning as how if ye want to know what happened to my kinsman, ye can ask him. Weâ€™ve nothing to hide.â€

Thanks a lot, Roger thought, with a sideways look at his ancestor, who smiled blandly back at him and resumed gingerly eating his salty parritch. Why the bloody hell did you say that, of all things?

â€œI was hanged in mistake for another man,â€ he said, as casually as possible, but he heard the voice grate in his throat, tightening, and had to stop to clear it. â€œIn America.â€

â€œAmerica,â€ Dougal repeated, in open astonishment. All of them were staring at him now, men-at-arms and MacLarens both. â€œWhat took ye to Americaâ€”and what brought ye back, come to that?â€

â€œMy wife has kin there,â€ Roger replied, wondering what the devil Buck was up to. â€œIn North Carolina, on the Cape Fear River.â€ He very nearly named Hector and Jocasta Cameron, before remembering that Jocasta was Dougalâ€™s sister. Also that it was Culloden that had sent them to Americaâ€”and Culloden hadnâ€™t happened yet.

And he wonâ€™t live to see it, he thought, watching Dougalâ€™s face as he spoke, feeling a state of bemused horror. Dougal would die, hours before the battle, in the attics of Culloden House near Inverness, with Jamie Fraserâ€™s dirk sunk in the hollow of his throat.

He told the story of his hanging and rescue briefly, leaving out the context of the War of the Regulationâ€”and leaving out Buckâ€™s role in getting him hanged, too. He could feel Buck there beside him, leaning forward, intent, but didnâ€™t look at him. Couldnâ€™t look at him without wanting to strangle him. Wanted to strangle him anyway.

He could barely speak by the time he finished, and his heart was thumping in his ears with suppressed rage. Everyone was looking at him, with a range of emotions from awe to sympathy. Allie MacLaren was openly sniffing, her apron hem at her nose, and even her mother looked as though she somewhat regretted the salt. Angus coughed and handed him a stone bottle of what turned out to be beer, and a very grateful beverage it was, too. He muttered thanks and gulped it, avoiding all eyes.

Dougal nodded soberly, then turned to Angus.

â€œTell me about the man above,â€ he said. â€œWhen did that happenâ€”and what dâ€™ye ken about it?â€

MacLarenâ€™s face lost a little of its natural high color, and he looked as though he wanted his beer back.

â€œSix days past, a ghoistidh.â€ He gave a brief, and much less atmospheric, account than he had the night beforeâ€”but it was the same story.

Dougal looked thoughtful, tapping his fingers gently on his knee.

â€œThe woman,â€ he said. â€œDâ€™ye ken where sheâ€™s gone?â€

â€œI . . . uh . . . heard as how sheâ€™d gone to Cranesmuir, sir.â€ MacLarenâ€™s color had all come back, with interest, and he carefully avoided his wifeâ€™s hard eye.

â€œCranesmuir,â€ Dougal repeated. â€œAye, well. Perhaps Iâ€™ll seek her out, then, and just have a word. Whatâ€™s her name?â€

â€œIsbister,â€ MacLaren blurted. â€œGeillis Isbister.â€

Roger didnâ€™t actually feel the earth shake under his feet but was surprised that it hadnâ€™t.

â€œIsbister?â€ Dougalâ€™s brows went up. â€œFrom the northern isles, is she?â€

MacLaren shrugged in elaborate pantomime of ignoranceâ€”and unconcern. He looked as though someone had made a serious attempt to boil his head, and Roger saw Dougalâ€™s mouth twitch again.

â€œAye,â€ he said dryly. â€œWell, an Orkneywoman maybe wonâ€™t be hard to find, then, in a place the size of Cranesmuir.â€ He lifted his chin in the direction of his men, and they all rose as one when he stood. So did Roger and Buck.

â€œGodspeed to ye, gentlemen,â€ he said, bowing to them. â€œIâ€™ll have word put about regarding your wee lad. If I hear anything, where shall I send?â€

Roger exchanged glances with Buck, nonplussed. He couldnâ€™t ask for word to be sent to Lallybroch, knowing what he knew of the relations between Brian Fraser and his brothers-in-law.

â€œDo ye ken a place called Sheriffmuir?â€ he asked, groping for some other place he knew that existed at the present time. â€œThereâ€™s a fine coaching inn thereâ€”though not much else.â€

Dougal looked surprised but nodded.

â€œI do, sir. I fought at Sheriffmuir with the Earl of Mar, and we supped there with him one night, my father and brother and I. Aye, Iâ€™ll send word there, if there is any.â€

â€œThank you.â€ The words came half choked but clear enough. Dougal gave him a sympathetic nod, then turned to take leave of the MacLarens. Stopped by a sudden thought, though, he turned back.

â€œI dinna suppose ye really are an angel, are ye?â€ he asked, quite seriously.

â€œNo,â€ Roger said, smiling as best he could, despite the coldness in his belly. And it isnâ€™t you thatâ€™s talking to a ghost.

He stood with Buck, watching the MacKenzies depart, Geordie and Thomas keeping up with little effort, as the horses went slowly on the steep, rocky path.

The phrase â€œBlessed are those who have not seen but have believedâ€ floated through his head. It was maybe not the believing that was the blessing; it was the not having to look. Seeing, sometimes, was bloody awful.



ROGER DELAYED their own departure as long as he decently could, hoping for the return of Dr. McEwan, but as the sun rose high in the sky, it was plain that the MacLarens wanted them goneâ€”and Buck wanted to go.

â€œIâ€™m fine,â€ he said crossly, and thumped his chest with a fist. â€œSound as a drum.â€

Roger made a skeptical noise in his throatâ€”and was surprised. It hadnâ€™t hurt. He stopped himself putting a hand to his own throat; no need to draw attention to it, even if they were leaving.

â€œAye, all right.â€ He turned to Angus MacLaren and Stuart, whoâ€™d helpfully filled Rogerâ€™s canteen in the hope of hurrying them on their way and was standing with it dripping in his hands. â€œI thank ye for your hospitality, sir, and your kindness to my kinsman.â€

â€œOch,â€ said MacLaren, a distinct look of relief coming over his face at what was plainly farewell. â€œThatâ€™s fine. Nay bother.â€

â€œIfâ€”if the healer should come along, would ye thank him for us? And say Iâ€™ll try to come and see him on our way back.â€

â€œOn your way back,â€ MacLaren repeated, with less enthusiasm.

â€œAye. Weâ€™re bound into Lochaber, to the Cameron lands. If we find nay trace of my son there, though, weâ€™ll likely come back this wayâ€”perhaps weâ€™ll call at Castle Leoch for news.â€

MacLarenâ€™s face cleared at that.

â€œOch, aye,â€ he said heartily. â€œGood thought. Godspeed!â€





IN WHICH THINGS CONVERGE

â€œNOW, ITâ€™S NOT that I dinna want to be helping your mam,â€ Mr. Buchan said, for the third time. â€œBut I canna be having ructions going on in my house, and criminals coming and goin,â€™ not with my girls there, now, can I?â€



Jem shook his head obediently, though Mr. Buchan wasnâ€™t looking at him; he was peering into his rearview mirror and looking over his shoulder now and then, like he thought somebody might be following them. It made Jem want to look, too, but he couldnâ€™t see behind without getting up on his knees and turning round, and Mandy was passed out asleep, half on his lap.

It was late, and he yawned, forgetting to cover his mouth. He thought of saying, â€œExcuse me,â€ but he didnâ€™t think Mr. Buchan had noticed. He felt a burp coming and did cover his mouth this time, tasting vinegar from the fish and chips. Mr. Buchan had bought an extra fish supper for Mam; it was in a brown-paper bag on the floor by Jemâ€™s feet, so as not to get grease on the seat.

â€œKen when your daâ€™s expected back?â€ Mr. Buchan asked abruptly, glancing down at him. Jem shook his head, feeling the fish and chips rise up in a queasy ball.

Mr. Buchanâ€™s mouth pressed tight, like he wanted to say something he thought he shouldnâ€™t.

â€œDaddy . . .â€ Mandy murmured, then pushed her head into his ribs, snorted, and went back to sleep. He felt terrible. Mandy didnâ€™t even know where Da was; she probably thought he was just at lodge or something.

Mam said Da would come back, as soon as he figured out that Jem wasnâ€™t there with Grandda. But how? he thought, and had to bite his lip hard not to cry. How would he know? It was dark, but there was a glow from the dashboard. If he cried, Mr. Buchan would maybe see.

Headlights flashed in the rearview mirror and he looked up, brushing his sleeve furtively under his nose. He could see a white panel truck coming up behind them. Mr. Buchan said something under his breath and stepped on the gas pedal harder.



BRIANNA HAD SETTLED into the hunterâ€™s wait: a state of physical detachment and mental abeyance, mind and body each minding its own business but able to spring into unified action the moment something worth eating showed up. Her mind was on the Ridge, reliving a possum hunt with her cousin Ian. The pungent stickiness and eye-watering smoke of pine-knot torches, a glimpse of glowing eyes in a tree, and a sudden bristling possum like a nightmare in the branches, needle-toothed and gaping threats, hissing and growling like a flatulent motorboat . . .

And then the phone rang. In an instant she was standing, gun in hand, every sense trained on the house. It came again, the short double brr! muffled by distance but unmistakable. It was the phone in Rogerâ€™s study, and even as she thought this, she saw the brief glow of a light inside as the study door was opened, and the ringing phone abruptly stopped.

Her scalp contracted, and she felt a brief kinship with the treed possum. But the possum hadnâ€™t had a shotgun.

Her immediate impulse was to go and flush out whoever was in her house and demand to know the meaning of this. Her money was on Rob Cameron, and the thought of flushing him like a grouse and marching him out at the point of a gun made her hand tighten on said gun with anticipation. She had Jem back; Cameron would know she didnâ€™t need to keep him alive.

But. She hesitated in the door of the broch, looking down.

But whoever was in the house had answered the phone. If I was a burglar, I wouldnâ€™t be answering the phone in the house I was burgling. Not unless I thought it would wake up the people inside.

Whoever was in her house already knew no one was home.

â€œQuod erat demonstrandum,â€ her fatherâ€™s voice said in her mind, with a grim satisfaction. Someone in the house was expecting a call.

She stepped outside, with a deep breath of the fresh cold scent of gorse replacing the dank musk of the broch, her heart beating fast and her mind working faster. Who would be calling himâ€”them? To say what?

Maybe someone had been watching earlier, seen her coming down the forestry road. Maybe they were calling to tell Rob she was outside, in the broch. No, that didnâ€™t make sense. Whoever was in the house, theyâ€™d been in there when she arrived. If someone had seen her come, theyâ€™d have called the house then.

â€œIta sequitur . . .â€ she murmured. Thus it follows: if the call wasnâ€™t about her, it must be either a warning that someoneâ€”the police, and why?â€”was coming toward Lallybrochâ€”or news that whoever was on the outside had found the kids.

The metal of the barrel was slick under her sweating palm, and it took a noticeable effort to keep a firm grip on the gun. Even more of an effort not to run toward the house.

Aggravating as it was, she had to wait. If someone had found the kids, she couldnâ€™t reach Fionaâ€™s house in time to protect them; sheâ€™d have to depend on Fiona and Ernie and the City of Inverness police. But if that was the case, whoever was in the house would surely be coming out right away. Unless that bastard Rob means to hang around in hopes of catching me unawares, and . . . Despite the gun in her hand, that thought gave her an unpleasant squirm deep insideâ€”one she recognized as the ghostly touch of Stephen Bonnetâ€™s penis.

â€œI killed you, Stephen,â€ she said under her breath. â€œAnd Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re dead. You may have company in hell pretty soon. Make sure the fireâ€™s lit for him, okay?â€

That restored her nerve, and dropping to her haunches, she duckwalked through the gorse, coming down the hillside at an angle that would bring her out near the kailyard, not by the path, which was visible from the house. Even in the dark, she was taking no chances; there was a rising half-moon, though it showed erratically through scudding cloud.

The sound of a car coming made her lift her head, peering over a tuft of dry broom. She put a hand in her pocket, thumbing through the loose shotgun shells. Fourteen. That should be enough.

Fionaâ€™s remark about ballistics flitted through her mind, along with a faint reminder of the possibility of going to prison for wholesale manslaughter. She might risk it, for the satisfaction of killing Rob Cameronâ€”but the unwelcome thought occurred to her that while she didnâ€™t need him to locate Jem anymore, she did need to find out what the hell was going on. And while the police might track down the man from the dam, if there was some sort of gang involved, Rob was likely the only way of finding out who the others wereâ€”and what they wanted.

The headlights jounced down the lane and into the dooryard, and she stood up abruptly. The motion-detecting light had come on, showing her Ernieâ€™s white panel truck, unmistakable, with BUCHAN ELECTRICS/FOR ALL YOUR CURRENT NEEDS, CALL 01463 775 4432 on the side, with a drawing of a severed cable, spitting sparks.

â€œBloody hell,â€ she said. â€œBloody, bloody hell!â€

The truckâ€™s door opened and Jem tumbled out, then turned round to help Mandy, who was no more than a short dark blot in the recesses of the truck.

â€œGET BACK IN THE TRUCK!â€ Brianna bellowed, leaping down the slope, skittering on rolling stones and bending her ankles in spongy patches of heather. â€œJEMMY! GET BACK!â€

She saw Jem turn, his face white in the glare of the light, but it was too late. The front door flew open and two dark figures rushed out, running for the truck.

She wasted no more breath but ran for all she was worth. A shotgun was useless at any distanceâ€”or maybe not. She skidded to a halt, shouldered the gun, and fired. Buckshot flew into the gorse with a whizzing sound like tiny arrows, but the bang had halted the intruders in their tracks.

â€œBACK IN THE TRUCK!â€ she roared, and fired again. The intruders galloped toward the house, and Jem, bless his heart, leapt into the truck like a startled frog and slammed the door. Ernie, who had just got out, stood for a moment gawking up the slope, but then, realizing what had happened, came suddenly to life and dived for his own door.

She reloaded in the glow of the spotlight. How long would the light stay on with no one moving in its range? She racked a fresh shell and ran for Ernieâ€™s truck. More headlights jerked her attention toward the lane. Holy Mary, Mother of God, who was this? Please, God, let it be the police . . .

The light winked out, then on again almost at once, as the second vehicle roared into the dooryard, moving fast. The people inside the house were hanging out of the drawing room casement, yelling something at the new truckâ€”yes, it was another panel truck, much like Ernieâ€™s, save that it said POULTNEYâ€™S, PURVEYOR OF FINE GAME and had a picture of a wild boar.

â€œHoly Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . . .â€ She had to get to Ernieâ€™s truck beforeâ€”too late. The FINE GAME truck revved up and rammed Ernieâ€™s truck in the side, shunting it several yards. She could hear Mandyâ€™s scream above everything, sharp as an augur through her heart.

â€œBloody Mother of . . . Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!â€ She couldnâ€™t take time to circle the dooryard. She ran straight across it, took close aim, and shredded the front tire of the FINE GAME truck with a blast of buckshot.

â€œSTAY IN THE TRUCK!â€ she shouted, chambering the second shell and pointing the gun at the windshield in the same motion. A blur of white as at least two people ducked down out of sight below the dash.

The menâ€”yes, both menâ€”inside the house were yelling at each other, and at the people in the truck, and at her. Useless adjurations and insults, mostly, but one of them was now pointing out to the others that her weapon was a shotgun. Useless except at short range, and only two shots.

â€œYou canâ€™t cover us all, hen!â€

That was Rob Cameron, shouting from the Poultneyâ€™s truck. She didnâ€™t bother replying but ran to get in range of the house, and the drawing room window dissolved in a shower of glass.

Sweat was running down her sides, tickling. She broke the gun and thumbed two more shells into place. She felt as though she were moving in slow motionâ€”but the rest of the world was moving slower. With no sense of hurry, she walked to Ernieâ€™s truck and put her back against the door behind which Jem and Mandy were sheltering. A strong waft of fish and malt vinegar floated out as the window cranked down a few inches.

â€œMamâ€”â€

â€œMummy! Mummy!â€

â€œBloody hell, Brianna! Whatâ€™s going on?â€

â€œA bunch of nutters are trying to kill me and take my kids, Ernie,â€ she said, raising her voice over Mandyâ€™s wailing. â€œWhat does it look like? How about you start the engine, hmm?â€

The other truck was out of effective shotgun range from here, and she could see only one side of it. She heard its door open on the other side and saw a flicker of movement inside the shattered window of the house.

â€œNow would be a good time, Ernie.â€ She wasnâ€™t forgetting that one of the bastards had her rifle. She could only hope they didnâ€™t know how to use it.

Ernie was frantically turning the key and stomping the gas. She could hear him praying under his breath, but heâ€™d flooded the engine; the starter whirred uselessly. Lower lip tucked under her teeth, she strode round the front of the truck in time to catch one of the people from the FINE GAME truckâ€”to her surprise, this one was a woman, a short, dumpy shape in a balaclava and an old Barbour. She raised the shotgun to her shoulder, and the woman tried to run backward, tripped, and fell on her backside with an audible â€œOof!â€

She wanted to laugh but then saw Cameron climbing out of the truck, her rifle in hand, and the urge left her.

â€œDrop it!â€ She strode toward him, gun at her shoulder. He didnâ€™t know how to use the rifle; he glanced wildly from her to the gun, as though hoping it would aim itself, then changed his mind and dropped it.

The front door of the house slammed open, and she heard running feet coming fast. She whirled on her heel and ran, too, reaching Ernieâ€™s truck barely in time to hold off the two men from the house. One immediately began to sidle round, clearly meaning to circle the other truck and collect his idiot comrades. Rob Cameron was now advancing on her slowly, hands held up to show his non-offensiveâ€”haâ€”intent.

â€œLook, Brianna, we donâ€™t mean ye any harm,â€ he said.

She racked a fresh shell in answer to that, and he took a step back.

â€œI mean it,â€ he said, an edge in his voice. â€œWe want to talk to you, is all.â€

â€œAye, pull the other one,â€ she said, â€œitâ€™s got bells on. Ernie?â€

â€œMamâ€”â€

â€œDonâ€™t you dare open that door until I say so, Jemmy!â€



â€œMam!â€

â€œGet down on the floor, Jem, right now! Take Mandy!â€ One of the men from the house and the dumpy woman were moving again; she could hear them. And the second man from the house had disappeared into the dark outside the circle of light. â€œERNIE!â€

â€œBut, Mam, somebodyâ€™s coming!â€

Everyone froze for an instant, and the sound of an engine advancing down the farm track came clearly through the night. She turned and grabbed the door handle, jerking it open just as Ernieâ€™s engine finally coughed into full-throated life. She hurled herself into the seat, her feet narrowly missing Jemâ€™s head as he peered up from the footwell, eyes huge in the dim light.

â€œLetâ€™s go, Ernie,â€ she said, very calmly under the circumstance. â€œKids, you stay down there.â€

A rifle butt struck the window near Ernieâ€™s head, starring the glass, and he yelped but didnâ€™t, God bless him, flood the engine again. Another blow and the glass broke in a cascade of glittering fragments. Brianna dropped her own gun and lunged across Ernie, reaching for the rifle. She got a hand on it, but the man holding it wrenched it free. Grabbing wildly, she scrabbled at the balaclavaâ€™d shape, and the woolly helmet came off in her hand, leaving the man beneath openmouthed with shock.

The spotlight went off, plunging the yard into darkness, and bright spots danced in front of her eyes. It popped back on again as the new vehicle roared into the yard, horn blaring. Brianna lifted herself out of Ernieâ€™s lap, trying to see out through the windshield, then flung herself toward the other side of the truck.

It was an ordinary car, a dark-blue Fiat, looking like a toy as it circled the yard, horn blatting like a sow in heat.

â€œFriend, dâ€™ye think?â€ Ernie asked, his voice strained but not panicked. â€œOr foe?â€

â€œFriend,â€ she said, breathless, as the Fiat charged three of the intruders who were standing together: the unmasked rifle-wielder, the woman in the Barbour jacket, and whoever the guy who wasnâ€™t Rob Cameron was. They scattered like cockroaches into the grass, and Ernie slammed a fist on the dash in exultation.

â€œThatâ€™ll show the buggers!â€

Bree would have liked to stay and watch the rest of the show, but wherever Cameron was, he was undoubtedly too close.

â€œGo, Ernie!â€

He went, with a terrible crunching and screeching of metal. The van lurched badly; the back axle must be damaged. She could only hope a wheel didnâ€™t come off.

The blue Fiat was prowling the dooryard; it honked and flashed its lights at Ernieâ€™s truck, and a hand waved from the driverâ€™s window. Brianna stuck her head out cautiously and returned the wave, then dropped back into her seat, panting. Black spots were swimming in her field of vision and her hair stuck to her face, lank with sweat.

They limped down the lane in first gear, with a horrible grinding noise; from the sound of it, the back wheel well had caved in.



â€œMam.â€ Jemmy stuck his head up over the edge of the seat like a prairie dog. â€œCan I come up now?â€

â€œSure.â€ She took a deep breath and helped Mandy scramble up after him. The little girl plastered herself at once to Briannaâ€™s chest, whimpering.

â€œItâ€™s okay, baby,â€ she whispered into Mandyâ€™s hair, clinging to the solid small body as much as Mandy clung to her. â€œEverything will be fine.â€ She glanced down at Jem, riding between Ernie and herself. He was hunched into himself and shivering visibly in his checked wool jacket, even though it was warm in the cab. She reached out a hand and took him by the back of the neck, shaking him gently. â€œOkay there, pal?â€

He nodded, but without saying anything. She folded her hand over his, clenched into a small fist on his knee, and held it tightâ€”both in reassurance and to stop her own hand shaking.

Ernie cleared his throat.

â€œIâ€™m sorry, Brianna,â€ he said gruffly. â€œI didna ken thatâ€”I mean, I thought it would be okay to bring the bairns back, and after yon Cameron came to the house and hit Fiona, Iâ€”â€ A trickle of sweat gleamed as it ran down behind his ear.

â€œHe what?â€ After the events of the last hour, this news registered only as a blip on her personal seismograph, obscured by the bigger shock waves that were only now dying down. But she asked questions, and Jem began to come out of his own shell shock, telling about his part, gradually becoming indignant about Mrs. Kelleher and the police dispatcher. She felt a quiver in the pit of her stomach that wasnâ€™t quite laughter but close enough.

â€œDonâ€™t worry about it, Ernie.â€ She brushed off his renewed attempts at apology. Her voice rasped, her throat sore from shouting. â€œIâ€™d have done the same, I expect. And weâ€™d never have got away without you.â€ Theyâ€™d never have been there without him in the first place, but he knew that as well as she did; no point in rubbing it in.

â€œAye, mmphm.â€ He drove in silence for a moment, then remarked conversationally, looking in the rearview mirror, â€œYon wee blue motorâ€™s following us, ken.â€ His throat moved as he swallowed.

Brianna rubbed a hand over her face, then looked. Sure enough, the Fiat was trundling after them at a discreet distance.

Ernie coughed. â€œEhm . . . where dâ€™ye want to go, Bree? Only, Iâ€™m none sae sure weâ€™ll make it all the way into the town. But thereâ€™s a petrol station with a garridge bay on the main roadâ€”if I was to stop there, theyâ€™d have a phone. Ye could call the polis while I deal wiâ€™ the van.â€

â€œDonâ€™t call the polis, Mam,â€ Jemmy said, his nostrils flaring with disgust. â€œTheyâ€™re no help.â€

â€œMmphm,â€ she said noncommittally, and raised an eyebrow at Ernie, who nodded and set his jaw.

She was inclined against calling the police herselfâ€”but out of concern lest they be too inquisitively helpful. Sheâ€™d managed to deflect them from the touchy question of just where her husband was last night, telling them he was in London to visit the British Museum Reading Room and that sheâ€™d call him as soon as they got home. If the police found out about the shoot-out at the O.K. Corral, there was going to be a lot more scrutiny of her private affairs. And it took no stretch of imagination at all to conclude that the police might really suspect her of having something to do with Rogerâ€™s disappearance, since she couldnâ€™t produce him and couldnâ€™t tell them where he was. Might never be able to. She swallowed, hard.

The only recourse would be to claim that theyâ€™d had a fight and heâ€™d walked out on herâ€”but that would sound pretty flimsy, in light of recent events. And she wouldnâ€™t say something like that in front of the kids, regardless.

But stopping at the petrol station was the only thing she could see to do at the moment. If the blue Fiat followed them there, at least she might discover an ally. And if it was the police, incognito . . . well, sheâ€™d cross that bridge when she came to it. Adrenaline and shock had both left her now; she felt detached, dreamy, and very, very tired. Jemmyâ€™s hand had relaxed in hers, but his fingers were still curled around her thumb.

She leaned back, closing her eyes, and slowly traced the curve of Mandyâ€™s spine with her free hand. Her little girl had relaxed into sleep against her chest, her son with his head on her shoulder, the weight of her childrenâ€™s trust heavy on her heart.



THE PETROL STATION was next to a Little Chef cafÃ©. She left Ernie to talk to the garageman while she extracted the kids. She didnâ€™t bother looking over her shoulder; the blue Fiat had fallen back to a respectful distance, not crowding them as they crawled clanking and grinding down the motorway at 20 mph. If the driver didnâ€™t mean to talk to her, heâ€™d have driven off and disappeared. Maybe sheâ€™d manage a cup of tea before she had to deal with him.

â€œCanâ€™t wait,â€ she muttered. â€œGet the door, please, Jem?â€

Mandy was inert as a bag of cement in her arms but began to stir at the smell of food. Bree gagged at the reek of stale frying oil, burnt chips, and synthetic pancake syrup, but ordered ice cream for Jem and Mandy, with a cup of tea for herself. Surely even this place couldnâ€™t ruin tea?

A cup of barely warm water and a PG Tips tea bag convinced her otherwise. It didnâ€™t matter; her throat was so tight that she doubted she could swallow even water.

The blessed numbness of shock was lifting, much as she would have preferred to keep it wrapped blanket-like around her. The cafÃ© seemed too bright, with acres of foot-marked white lino; she felt exposed, like a bug on a grimy kitchen floor. Prickles of apprehension sparked unpleasantly over her scalp, and she kept her eyes fixed on the door, wishing sheâ€™d been able to bring the shotgun inside.

She didnâ€™t realize that Jem had also been watching the door until he stiffened to attention beside her in the booth.

â€œMam! Itâ€™s Mr. Menzies!â€

For a moment, neither the words nor the sight of the man who had just entered the cafÃ© made any sense. She blinked several times, but he was still there, striding toward them with an anxious face. Jemâ€™s school principal.



â€œMrs. MacKenzie,â€ he said, and, reaching across the table, shook her hand fervently. â€œThank God youâ€™re all right!â€

â€œEr . . . thanks,â€ she said feebly. â€œYouâ€”was that you? In the blue Fiat?â€ It was like being keyed up to confront Darth Vader and coming face-to-face with Mickey Mouse.

He actually blushed behind his glasses.

â€œEhm . . . well, aye. Iâ€”er . . .â€ He caught Jemâ€™s eye and smiled awkwardly. â€œYouâ€™re taking good care of your mother, then, Jem?â€

â€œAye, sir.â€ Jem was quite obviously about to burst with questions. Bree forestalled him with a quelling look and gestured to Lionel Menzies to sit down. He did and took a deep breath, about to say something, but was interrupted by the waitress, a solid, middle-aged woman with thick stockings and a cardigan and an air that indicated that she didnâ€™t care whether they were space aliens or cockroaches, so long as they didnâ€™t complicate her life.

â€œDonâ€™t order the tea,â€ Bree said, with a nod toward her cup.

â€œAye, thanks. Iâ€™ll have . . . a bacon butty and an Irn-Bru?â€ he asked tentatively, looking up at the waitress. â€œWith tomato sauce?â€ She scorned to reply but flipped her pad shut and trundled off.

â€œRight,â€ Menzies said, squaring his shoulders like one about to face a firing squad. â€œTell me the one thing, would you? Was it Rob Cameron there at your house?â€

â€œIt was.â€ Bree spoke tersely, recalling belatedly that Cameron was related to Menzies in some wayâ€”a cousin or something? â€œWhy?â€

He looked unhappy. A pale-faced man with slightly receding curly brown hair and glasses, he wasnâ€™t remarkable in any way and yet usually had a presence, a friendliness and quiet air of authority about him that drew the eye and made one feel reassured in his company. This was notably lacking tonight.

â€œI was afraid that it might be. I heardâ€”on the evening news. That Rob was being looked for by the policeâ€â€”he lowered his voice, though there was no one within earshotâ€”â€œin connection with . . . well, withâ€â€”he nodded discreetly toward Jemâ€”â€œtaking Jeremiah, here.â€

â€œHe did!â€ Jem said, dropping his spoon and sitting up straight. â€œHe did, Mr. Menzies! He said he was going to take me to spend the night with Bobby, only he didnâ€™t, he took me up to the rocks andâ€”â€

â€œJem.â€ Brianna spoke quietly, but it was her Shut Up Right Now voice, and he did, though with an audible snort and a glare at her.

â€œYes, he did,â€ she said levelly. â€œWhat do you know about it?â€

He blinked in surprise.

â€œIâ€”why, nothing. I canâ€™t imagine why heâ€”â€ He broke off, coughed, and taking his glasses off, pulled a pocket handkerchief out and polished them. By the time he put them back on, heâ€™d pulled himself together.

â€œYou may remember, Rob Cameronâ€™s my cousin. And heâ€™s in lodge, of course. I was knocked off my perch to hear this about him. So I thought Iâ€™d maybe come out to Lallybroch, have a word with you and your husbandâ€â€”he lifted an eyebrow, but she didnâ€™t respond to this obvious hint about Roger, and he went onâ€”â€œsee that Jem was all rightâ€”are ye all right, Jem?â€ he broke off to ask seriously, glancing at the boy.



â€œOh, aye, fine,â€ Jem replied airily, though he seemed tense. â€œSir,â€ he added belatedly, and licked a smear of chocolate ice cream off his upper lip.

â€œThatâ€™s good.â€ Menzies smiled at Jem, and Brianna saw a little of his usual warmth light up behind the glasses. The warmth was still in his eyes, though he was serious when he looked at her. â€œI wanted to ask if thereâ€™d maybe been a mistake, but Iâ€™m thinking that there likely wasnâ€™t? In light of . . . all that.â€ He tilted his head in the direction of Lallybroch and swallowed.

â€œYes, there was,â€ she said grimly, shifting Mandyâ€™s weight on her lap, â€œand Rob Cameron made it.â€

He grimaced, drew a deep breath, but nodded.

â€œIâ€™d like to help,â€ he said simply.

â€œYou definitely did,â€ she assured him, wondering what on earth to do with him now. â€œIck! Mandy, youâ€™re dribbling all over everywhere! Use a napkin, for heavenâ€™s sake.â€ She swabbed Mandyâ€™s face briskly, ignoring her daughterâ€™s cranky whine. Could he help? She wanted badly to believe him; she was still shaking internally and all too ready to grab at any offer of assistance.

But he was Rob Cameronâ€™s relative. And maybe heâ€™d come out to the house to talk, and maybe heâ€™d come for some other reason. He might, after all, have intervened to keep her from blasting Rob into bloody shreds, rather than to save her and the kids from Rob and his masked sidekicks.

â€œI spoke to Ernie Buchan,â€ Menzies said, nodding toward the plate-glass window. â€œHe, um, seemed to think that you might not want the police involved?â€

â€œNo.â€ Breeâ€™s mouth was dry; she sipped the lukewarm tea, trying to think. It was getting harder by the moment; her thoughts scattered like drops of quicksilver, wobbling away in a dozen directions. â€œNotâ€”not just yet. We were at the police station half of last night. I really canâ€™t deal with any more questions tonight.â€ She took a deep breath and stared at him directly.

â€œI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on,â€ she said. â€œI donâ€™t know why Rob Cameron should have kidnapped Jemmyâ€”â€

â€œYes, you dâ€”â€ Jem started, and she whipped her head round and glared at him. He glared back, red-eyed and clench-fisted, and with a jolt of alarm she recognized the Fraser temper, about to go off with a bang.

â€œYou do so know!â€ he said, loudly enough that a couple of truckers at the counter turned round to look at him. â€œI told you! He wanted me toâ€”â€ Mandy, who had started to drop off again, jerked awake and started to wail.

â€œI want Daddeeeee!â€

Jemâ€™s face was bright red with fury. At this, it went white.

â€œShut up, shut up, shut up!â€ he shrieked at Mandy, who yelped in terror and screamed louder, trying to scramble up Briannaâ€™s body.

â€œDADDEEE!â€

â€œJem!â€ Lionel Menzies was on his feet, reaching for the boy, but Jem was absolutely beside himself, literally hopping up and down with rage. The entire restaurant was gaping at them.

â€œGo AWAY!â€ Jem roared at Menzies. â€œDAMMIT! Donâ€™t you touch me! Donâ€™t touch my mam!â€ And, in an excess of passion, he kicked Menzies hard on the shin.

â€œJesus!â€



â€œJem!â€ Bree had a grip on the struggling, bawling Mandy but couldnâ€™t reach Jem before he picked up his dish of ice cream, flung it at the wall, and then ran out of the cafÃ©, crashing the door open so hard that a man and woman on the verge of entering were forced to leap aside to avoid being knocked over as he rocketed past.

Brianna sat down quite suddenly, as all the blood left her head. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us . . .

The room was silent, save for Mandyâ€™s sobbing, though this was dying down as her panic subsided. She burrowed into Briannaâ€™s chest, burying her face in the padded coat.

â€œHush, sweetie,â€ Bree whispered, bending her head so that Mandyâ€™s curls brushed her lips. â€œHush, now. Itâ€™s all right. Everything will be all right.â€

A muffled mumble ended with a tearful â€œ. . . Daddy?â€

â€œYes,â€ Bree said firmly. â€œWeâ€™ll see Daddy soon.â€

Lionel Menzies cleared his throat. Heâ€™d sat down to massage his shin but left off doing this to gesture toward the door.

â€œHad I . . . better go after Jem?â€

â€œNo. Heâ€™s all right . . . I mean . . . heâ€™s with Ernie. I can see him.â€ They were in the parking lot, just visible in the glow of light from the neon sign. Jem had cannoned into Ernie, who was coming toward the restaurant, and was clinging to him like a limpet. As Brianna watched, Ernie, an experienced father, knelt down and hugged Jem to him, patting his back and smoothing his hair, talking earnestly to him.

â€œMmphm.â€ It was the waitress with Menzieâ€™s butty, her stolid face melted into sympathy. â€œThe wee lassieâ€™s tired, nay doubt.â€

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ Bree said feebly, and nodded at the shattered dish and splotch of chocolate ice cream on the wall. â€œIâ€™ll, um, pay for it.â€

â€œOch, dinna fash, lass,â€ the waitress said, shaking her head. â€œIâ€™ve had weans. I can see yeâ€™ve got enough trouble to be goinâ€™ on with. Let me fetch ye oot a nice cup oâ€™ tea.â€

She trundled off. Without speaking, Lionel Menzies popped the tab on his can of Irn-Bru and shoved it in her direction. She picked it up and gulped it. The advertising implied that the stuff was made from rusty iron girders salvaged from Glasgow shipyards. Only in Scotland would this have been considered a good selling point, she reflected. But it was about half sugar, and the glucose hit her bloodstream like the elixir of life.

Menzies nodded, seeing her straighten up like a wilting flower revived.

â€œWhere is Roger?â€ he asked softly.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ she said, just as softly; Mandy had given a final hiccuping sigh and fallen heavily asleep, face still buried in Briannaâ€™s coat. She twitched the quilted fabric aside so Mandy wouldnâ€™t suffocate. â€œAnd I donâ€™t know when heâ€™s coming back.â€

He grimaced, looking unhappy and strangely embarrassed; he was having trouble meeting her eyes.

â€œI see. Mmphm. Was itâ€”I mean, did he . . . leave because of what Rob . . . er . . . did to Jem?â€ His voice dropped even lower and she blinked at him. Rising blood sugar had brought her thoughts back into focus, though, and suddenly the penny dropped, and the blood rushed into her face.



He thought Rob had abducted Jemmy in order toâ€”and Jemmy had said, â€œYou know what he did,â€ and sheâ€™d shut him up sharp . . . and sheâ€™d said she didnâ€™t want the police involved . . . oh, dear Lord. She took a deep breath and rubbed a hand over her face, wondering whether it was better to let him think Rob had molested Jemmyâ€”and was now trying to murder her in order to cover that upâ€”or to tell him some halfway believable version of some part of the truth.

â€œRob came to my house last night and tried to rape me,â€ she said, leaning over Mandyâ€™s head in order to keep her voice low enough to escape the flapping ears of the truckers sitting at the counter, who were glancing covertly over their shoulders at her. â€œHeâ€™d already taken Jem, and Roger had left to try to find him. We thought heâ€™d taken Jem away to . . . to Orkney.â€ That seems far enough. â€œI . . . left messages; I expect Rogerâ€™ll be back any time nowâ€”as soon as he hears that Jemmyâ€™s been found.â€ She crossed her fingers under the table.

Menziesâ€™s face went blank, all his previous assumptions colliding with new ones.

â€œHeâ€”heâ€”oh.â€ He paused for a moment, mechanically took a swallow of her cold tea, and made a face. â€œYou mean,â€ he said carefully, â€œthat you think Rob took Jem in order to lure your husband away, so that he . . . ehm . . . couldâ€”â€

â€œYes, I do.â€ She seized on this suggestion gratefully.

â€œBut . . . those other people. With theâ€”â€ He passed a hand vaguely over his head, indicating the balaclavas. â€œWhat on earth . . . ?â€

â€œI have no idea,â€ she said firmly. She wasnâ€™t going to mention the Spanish gold unless or until she had to. The fewer people who knew about that, the better. And as for the other thing . . .

But the mention of â€œthose other peopleâ€ reminded her of something, and she groped in her capacious pocket, drawing out the balaclava that sheâ€™d snatched off the man whoâ€™d broken the window with the rifle. Sheâ€™d caught the barest glimpse of his face amidst the shifting light and shadow and had had no time to think about it. But now she did, and a fresh qualm went through her.

â€œDo you know a man named Michael Callahan?â€ she asked, trying to keep her voice casual. Menzies glanced at the balaclava, then at her, eyes widening.

â€œOf course I do. Heâ€™s an archaeologist, something to do with ORCAâ€”Orkney Research Centre, I mean. Orkney . . . Youâ€™re no telling me he was with the people whoâ€”â€

â€œPretty sure. I saw his face for just a second when I pulled this off him. Andâ€â€”she grimaced in distaste, plucking a tuft of sandy hair from the inside of the balaclavaâ€”â€œapparently thatâ€™s not all I pulled off him. Rob knows him. He came out to Lallybroch to give us an opinion on some ruins up behind the house, and stayed to supper.â€

â€œOh, dearie me,â€ Menzies murmured, seeming to sink back into his seat. He took off his glasses and massaged his forehead for a bit. She watched him think, feeling increasingly remote.

The waitress hove to and put down a fresh cup of hot, milky tea, already sugared and stirred. Brianna thanked her and sat sipping it, watching the night outside. Ernie had taken Jem off in the direction of the garage, doubtless to check on his van.

â€œI can see why you donâ€™t want trouble,â€ Menzies said carefully at last. Heâ€™d eaten half his butty; the rest of it lay on the plate, oozing ketchup in a queasy sort of way. â€œBut really, Mrs.â€”may I call you Brianna?â€

â€œBree,â€ she said. â€œSure.â€

â€œBree,â€ he said, nodding, and one corner of his mouth twitched.

â€œYes, I know what it means in Scots,â€ she said dryly, seeing the thought cross his face. A bree was a storm or a great disturbance.

Lionelâ€™s face broke into a half smile.

â€œYes. Well . . . what Iâ€™m thinking, Breeâ€”I hate to suggest it, but what if Robâ€™s done some harm to Roger? Would it not be worth the questions to get the police to look for him?â€

â€œHe hasnâ€™t.â€ She felt unutterably tired and wanted only to go home. â€œBelieve me, he hasnâ€™t. Roger went with hisâ€”his cousin, Buck. And if Rob had managed to hurt them somehow, heâ€™d certainly have gloated about that when he . . . well.â€ She took a breath that went all the way down to her aching feet and shifted her weight, getting a solid hold on Mandy.

â€œLionel. Tell you what. Drive us home, will you? If that lotâ€™s still lurking around, then weâ€™ll go to the police right away. If notâ€”it can wait â€™til the morning.â€

He didnâ€™t like it, but he was suffering from the aftereffects of shock and fatigue, too, and after more argument finally agreed, done in by her implacable stubbornness.

Ernie had telephoned for a ride, after being assured that Lionel would see them home. Lionel was tense on the way back to Lallybroch, hands white-knuckled on the steering wheel, but the Fiatâ€™s headlights showed the dooryard empty, save for a discarded tire lying in the gravel, shredded rubber spraying out like the wings of some gigantic vulture shot out of the sky.

Both the kids were sound asleep; Lionel carried Jem in, then insisted on searching the house with Bree, nailing up laths across the shattered window in the parlor while she combed the roomsâ€”againâ€”suffering dÃ©jÃ  vu.

â€œHad I not better spend the night?â€ Lionel asked, hesitating at the door. â€œIâ€™d be happy to sit up and keep watch, you know.â€

She smiled, though it took a lot of effort.

â€œYour wife will already be wondering where you are. No, youâ€™ve done enoughâ€”more than enough for us. Donâ€™t worry; Iâ€™ll . . . take steps in the morning. I just want the kids to be able to have a good nightâ€™s sleep in their own beds.â€

He nodded, lips drawn in in worry, and glanced round the foyer, its gleaming walnut paneling serene in the lamplight, even the English saber slashes somehow grown homely and peaceful with age.

â€œDo you maybe have familyâ€”friendsâ€”in America?â€ he asked abruptly. â€œI mean, it might not be a bad idea to get right away for a bit, aye?â€

â€œYes,â€ she said. â€œI was thinking that myself. Thanks, Lionel. Good night.â€





ALL MY LOVE

SHE WAS SHAKING. Had been shaking ever since Lionel Menzies left. With a faint sense of abstraction, she held out her hand, fingers spread, and watched it vibrate like a tuning fork. Then, irritated, made a fist and smacked it hard into the palm of her other hand. Smacked it again and again, clenching her teeth in fury, until she had to stop, gasping for breath, her palm tingling.

â€œOkay,â€ she said under her breath, teeth still clenched. â€œOkay.â€ The red haze had lifted like a cloud, leaving a pile of cold, icy little thoughts under it.

We have to go.

Where?

And when?

And the coldest of all:

What about Roger?

She was sitting in the study, the wood paneling glowing softly in the candlelight. There was a perfectly good reading lamp, as well as the ceiling fixture, but sheâ€™d lit the big candle instead. Roger liked to use that when he wrote late at night, writing down the songs and poems heâ€™d memorized, sometimes with a goose quill. He said it helped him recall the words, bringing back an echo of the time where heâ€™d learned them.

The candleâ€™s smell of hot wax brought back an echo of him. If she closed her eyes, she could hear him, humming low in his throat as he worked, stopping now and then to cough or clear his damaged throat. Her fingers rubbed softly over the wooden desk, summoning the touch of the rope scar on his throat, passing round to cup the back of his head, bury her fingers in the thick black warmth of his hair, bury her face in his chest . . .

She was shaking again, this time with silent sobs. She curled her fist again, but this time just breathed until it stopped.

â€œThis will not do,â€ she said out loud, sniffed deeply, and, clicking on the light, she blew out the candle and reached for a sheet of paper and a ballpoint pen.



WIPING THE TEARS off her face with the back of her hand, she folded the letter carefully. Envelope? No. If anybody found this, an envelope wouldnâ€™t stop them. She turned the letter over and, sniffing, wrote Roger, in her best parochial-school penmanship.



She groped in her pocket for a Kleenex and blew her nose, feeling obscurely that she should do something more . . . ceremonial? . . . with the letter, but other than putting it in the fireplace and touching a match to it so the north wind would carry it, as her parents had done with her childhood letters to Santa, nothing occurred to her.

In her present state of mind, she found it comforting that Santa had always come through.

She opened the big drawer and was groping at the back for the catch that released the secret hiding place when something else did occur to her. She slammed the big drawer shut and yanked open the wide shallow one in the center, which held pens and paper clips and rubber bandsâ€”and a lipstick left in the downstairs powder room by some random dinner guest.

It was pink but a dark pink, and it didnâ€™t matter that it clashed with her hair. She applied it hastily by feel, then pressed her lips carefully over the word Roger.

â€œI love you,â€ she whispered, and, touching the pink kiss with one fingertip, opened the big drawer again and pushed the spot that unlocked the hiding place. It wasnâ€™t a secret drawer but a space built into the underside of the desk. A sliding panel let you reach up into a shallow hole about six inches by eight.

When Roger discovered it, it had three stamps printed with the head of Queen Victoria in itâ€”unfortunately, all run-of-the-mill late-Victorian postage rather than a helpfully valuable One-Penny Blackâ€”and a wispy curl of a childâ€™s fine blond hair, faded with age, tied with white thread and a tiny scrap of heather. Theyâ€™d left the stamps thereâ€”who knew, maybe they would be valuable by the time another few generations inherited the deskâ€”but sheâ€™d put the lock of hair between the pages of her Bible and said a small prayer for the child and hisâ€”her?â€”parents, whenever she came across it.

The letter fit easily into the heart of the old desk. A moment of panic: should she have included locks of the kidsâ€™ hair? No, she thought fiercely. Donâ€™t be morbid. Sentimental, yes. Morbid, no.

â€œLord, let us all be together again,â€ she whispered, pushing down the fear, and, closing her eyes, shut the panel with a little click.

If she hadnâ€™t opened her eyes right as she withdrew her hand, sheâ€™d never have seen it. Just the edge of something hanging down at the back of the big drawer, barely visible. She reached up and found an envelope, far back, attached to the underside of the desk with Scotch tape. This had dried with age; her earlier slamming of the drawer had probably loosened it.

She turned the envelope over with a sense of something happening in a dream and was, dreamlike, not surprised to see the initials B.E.R. written on the yellowed envelope. Very slowly, she opened it.

Dearest Deadeye, she read, and felt each tiny hair on her body rise slow and silent, one at a time.

Dearest Deadeye,

Youâ€™ve just left me, after our wonderful afternoon among the clay pigeons. My ears are still ringing. Whenever we shoot, Iâ€™m torn between immense pride in your ability, envy of itâ€”and fear that you may someday need it.

What a queer feeling it is, writing this. I know that youâ€™ll eventually learn whoâ€”and perhaps, whatâ€”you are. But I have no idea how youâ€™ll come to that knowledge. Am I about to reveal you to yourself, or will this be old news when you find it? If weâ€™re both lucky, I may be able to tell you in person, when youâ€™re a little older. And if weâ€™re very lucky, it will come to nothing. But I darenâ€™t risk your life in that hope, and youâ€™re not yet old enough that I could tell you.

Iâ€™m sorry, sweetheart, thatâ€™s terribly melodramatic. And the last thing I want to do is alarm you. I have all the confidence in the world in you. But I am your father and thus prey to the fears that afflict all parentsâ€”that something dreadful and unpreventable will happen to oneâ€™s child, and you powerless to protect her.

â€œWhat the hell, Daddy?â€ She rubbed hard at the back of her neck to ease the prickling there.

Men whoâ€™ve lived through war usually donâ€™t talk about it, save to other soldiers. Men from my part of the Service donâ€™t talk to anyone, and not only because of the Official Secrets Act. But silence eats at the soul. I had to talk to someone, and my old friend Reggie Wakefield became my confessor.

(Thatâ€™s the Reverend Reginald Wakefield, a Church of Scotland minister who lives in Inverness. If youâ€™re reading this letter, Iâ€™ll very likely be dead. If Reggie is still alive and you are of age, go to see him; he has my permission to tell you anything he knows at that point.)

â€œOf age?â€ Hastily, she tried to calculate when this had been written. Clay pigeons. Shermanâ€™sâ€”the shooting range where heâ€™d taught her to use a shotgun. The shotgun had been a present for her fifteenth birthday. And her father had died soon after her seventeenth birthday.

The Service has nothing directly to do with this; donâ€™t go looking in that direction for information. I mention it only because thatâ€™s where I learned what a conspiracy looks like. I also met a great many people in the war, many of them in high places, and many of them strange; the two overlap more often than one might wish.

Why is this so hard to say? If Iâ€™m dead, your mother may have told you already the story of your birth. She promised me that she would never speak of it, so long as I lived, and Iâ€™m sure she hasnâ€™t. If Iâ€™m dead, though, she mightâ€”

Forgive me, darling. Itâ€™s hard to say, because I love your mother and I love you. And you are my daughter forever, but you were sired by another man.

All right, thatâ€™s out. Seeing it in black and white, my impulse is to rip this paper to bits and burn them, but I wonâ€™t. You have to know.

Shortly after the war ended, your mother and I came to Scotland. Something of a second honeymoon. She went out one afternoon to pick flowersâ€”and never came back. I searchedâ€”everyone searchedâ€”for months, but there was no sign, and eventually the police stoppedâ€”well, in fact they didnâ€™t stop suspecting me of murdering her, damn them, but they grew tired of harassing me. I had begun to put my life back together, made up my mind to move on, perhaps leave Britainâ€”and then Claire came back. Three years after her disappearance, she showed up in the Highlands, filthy, starved, batteredâ€”and pregnant.

Pregnant, she said, by a Jacobite Highlander from 1743 named James Fraser. I wonâ€™t go into all that was said between us; it was a long time ago and it doesnâ€™t matterâ€”save for the fact that IF your mother was telling the truth, and did indeed travel back in time, then you may have the ability to do it, too. I hope you donâ€™t. But if you shouldâ€”Lord, I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m writing this in all seriousness. But I look at you, darling, with the sun on your ruddy hair, and I see him. I canâ€™t deny that.

Well. It took a long time. A very long time. But your mother never changed her story, and though we didnâ€™t speak about it after a while, it became obvious that she wasnâ€™t mentally deranged (which I had rather naturally assumed to be the case, initially). And I began . . . to look for him.

Now I must digress for a moment; forgive me. I think you wonâ€™t have heard of the Brahan Seer. Colorful as he wasâ€”if, in fact, he existedâ€”heâ€™s not really known much beyond those circles with a taste for the more outlandish aspects of Scottish history. Reggie, though, is a man of immense curiosity, as well as immense learning, and was fascinated by the Seerâ€”one Kenneth MacKenzie, who lived in the seventeenth century (maybe), and who made a great number of prophecies about this and that, sometimes at the behest of the Earl of Seaforth.

Naturally, the only prophecies mentioned in connection with this man are the ones that appeared to come true: he predicted, for instance, that when there were five bridges over the River Ness, the world would fall into chaos. In August 1939 the fifth bridge over the Ness was opened, and in September, Hitler invaded Poland. Quite enough chaos for anyone.

The Seer came to a sticky end, as prophets often do (do please remember that, darling, will you?), burnt to death in a spiked barrel of tar at the instigation of Lady Seaforthâ€”to whom he had unwisely prophesied that her husband was having affairs with various ladies while away in Paris. (That one was likely true, in my opinion.)

Amongst his lesser-known prophecies, though, was one called the Fraser Prophecy. There isnâ€™t a great deal known about this, and what there is is rambling and vague, as prophecies usually are, the Old Testament notwithstanding. The only relevant bit, I think, is this: â€œThe last of Lovatâ€™s line will rule Scotland.â€

Pause if you will, now, dear, and look at the paper I am enclosing with this letter.

Fumbling and clumsy with shock, she dropped the sheets altogether and had to retrieve them from the floor. It was easy to tell which paper he meant; the paper was flimsier, a photocopy of a handwritten chartâ€”some sort of family treeâ€”the writing not her fatherâ€™s.

Yes. Well. This bit of disturbing information came into my hands from Reggie, whoâ€™d had it from the wife of a fellow named Stuart Lachlan. Lachlan had died suddenly, and as his widow was clearing out his desk, she found this and decided to pass it on to Reggie, knowing that he and Lachlan had shared an interest in history and in the Lovat family, they being local to Inverness; the clan seat is in Beauly. Reggie, of course, recognized the names.

You likely know nothing about the Scottish aristocracy, but I knew Simon Lovat, Lord Lovat that is, in the warâ€”he was Commandos, then Special Forces. We werenâ€™t close friends but knew each other casually, in the way of business, you might say.

â€œWhose business?â€ she said aloud, suspicious. â€œHis, or yours?â€ She could just see her fatherâ€™s face, with the hidden smile in the corner of his mouth, keeping something back but letting you know it was there.

The Frasers of Lovat have a fairly straightforward line of descent, until we come to Old Simonâ€”well, theyâ€™re all called Simonâ€”the one they call the Old Fox, who was executed for treason after the Jacobite Rebellionâ€”the â€™45, they call it. (Thereâ€™s quite a bit about him in my book on the Jacobites; donâ€™t know if youâ€™ll ever read that, but itâ€™s there, should you feel curious.)

â€œShould I feel curious,â€ she muttered. â€œHa.â€ Brianna sensed a definite, if muted, note of accusation there and pressed her lips together, as much annoyed at herself for not having read her fatherâ€™s books yet as at him for mentioning it.

Simon was one of the more colorful Frasers, in assorted ways. He had three wives but was not famous for fidelity. He did have a few legitimate children, and God knows how many illegitimate ones (though two illegitimate sons were acknowledged), but his heir was Young Simon, known as the Young Fox. Young Simon survived the Rising, though attainted and stripped of his property. He eventually got most of it back through the courts, but the struggle took him most of a long life, and while he married, he did so at a very advanced age and had no children. His younger brother, Archibald, inherited, but then died childless, as well.

So Archibald was the â€œlast of Lovatâ€™s lineâ€â€”thereâ€™s a direct line of descent between him and the Fraser of Lovat who would have been concurrent with the Brahan Seerâ€”but clearly he wasnâ€™t the Scottish ruler foreseen.

You see the chart, though. Whoever made it has listed the two illegitimate sons, as well as Young Simon and his brother. Alexander and Brian, born to different mothers. Alexander entered the priesthood and became the abbot of a monastery in France. No known children. But Brianâ€”



She tasted bile and thought she might throw up. But Brianâ€”She closed her eyes in reflex, but it didnâ€™t matter. The chart was burned on the inside of her eyelids.



She stood up, pushing back the chair with a screak, and lurched out into the hallway, heart thundering in her ears. Swallowing repeatedly, she went to the lobby and got the shotgun from its place behind the coat rack. She felt a little better with it in hand.

â€œIt isnâ€™t right.â€ She hadnâ€™t realized that sheâ€™d spoken aloud; her own voice startled her. â€œItâ€™s not right,â€ she repeated, in a low, fierce voice. â€œThey left people out. What about Aunt Jenny? She had six kids! What about them?â€

She was stomping down the hallway, gun in hand, swinging the barrel from side to side as though she expected Rob Cameronâ€”or somebody, and the thought made her shudderâ€”to jump out of the parlor or the kitchen or come sliding down the banister. That thought made her look up the stairsâ€”sheâ€™d left all the lights on when she came down from tucking in the kidsâ€”but the landing was empty and no noise came from above.

A little calmer, she searched the ground floor carefully, testing every door and window. And the priestâ€™s hole, whose empty blackness gaped mockingly up at her.

Jem and Mandy were all right. She knew they were. But she still went upstairs, soft-footed, and stood by their beds for a long time, watching the pale glow of the Snow White night-light on their faces.

The longcase clock in the hall below struck the hour, and then a single bong! She drew a deep breath and went down to finish reading her fatherâ€™s letter.

The current line of Fraser of Lovat is descended from a collateral branch; presumably the Fraser Prophecy isnâ€™t referring to one of themâ€”though there are plenty of heirs in that line.



I donâ€™t know who drew this chart, but I do intend to find out. This letter is in case I donâ€™t. In case of a number of things.

One of those things being the possibility that your motherâ€™s story is trueâ€”I still have difficulty believing it, when I wake in the morning beside her and everything is so normal. But late at night, when Iâ€™m alone with the documents . . . Well, why not admit it? I found the record of their marriage. James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser and Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp. Iâ€™m not sure whether to be grateful or outraged that she didnâ€™t marry him using my name.

Forgive me, Iâ€™m rambling. Itâ€™s hard to keep emotion out of it, but Iâ€™ll try. The essence of what Iâ€™m saying is this: if you can indeed go back in time (and possibly return), you are a person of very great interest to a number of people, for assorted reasons. Should anyone in the more shadowed realm of government be halfway convinced that you are what you may be, you would be watched. Possibly approached. (In earlier centuries, the British government pressed men into service. They still do, if less obviously.)

Thatâ€™s a very remote contingency, but it is a real one; I must mention it.

There are private parties who would also have a deep interest in you for this reasonâ€”and evidently there is someone who has spotted you and is watching. The chart showing your line of descent, with dates, indicates that much. It also suggests that this personâ€™s or personsâ€™ interest may be a concern with the Fraser Prophecy. What could be more intriguing to that sort of person than the prospect of someone who is â€œthe last of Lovatâ€™s lineâ€ and is also a time traveler? These sorts of peopleâ€”I know them wellâ€”invariably believe in mystic powers of all sortsâ€”nothing would draw them more powerfully than the conviction that you hold such power.

Such people are usually harmless. But they can be very dangerous indeed.

If I find whoever drew this chart, I will question them and do my best to neutralize any possible threat to you. But as I sayâ€”I know the look of a conspiracy. Nutters of this sort thrive in company. I might miss one.

â€œNeutralize them,â€ she murmured, the chill in her hands spreading through her arms and chest, crystallizing around her heart. She had no doubt at all what heâ€™d meant by that, the bland matter-of-factness of the term notwithstanding. And had he found himâ€”them?

Donâ€™tâ€”I repeat, donâ€™tâ€”go anywhere near the Service or anyone connected with it. At best, theyâ€™d think you insane. But if you are indeed what you may be, the last people who should ever know it are the funny buggers, as we used to be known during the war.

And if worse should come to worstâ€”and you can do itâ€”then the past may be your best avenue of escape. I have no idea how it works; neither does your mother, or at least she says so. I hope I may have given you a few tools to help, if that should be necessary.

And . . . thereâ€™s him. Your mother said that Fraser sent her back to me, knowing that I would protect herâ€”and you. She thought that he died immediately afterward. He did not. I looked for him, and I found him. And, like him, perhaps I send you back, knowingâ€”as he knew of meâ€”that he will protect you with his life.

I will love you forever, Brianna. And I know whose child you truly are.

With all my love,

Dad





APPARITION

THE LOCHABER DISTRICT, according to the North of Scotland Hydro Electric Board (as interpreted by Brianna), is a â€œhigh glaciated landscape.â€

â€œThat means it goes up and down a lot,â€ Roger explained to Buck, as they fought their way through what he thought was part of the Locheil Forest, looking for the edge of Loch Lochy.

â€œYe donâ€™t say?â€ Buck glanced bleakly over his shoulder at the distant hump of Ben Nevis, then back at Roger. â€œIâ€™d not noticed.â€

â€œCheer up, itâ€™s all downhill for a bit now. And the midgies are all dead wiâ€™ the cold. Count your blessings.â€ Roger felt unaccountably cheerful this morningâ€”perhaps only because the walking was downhill, after a strenuous week of combing the Cameron clan lands, a bewildering network of corries, tarns, moraines, and Munros, those deceptive summits with their gently rounded tops and their unspeakable slopes. Thank God no one lived on top of them.

Perhaps also because, while they hadnâ€™t found Jem or any trace of him, it was progress, of a sort. The Camerons on the whole had been hospitable, after the initial surprise, and theyâ€™d had the luck to find a tacksman of Lochiel, the clan chieftain, whoâ€™d sent a man to Tor Castle for them. Word had come back a day later: no word of a stranger matching Rob Cameronâ€™s descriptionâ€”though, in fact, Rob looked like half the people Roger had met in the last few daysâ€”or Jemâ€™s, he being a lot more noticeable.

Theyâ€™d worked their way back along the shores of Loch Arkaigâ€”the fastest way for someone to travel from the Great Glen, if heading for the ocean. But no word of a boat stolen or hired, and Roger began to feel that Cameron had not, after all, sought refuge or help among his ancient clanâ€”a relief, on the whole.



â€œBlessings, is it?â€ Buck rubbed a hand over his face. Neither of them had shaved in a week, and he looked as red-eyed and grubby as Roger felt. He scratched his jaw consideringly. â€œAye, well. A fox took a shit next to me last night, but I didna step in it this morning. I suppose thatâ€™ll do, for a start.â€

The next day and night dampened Rogerâ€™s mood of optimism somewhat: it rained incessantly, and they spent the night under heaps of half-dry bracken on the edge of a black tarn, emerging at dawn chilled and frowsty, to the shrieks of plovers and killdeer.

He hesitated momentarily as they rode past the place where they might turn toward Cranesmuir; he wanted badly to talk again with Dr. McEwan. His hand found his throat, thumb stroking the scar. â€œMaybe,â€ the healer had said. â€œJust maybe.â€ But McEwan couldnâ€™t aid them in looking for Jem; that visit would have to wait.

Still, he felt his heart rise as they came over the pass and saw Lallybroch below. It was bittersweet, coming home to a home that was not his and might never be again. But it promised refuge and succor, if only temporarilyâ€”and it promised hope, at least in these last few minutes before they reached the door.

â€œOch, itâ€™s you!â€ It was Jenny Fraser who opened the door, her look of wariness changing to one of pleased welcome. Roger heard Buck behind him making a small humming noise of approval at sight of her, and, despite his determination not to hope too much, Roger felt his own spirits rise.

â€œAnd this will be your kinsman?â€ She curtsied to Buck. â€œWelcome to ye, sir. Come ben; Iâ€™ll call Taggie to mind the horses.â€ She turned in a flicker of white apron and petticoats, beckoning them to follow. â€œDaâ€™s in the speak-a-word,â€ she called over her shoulder as she headed for the kitchen. â€œHeâ€™s something for you!â€

â€œMr. MacKenzie and . . . this would be also Mr. MacKenzie, aye?â€ Brian Fraser came out of the study, smiling, and offered Buck his hand. Roger could see him looking Buck over with close attention, a slight frown between his dark brows. Not disapprovalâ€”puzzlement, as though he knew Buck from somewhere and was trying to think where.

Roger knew exactly where and felt again that peculiar quiver heâ€™d felt on meeting Dougal MacKenzie. The resemblance between father and son was by no means instantly strikingâ€”their coloring was very different, and Roger thought most of Buckâ€™s features came from his motherâ€”but there was a fugitive similarity, nonetheless, something in their manner. Men cocksure of their charmâ€”and no less charming for knowing it.

Buck was smiling, making commonplace courtesies, complimenting the house and its estate. . . . The puzzlement faded from Brianâ€™s eyes, and he invited them to sit, calling down the hall to the kitchen for someone to bring them a bite and a dram.

â€œWell, then,â€ Brian said, pulling out the chair from behind his desk in order to sit with them. â€œAs ye havena got the lad with ye, I see heâ€™s not found yet. Have ye heard any news of him, though?â€ He looked from Buck to Roger, worried but hopeful.

â€œNo,â€ Roger said, and cleared his throat. â€œNot a word. Butâ€”your daughter said that you . . . might have heard something?â€



Fraserâ€™s face changed at once, lighting a little.

â€œWell, itâ€™s nay so much heard anything, but . . .â€ He rose and went to rummage in the desk, still talking.

â€œA captain from the garrison came by here twa, three days ago, wiâ€™ a small party of soldiers. The new man in chargeâ€”what was his name, Jenny?â€ For Jenny had come in with a tray, this holding a teapot, cups, a small bottle of whisky, and a plate of cake. The smell made Rogerâ€™s stomach rumble.

â€œWho? Oh, the new redcoat captain? Randall, he said. Jonathan Randall.â€ Her color rose a little, and her father smiled to see it. Roger felt the smile freeze on his own face.

â€œAye, he took to you, lass. Wouldna be surprised if he came back one of these days.â€

â€œPrecious little good it will do him if he does,â€ Jenny snapped. â€œHave ye lost that thing, an athair?â€

â€œNo, no, Iâ€™m sure I put . . .â€ Brianâ€™s voice trailed off as he scrabbled in the drawer. â€œOh. Erm, aye.â€ He coughed, hand in the drawer, and, through his shock, Roger realized what the trouble was. The desk had a secret compartment. Evidently Brian had put the â€œthing,â€ whatever it was, in the hiding place and was now wondering how to get it out again without revealing the secret to his visitors.

Roger rose to his feet.

â€œWill ye pardon me, mistress?â€ he asked, bowing to Jenny. â€œIâ€™d forgot something in my saddlebag. Come with me, aye?â€ he added to Buck. â€œItâ€™s maybe in with your things.â€

Jenny looked surprised but nodded, and Roger blundered out, Buck making little grunts of annoyance at his heels.

â€œWhat the devilâ€™s wrong wiâ€™ you?â€ Buck said, the minute they were out the door. â€œYe went white as a sheet in there, and ye still look like a fish thatâ€™s been dead a week.â€

â€œI feel like one,â€ Roger said tersely. â€œI know Captain Randallâ€”or, rather, I know a lot of things about him. Leave it that heâ€™s the last person Iâ€™d want to have any knowledge of Jem.â€

â€œOh.â€ Buckâ€™s face went blank, then firmed. â€œAye, well. Weâ€™ll see what it is he brought, and then weâ€™ll go and have it out with him if we think he might have the lad.â€

What it is he brought. Roger fought back all the horrible things that phrase conjuredâ€”Jemâ€™s ear, a finger, a lock of his hairâ€”because if it had been anything like that, surely the Frasers wouldnâ€™t be calm about it. But if Randall had brought some hideous token in a box?

â€œWhy, though?â€ Buck was frowning, plainly trying to read Rogerâ€™s expression, which, judging from Buckâ€™s own, must be appalling. â€œWhy would this man mean you and the lad ill? Heâ€™s never met ye, has he?â€

â€œThat,â€ Roger said, choking down his feelings, â€œis an excellent question. But the man is aâ€”do you know what a sadist is?â€

â€œNo, but itâ€™s plainly something ye dinna want close to your wean. Here, sir! Weâ€™ll be taking those in, thank ye kindly.â€ Theyâ€™d come right round the house by now, and McTaggart the hired man was coming down the path from the stable, their saddlebags in either hand.



McTaggart looked surprised but surrendered the heavy bags gladly and went back to his work.

â€œI ken ye just wanted to get us out of there so to give your man a bit of privacy to work the secret drawer,â€ Buck remarked. â€œAnd he kens that fine. Do we need to take in something, though?â€

â€œHow do you know aboutâ€”â€ Buck grinned at him, and Roger dismissed the question with an irritable gesture. â€œYes. Weâ€™ll give Miss Fraser the cheese I bought yesterday.â€

â€œAh, Mrs. Jenny.â€ Buck made the humming noise again. â€œI wouldna blame Captain Randall. That skin! And those bubs, come to thatâ€”â€

â€œShut up right this minute!â€

Buck did, shocked out of his jocularity.

â€œWhat?â€ he said, in quite a different tone. â€œWhat is it?â€

Roger unclenched his fist, with an effort.

â€œItâ€™s a bloody long story; I havenâ€™t time to tell it to ye now. But itâ€™sâ€”something I know from the other end. From my time. In a year or so, Randallâ€™s coming back here. And heâ€™s going to do something terrible. And, God help me, I donâ€™t think I can stop it.â€

â€œSomething terrible,â€ Buck repeated slowly. His eyes were boring into Rogerâ€™s own, dark as serpentine. â€œTo that bonnie wee lass? And ye think ye canâ€™t stop it? Why, man, how can yeâ€”â€

â€œJust shut up,â€ Roger repeated doggedly. â€œWeâ€™ll talk about it later, aye?â€

Buck puffed out his cheeks, still staring at Roger, then blew out his breath with a sound of disgust and shook his head, but he picked up his saddlebag and followed without further argument.

The cheeseâ€”a thing the size of Rogerâ€™s outstretched hand, wrapped in fading leavesâ€”was received with pleasure and taken off to the kitchen, leaving Roger and Buck alone once more with Brian Fraser. Fraser had regained his own composure and, picking up a tiny cloth-wrapped parcel from his desk, put it gently in Rogerâ€™s hand.

Too light to be a finger . . .

â€œCaptain Randall said that Captain Buncombe sent word out wiâ€™ all the patrols, and one of them came across this wee bawbee and sent it back to Fort William. None of them ever saw such a thing before, but because of the name, they were thinking it might have to do wiâ€™ your lad.â€

â€œThe name?â€ Roger untied the cord and the cloth fell open. For an instant, he didnâ€™t know what the hell he was seeing. He picked it up; it was light as a feather, dangling from his fingers.

Two disks, made of something like pressed cardboard, threaded onto a bit of light woven cord. One round, colored redâ€”the other was green and octagonal.

â€œOh, Jesus,â€ he said. â€œOh, Christ Jesus.â€

J. W. MacKenzie was printed on both disks, along with a number and two letters. He turned the red disk gently over with a shaking fingertip and read what he already knew was stamped there.

RAF

He was holding the dog tags of a Royal Air Force flier. Circa World War II.





AMPHISBAENA

â€œYE CANNA BE SURE those things name your father.â€ Buck nodded at the dog tags, their cord still wrapped round Rogerâ€™s hand, the tiny disks themselves folded tight in his palm. â€œHow many MacKenzies are there, for Godâ€™s sake?â€

â€œLots.â€ Roger sat down on a big lichen-covered boulder. They were at the top of the hill that rose behind Lallybroch; the broch itself stood on the slope just below them, its conical roof a broad black whorl of slates. â€œBut not so bloody many who flew for the Royal Air Force in World War Two. And even fewer who disappeared without a trace. As for those who might be time travelers . . .â€

Roger couldnâ€™t remember what heâ€™d said when he saw the dog tags or what Brian Fraser had said to him. When heâ€™d started to notice things again, he was sitting in Brianâ€™s big wheel-backed chair with a stoneware mug of hot tea cupped between his hands and the entire household crammed into the doorway, regarding him with looks ranging from compassion to curiosity. Buck was squatting in front of him, frowning in what might have been concern or simply curiosity.

â€œSorry,â€ Roger had said, cleared his throat, and set the tea undrunk on the desk. His hands throbbed from the heat of the cup. â€œRather a shock. Iâ€”thank you.â€

â€œIs it something to do wiâ€™ your wee boy, then?â€ Jenny Fraser had asked, deep-blue eyes dark with concern.

â€œI think so, yes.â€ Heâ€™d got his wits back now and rose stiffly, nodding to Brian. â€œThank ye, sir. I canna thank ye enough for all yeâ€™ve done for meâ€”for us. I . . . need to think a bit whatâ€™s to do now. If yeâ€™ll excuse me, Mistress Fraser?â€

Jenny nodded, not taking her eyes from his face but shooing the maids and the cook away from the door so he could pass through it. Buck had followed him, murmuring reassuring things to the multitude, and come along with him, not speaking until they reached the solitude of the craggy hilltop. Where Roger had explained just what the dog tags were and to whom they had belonged.

â€œWhy two?â€ Buck asked, reaching out a tentative finger to touch the tags. â€œAnd why are they different colors?â€

â€œTwo in case one was destroyed by whatever killed you,â€ Roger said, taking a deep breath. â€œThe colorsâ€”theyâ€™re made of pressed cardboard treated with different chemicalsâ€”substances, I mean. One resists water and the other resists fire, but I couldnâ€™t tell ye which is which.â€

Speaking of technicalities made it just barely possible to speak. Buck, with unaccustomed delicacy, was waiting for Roger to bring up the unspeakable.

How did the tags turn up here? And whenâ€”and under what circumstancesâ€”had they become detached from J(eremiah) W(alter)MacKenzie, Roman Catholic, serial number 448397651, RAF?

â€œClaireâ€”my mother-in-lawâ€”I told ye about her, did I not?â€

â€œA bit, aye. A seer, was she?â€

Roger laughed shortly. â€œAye, like I am. Like you are. Easy to be a seer if what you see has already happened.â€

Whatâ€™s already happened . . .

â€œOh, God,â€ he said out loud, and curled over, pressing the fist that held the dog tags hard against his forehead.

â€œAll right, there?â€ Buck asked after a moment. Roger straightened up with a deep breath.

â€œKnow the expression â€˜damned if ye do, damned if ye donâ€™tâ€™?â€

â€œNo, though I wouldna think it was one a minister would use.â€ Buckâ€™s mouth twitched into a half smile. â€œAre ye not dedicated to the notion that thereâ€™s always one sure way out oâ€™ damnation?â€

â€œA minister. Aye.â€ Roger breathed deep again. There was a lot of oxygen on a Scottish hilltop, but somehow there didnâ€™t seem quite enough just this minute. â€œIâ€™m not sure that religion was constructed with time travelers in mind.â€

Buckâ€™s brows rose at that.

â€œConstructed?â€ he echoed, surprised. â€œWho builds God?â€

That actually made Roger laugh, which made him feel a little better, if only momentarily.

â€œWe all do,â€ he said dryly. â€œIf God makes man in His image, we all return the favor.â€

â€œMmphm.â€ Buck thought that one over, then nodded slowly. â€œWouldna just say yeâ€™re wrong about that. But Godâ€™s there, nonetheless, whether we ken quite what He is or not. Isnâ€™t He?â€

â€œYeah.â€ Roger wiped his knuckles under his nose, which had begun to run with the cold wind. â€œEver hear of Saint Teresa of Avila?â€

â€œNo.â€ Buck gave him a look. â€œNor have I heard of a Protestant minister who has to do wiâ€™ saints.â€

â€œI take advice where I can get it. But St. Teresa once remarked to God, â€˜If this is how you treat your friends, no wonder you have so few of them.â€™ Godâ€™s got his own ways.â€

Buck smiled; it was one of his rare, unwary smiles, and it heartened Roger enough to try to come to grips with the situation.

â€œWell, Claireâ€”my mother-in-lawâ€”she told Brianna and me a good bit. About the things that happened when she went through the stones in 1743, and about things that had happened before that. Things about Captain Randall.â€ And in sentences as brief and unemotional as he could make them, he told the story: Randallâ€™s raid on Lallybroch while Brian Fraser was away, his attack on Jenny Murray, and how Jamie Fraserâ€”newly returned from Paris and wondering what to do with his lifeâ€”had fought for his home and his sisterâ€™s honor, been arrested and taken to Fort William, where he had been flogged nearly to death.

â€œTwice,â€ Roger said, pausing for air. He swallowed. â€œThe second time . . . Brian was there. He thought Jamie was dead, and he had a strokeâ€”an apoplexyâ€”on the spot. He . . . died.â€ He swallowed again. â€œWill die.â€

â€œJesus, Mary, and Bride.â€ Buck crossed himself. His face had gone pale. â€œYour man in the house? Heâ€™ll be dead in a year or two?â€

â€œYes.â€ Roger looked down at Lallybroch, pale and peaceful as the sheep that browsed its pastures. â€œAnd . . . thereâ€™s more. What happened later, just before the Rising.â€

Buck raised a hand.

â€œI say thatâ€™s more than enough. I say we go down to Fort William and do for the wicked bugger now. Preemptive action, ye might say. Thatâ€™s a legal term,â€ he explained, with an air of kindly condescension.

â€œAn appealing notion,â€ Roger said dryly. â€œBut if we didâ€”what would happen four years from now?â€

Buck frowned, not comprehending.

â€œWhen Claire came through the stones in 1743, she metâ€”will meetâ€”Jamie Fraser, an outlaw with a price on his head, coming home from France. But if what happened with Captain Randall doesnâ€™t happenâ€”Jamie wonâ€™t be there. And if he isnâ€™t . . . ?â€

â€œOh.â€ The frown grew deeper, comprehension dawning. â€œOh, aye. I see. No Jamie, no Brianna . . .â€

â€œNo Jem or Mandy,â€ Roger finished. â€œExactly.â€

â€œOh, God.â€ Buck bent his head and massaged the flesh between his brows with two fingers. â€œDamned if ye do, damned if ye donâ€™t, did ye say? Enough to make your head spin like a top.â€

â€œYes, it is. But I have to do something, nonetheless.â€ He rubbed a thumb gently over the dog tagsâ€™ surfaces. â€œIâ€™m going down to Fort William to talk to Captain Randall. I have to know where these came from.â€



BUCK LOOKED squiggle-eyed at the tags, lips pressed together, then switched the look to Roger.

â€œDâ€™ye think your ladâ€™s with your father, somehow?â€

â€œNo.â€ That particular thought hadnâ€™t occurred to Roger, and it shook him for a moment. He shrugged it away, though.

â€œNo,â€ he repeated more firmly. â€œIâ€™m beginning to think that maybe . . . maybe Jemâ€™s not here at all.â€ The statement hung there in the air, revolving slowly. He glanced at Buck, who seemed to be glowering at it.

â€œWhy not?â€ his kinsman asked abruptly.

â€œA, because weâ€™ve found no hint of him. And B, because now thereâ€™s these.â€ He raised the tags, the light cardboard disks lifting in the breeze.

â€œYe sound like your wife,â€ Buck said, half amused. â€œShe does that, aye? Layinâ€™ things out, A, B, C, and all.â€



â€œThatâ€™s how Briannaâ€™s mind works,â€ Roger said, feeling a brief surge of affection for her. â€œSheâ€™s very logical.â€

And if Iâ€™m right, and Jemâ€™s not hereâ€”where is he? Has he gone to another timeâ€”or did he not travel at all? As though the word â€œlogicalâ€ had triggered it, a whole array of horrifying possibilities opened out before him.

â€œWhat Iâ€™m thinkingâ€”we were both concentrating on the name â€˜Jeremiahâ€™ when we came through, aye?â€

â€œAye, we were.â€

â€œWell . . .â€ He twirled the cord between his fingers, making the disks spin slowly. â€œWhat if we got the wrong Jeremiah? That was my fatherâ€™s name, too. Andâ€”and if Rob Cameron didnâ€™t take Jem through the stonesâ€”â€

â€œWhy would he not?â€ Buck interrupted sharply. He transferred the glower to Roger. â€œHis truck was there at Craigh na Dun. He wasnâ€™t.â€

â€œPlainly he wanted us to think heâ€™d gone through. As to whyâ€”â€ He choked on the thought. Before he could clear his throat, Buck finished it for him.

â€œTo get us away, so heâ€™d have your missus to himself.â€ His face darkened with angerâ€”part of it aimed at Roger. â€œI told her yon man had a hot eye for her.â€

â€œMaybe he does,â€ he said shortly. â€œBut think, aye? Beyond whatever he may have had in mind with regard to Briannaâ€”â€ The mere words conjured up pictures that made the blood shoot up into his head. â€œWhatever he had in mind,â€ he repeated, as calmly as he could, â€œhe likely also wanted to see whether it was true. About the stones. About whether weâ€”or anyoneâ€”really could go through. Seeingâ€™s believing, after all.â€

Buck blew out his cheeks, considering.

â€œYe think he was there, maybe? Watching to see if we disappeared?â€

Roger shrugged, momentarily unable to speak for the thoughts clotting his brain.

Buckâ€™s fists were clenched on his knees. He looked down at the house, then behind him at the rising mountains, and Roger knew exactly what he was thinking. He cleared his throat with a hacking growl.

â€œWeâ€™ve been gone for two weeks,â€ Roger said. â€œIf he meant Brianna harm . . . heâ€™ll have tried.â€ Jesus. If heâ€”no. â€œSheâ€™ll not have let him harm her or the kids,â€ he went on, as steadily as he could. â€œIf he tried anything, heâ€™ll either be in jail or buried under the broch.â€ He lifted his chin toward the tower below, and Buck snorted in reluctant amusement.

â€œSo, then. Aye, I want to rush straight back to Craigh na Dun, too. But think, man. We ken Cameron went to the stones after he took Jem. Would he not make Jem touch them, to see? And if he did . . . what if Cameron canâ€™t travel but Jem didâ€”to get away from him?â€

â€œMmphm.â€ Buck thought that one over and gave a reluctant nod. â€œSo yeâ€™re maybe thinkinâ€™ that if the lad was scairt of Cameron and popped through accidental, he maybe wouldnâ€™t try to come straight back?â€

â€œHe maybe couldnâ€™t.â€ Roger was dry-mouthed and swallowed hard to generate enough saliva to speak. â€œHe didnâ€™t have a gemstone. And even with one . . .â€ He nodded at Buck. â€œKen what happened to you, even with one. It does get worse each time. Jemmy might have been too scared to try.â€ And he might have tried, not made it, and now heâ€™s lost for good . . . NO!

Buck nodded.

â€œSo. Ye think heâ€™s maybe with your da, after all?â€ He sounded dubious in the extreme.

Roger couldnâ€™t bear sitting any longer. He stood up abruptly, thrusting the dog tags into the breast pocket of his coat.

â€œI donâ€™t know. But this is the only solid bit of evidence we have. I have to go and see.â€





THE CURE OF SOULS

â€œYEâ€™RE OUT OF YOUR wee pink mind, ye ken that, aye?â€ Roger looked at Buck in amazement.

â€œWhere the devil did you get that expression?â€

â€œFrom your wife,â€ Buck replied. â€œWhoâ€™s a verra bonnie lass and a well-spoken one, forbye. And if ye mean to get back to her bed one of these days, yeâ€™ll think better of what ye mean to do.â€

â€œIâ€™ve thought,â€ Roger said briefly. â€œAnd Iâ€™m doing it.â€ The entrance to Fort William looked much as it had when heâ€™d come here with Brian Fraser nearly two weeks earlier, but this time with only a few people hastening in, shawls over their heads, and hats pulled down against the rain. The fort itself now seemed to have a sinister aspect, the gray stones bleak and streaked black with wet.

Buck reined up, grimacing as the horse shook its head and sprayed him with drops from its soaking mane.

â€œAye, fine. Iâ€™m no going in there. If we have to kill him, itâ€™s best if he doesna ken me, so I can get behind him. Iâ€™ll wait at yonder tavern.â€ He lifted his chin, indicating an establishment called the Peartree, a few hundred feet down the road from the fort, then kicked his horse into motion. Ten feet on, he turned and called over his shoulder, â€œOne hour! If yeâ€™re not with me by then, Iâ€™m cominâ€™ in after ye!â€

Roger smiled, despite his apprehension. He waved briefly to Buck and swung off his horse.

Bless me, Lord, he prayed. Help me to do the right thingâ€”for everyone. Including Buck. And him.



He hadnâ€™t actually stopped praying at any time since Jem had disappeared, though most of it was just the frantic, reflexive Dear Lord, let it be all right of everyone facing crisis. Over time, either the crisis or the petitioner wears down, and prayer either ceases or . . . the person praying starts to listen.

He knew that. And he was listening. But he was still taken aback to get an answer.

He had enough experience in the business of prayer to recognize an answer when it showed up, though, however unwelcome. And the pointed reminder, arriving as a random thought in the middle of their mud-spattered, rain-sodden journeyâ€”that Jack Randallâ€™s soul was in as much danger as Brian Fraserâ€™s lifeâ€”was damned unwelcome.

â€œWell, then,â€ Buck had said, brightening under the soggy brim of his hat when Roger had shared his disturbance at this insight. â€œAll the more reason to kill him now. Save yon Frasers, and keep the wicked wee sod from going to hellâ€”if he hasnâ€™t done something already as would send him there,â€ heâ€™d added as an afterthought. â€œTwo birds wiâ€™ one stone, aye?â€

Roger had squelched along for a moment before replying.

â€œOut of sheer curiosityâ€”were you a solicitor or a barrister, when ye did law?â€

â€œSolicitor. Why?â€

â€œNo wonder you failed at it. All your talents lie in the other direction. Can ye not have a conversation without arguing?â€

â€œNot wiâ€™ you,â€ Buck had said pointedly, and kicked his horse into a trot, sending up thumping clods of mud in his wake.

Roger gave his name and asked the army clerk if he might have a word with Captain Randall, then stood by the peat fire, shaking off as much water as he could before the man came back to lead him to Randallâ€™s office.

To his surprise, it was the same office where he and Brian Fraser had had their audience with Captain Buncombe almost two weeks before. Randall was seated behind the desk, quill in hand, but looked up with a courteous expression at Rogerâ€™s entrance and half rose, with a small bow.

â€œYour servant, sir. Mr. MacKenzie, is that right? Youâ€™ve come from Lallybroch, I collect.â€

â€œYour most obedient, sir,â€ Roger replied, adjusting his accent back to his normal Scots-tinged Oxbridge. â€œMr. Brian Fraser was good enough to give me the object that you brought. I wanted both to thank you for your kind assistanceâ€”and to ask whether you might be able to tell me where the object was discovered.â€

He knew about the banality of evil; human monsters came in human shapes. Even so, he was surprised. Randall was a handsome man, rather elegant in bearing, with a lively, interested expression, a humorous curve to his mouth, and warm dark eyes.

Well, he is human. And perhaps heâ€™s not a monster yet.

â€œOne of my messengers brought it in,â€ Randall replied, wiping his quill and dropping it into a stoneware jar full of such objects. â€œMy predecessor, Captain Buncombe, had sent dispatches to Fort George and Fort Augustus about your sonâ€”I am very sorry for your situation,â€ he added rather formally. â€œA patrol from Ruthven Barracks had brought the ornament in. Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t know where they discovered it, but perhaps the messenger who brought it from Ruthven does. Iâ€™ll send for him.â€

Randall went to the door and spoke to the sentry outside. Coming back, he paused to open a cupboard, which revealed a wig stand, a powdering shaker, a pair of hairbrushes, a looking glass, and a small tray with a cut-glass decanter and glasses.

â€œAllow me to offer you refreshment, sir.â€ Randall poured a cautious inch into each glass and offered one to Roger. He picked up his own, his nostrils flaring slightly at the scent of the whisky. â€œThe nectar of the country, Iâ€™m given to understand,â€ he said with a wry smile. â€œI am told I must develop a taste for it.â€ He took a wary sip, looking as though he expected imminent death to result.

â€œIf I might suggest . . . a bit of water mixed with it is customary,â€ Roger said, carefully keeping all trace of amusement out of his voice. â€œSome say it opens the flavor, makes it smoother.â€

â€œOh, really?â€ Randall put down his glass, looking relieved. â€œThat seems sensible. The stuff tastes as though itâ€™s flammable. Sanders!â€ he shouted toward the door. â€œBring some water!â€

There was a slight pause, neither man knowing quite what to say next.

â€œThe, um, thing,â€ Randall said. â€œMight I see it again? Itâ€™s quite remarkable. Is it a jewel of some kind? An ornament?â€

â€œNo. Itâ€™s a . . . sort of charm,â€ Roger said, fishing the dog tags out of his pocket. He felt an ache in his chest at thought of the small personal rituals that the fliers didâ€”a lucky stone in the pocket, a special scarf, the name of a woman painted on the nose of a plane. Charms. Tiny bits of hopeful magic, protection against a vast sky filled with fire and death. â€œTo preserve the soul.â€ In memory, at least.

Randall frowned a little, glancing from the dog tags to Rogerâ€™s face, then back. He was clearly thinking the same thing Roger was: And if the charm is detached from the person it was meant to protect . . . But he didnâ€™t say anything, merely touched the green tag gently.

â€œJ. W. Your sonâ€™s name is Jeremiah, I understand?â€

â€œYes. Jeremiahâ€™s an old family name. It was my fatherâ€™s name. Iâ€”â€ He was interrupted by the entrance of Private MacDonald, a very young soldier, dripping wet and slightly blue with cold, who saluted Captain Randall smartly, then gave way to a rattling cough that shook his spindly frame.

Once recovered, he complied at once with Randallâ€™s order to tell Roger all he knew about the dog tagsâ€”but he didnâ€™t know much. One of the soldiers stationed at Ruthven Barracks had won them in a dice game at a local pub. He did recall the name of the pubâ€”the Fatted Grouse; heâ€™d drunk there himselfâ€”and he thought the soldier had said heâ€™d won the bawbee from a farmer come back from the market in Perth.

â€œDo you recall the name of the soldier who won them?â€ Roger asked.

â€œOh, aye, sir. â€™Twas Sergeant McLehose. And now I thinkâ€”â€ A broad grin at the recollection showed crooked teeth. â€œI mind me of the farmerâ€™s name, too! â€™Twas Mr. Anthony Cumberpatch. It did tickle Sergeant McLehose, beinâ€™ foreign and soundinâ€™ like â€˜cucumber patch.â€™â€ He sniggered, and Roger smiled himself. Captain Randall cleared his throat, and the sniggering stopped abruptly, Private MacDonald snapping to a sober attention.

â€œThank you, Mr. MacDonald,â€ Randall said dryly. â€œThat will be all.â€

Private MacDonald, abashed, saluted and left. There was a momentâ€™s silence, during which Roger became aware of the rain, grown harder now, clattering like gravel on the large casement window. A chilly draft leaked around its frame and touched his face. Glancing at the window, he saw the drill yard below, and the whipping post, a grim crucifix stark and solitary, black in the rain.

Oh, God.

Carefully, he folded up the dog tags again and put them away in his pocket. Then met Captain Randallâ€™s dark eyes directly.

â€œDid Captain Buncombe tell you, sir, that I am a minister?â€

Randallâ€™s brows rose in brief surprise.

â€œNo, he didnâ€™t.â€ Randall was plainly wondering why Roger should mention this, but he was courteous. â€œMy younger brother is a clergyman. Ah . . . Church of England, of course.â€ There was the faintest implied question there, and Roger answered it with a smile.

â€œI am a minister of the Church of Scotland myself, sir. But if I might . . . will ye allow me to offer a blessing? For the success of my kinsman and myselfâ€”and in thanks for your kind help to us.â€

â€œIâ€”â€ Randall blinked, clearly discomfited. â€œIâ€”suppose so. Er . . . all right.â€ He leaned back a little, looking wary, hands on his blotter. He was completely taken aback when Roger leaned forward and grasped both his hands firmly. Randall gave a start, but Roger held tight, eyes on the captainâ€™s.

â€œOh, Lord,â€ he said, â€œwe ask thy blessing on our works. Guide me and my kinsman in our quest, and guide this man in his new office. May your light and presence be with us and with him, and your judgment and compassion ever on us. I commend him to your care. Amen.â€

His voice cracked on the last word, and he let go Randallâ€™s hands and coughed, looking away as he cleared his throat.

Randall cleared his throat, too, in embarrassment, but kept his poise.

â€œI thank you for your . . . er . . . good wishes, Mr. MacKenzie. And I wish you good luck. And good day.â€

â€œThe same to you, Captain,â€ Roger said, rising. â€œGod be with you.â€





BABY JESUS, TELL ME . . .

Boston, November 15, 1980

DR. JOSEPH ABERNATHY pulled into his driveway, looking forward to a cold beer and a hot supper. The mailbox was full; he pulled out a handful of circulars and envelopes and went inside, tidily sorting them as he went.

â€œBill, bill, occupant, junk, junk, more junk, charity appeal, bill, idiot, bill, invitation . . . hi, sweetieâ€”â€ He paused for a fragrant kiss from his wife, followed by a second sniff of her hair. â€œOh, man, are we having brats and sauerkraut for dinner?â€

â€œYou are,â€ his wife told him, neatly snagging her jacket from the hall tree with one hand and squeezing his buttock with the other. â€œIâ€™m going to a meeting with Marilyn. Be back by nine, if the rain doesnâ€™t make the traffic too bad. Anything good in the mail?â€

â€œNah. Have fun!â€

She rolled her eyes at him and left before he could ask if sheâ€™d bought Bud. He tossed the half-sorted mail on the kitchen counter and opened the refrigerator to check. A gleaming red-and-white six-pack beckoned cheerily, and the warm air was so tangy with the smells of fried sausage and vinegar that he could taste it without even taking the lid off the pan sitting on the stove.

â€œA good woman is prized above rubies,â€ he said, inhaling blissfully and pulling a can loose from its plastic ring.

He was halfway through the first plate of food and two-thirds of the way into his second beer when he put down the sports section of the Globe and saw the letter on top of the spilled pile of mail. He recognized Breeâ€™s handwriting at once; it was big and round, with a determined rightward slantâ€”but there was something wrong with the letter.

He picked it up, frowning a little, wondering why it looked strange . . . and then realized that the stamp was wrong. She wrote at least once a month, sending photos of the kids, telling him about her job, the farmâ€”and the letters all had British stamps, purple and blue heads of Queen Elizabeth. This one had an American stamp.

He slowly set down the letter as though it might explode and swallowed the rest of the beer in one gulp. Fortified, he set his jaw and picked it up.

â€œTell me you and Rog took the kids to Disneyland, Bree,â€ he murmured, licking mustard off his knife before using it to slit the envelope. Sheâ€™d talked about doing that someday. â€œBaby Jesus, tell me this is a photo of Jem shaking hands with Mickey Mouse.â€

Much to his relief, it was a photo of both children at Disneyland, beaming at the camera from Mickey Mouseâ€™s embrace, and he laughed out loud. Then he saw the tiny key that had fallen out of the envelopeâ€”the key to a bankâ€™s safe-deposit box. He set down the photo, went and got another beer, and sat down deliberately to read the brief note enclosed with the photo.

Dear Uncle Joe,

Iâ€™m taking the kids to see Grandma and Grandpa. I donâ€™t know when weâ€™ll be back; could you please see to things while weâ€™re gone? (Instructions in the box.)

Thank you for everything, always. Iâ€™ll miss you. I love you.

Bree

He sat for a long time next to the cold grease congealing on his plate, looking at the bright, happy photo.

â€œJesus, girl,â€ he said softly. â€œWhatâ€™s happened? And what do you mean youâ€™re taking the kids? Where the hellâ€™s Roger?â€





PART THREE



A Blade New-Made from

the Ashes of the Forge





SOMETHING SUITABLE IN WHICH TO GO TO WAR

June 19, 1778

Philadelphia

I WOKE COMPLETELY disoriented, to the splat of water dripping into a wooden bucket, the sharp smells of wood pulp and printerâ€™s ink, the softer musk of Jamieâ€™s body and frying bacon, the clank of pewter plates, and the loud braying of a mule. The latter noise brought back memory at once, and I sat up, sheet clutched to my bosom.

I was naked, and I was in the loft of Fergusâ€™s printshop. When we had left Kingsessing the day before, during a brief pause in the rain, we had found Fergus patiently sheltering in a toolshed near the gates, Clarence the mule and two horses tethered under its eaves.

â€œYou havenâ€™t been out here all this time!â€ Iâ€™d blurted upon seeing him.

â€œDid it take that long?â€ he inquired, cocking a dark brow at Jamie and giving him the sort of knowing look that Frenchmen appear to be born with.

â€œMmphm,â€ Jamie replied ambiguously, and took my arm. â€œI rode Clarence out, Sassenach, but I asked Fergus to come on a wee bit later wiâ€™ a horse for you. The mule canna carry us both, and my back willna stand walking that far.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with your back?â€ I asked, suspicious.

â€œNothing that a nightâ€™s sleep in a good bed willna cure,â€ he replied, and, stooping so I could put a foot in his hands, tossed me up into the saddle.

It had been past dark when we made it back to the printshop. Iâ€™d sent Germain at once to Jenny at Number 17 with word where I was but had gone to bed with Jamie before he came back. I wondered vaguely who else was at the house on Chestnut Street and what they were doing: was Hal still a captive, or had Young Ian decided to release him? If not, had Hal assassinated Denny Hunter, or had Mrs. Figg shot him?

Jamie had told me heâ€™d left Ian in charge of the situationâ€”or situations; there seemed to have been a great deal going on the day before. All of it seemed unreal and dreamlike, both the events Iâ€™d participated in and the ones Jamie had told me about on the ride back. The only vividly real recollection I had was of our conversation in the gardenâ€”and what followed it, in the potting shed. My flesh still felt the echoes.

Breakfast was plainly preparing below; besides the delectable scent of frying bacon, I could smell toasted yeast bread and fresh honey. My stomach gave a loud gurgle at this, and as though the sound had caused it, the ladder leading up into the loft began to shake. Someone was coming up, moving slowly, and in case it wasnâ€™t Jamie, I seized my shift and pulled it hastily over my head.

It wasnâ€™t. A pewter tray rose slowly into sight, laid with a plate piled with food, a bowl of porridge, and a pottery mug of something steaming; it couldnâ€™t be tea and didnâ€™t smell like coffee. As the tray levitated, Henri-Christianâ€™s beaming face appeared below it; he was balancing the thing on his head.

I held my breath until heâ€™d stepped off the ladder, and then, as he removed the tray from his head and presented it to me with a ceremonious little bow, applauded.

â€œMerveilleux!â€ I told him, and he grinned from ear to ear.

â€œFÃ©licitÃ© wanted to try,â€ he told me proudly, â€œbut she canâ€™t do it with a full tray yet. She spills.â€

â€œWell, we canâ€™t have that. Thank you, sweetheart.â€ I leaned forward to kiss himâ€”his dark wavy hair smelled of woodsmoke and inkâ€”and took the mug. â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€

He looked at it dubiously and shrugged. â€œItâ€™s hot.â€

â€œSo it is.â€ I cradled the mug in my hands. The loft had been warm the night before, the dayâ€™s heat trapped under the roof, but it had rained most of the night, and the chilly damp had come through the holes in the roofâ€”four or five vessels placed under the leaks made a symphony of plinking sounds. â€œWhereâ€™s Grand-pÃ¨re?â€

Henri-Christianâ€™s face at once went bright red, his lips pressed tight together, and he shook his head vigorously.

â€œWhat?â€ I said, surprised. â€œIs it a secret?â€

â€œDonâ€™t you tell her!â€ Joanieâ€™s shrill voice floated up from the shop below. â€œGrand-pÃ¨re said not to!â€

â€œOh, a surprise, is it?â€ I asked, smiling. â€œWell, perhaps youâ€™d best go down and help your mama, then, so you donâ€™t give it away by mistake.â€

He giggled, hands pressed over his mouth, then reached up over his head, gave a convulsive leap, and flipped over backward, landing adroitly on his hands. He walked on them to the ladder, stocky little legs splayed to keep his balance, and for an instant my heart was in my mouth as he reached the edge and I thought he might try to go down the ladder upside down. He flipped over again, though, landing neatly on the top rung, and scampered out of sight like a squirrel, giggling all the way down.

Smiling, I plumped up the sparse beddingâ€”we had slept on a flattened pallet of worn straw from the stable, which smelled rather strongly of Clarence, and on our half-dried cloaks, covered with a spare sheet and a ragged blanket, though Joanie and FÃ©licitÃ© had given us one of their feather pillows, they sharing the otherâ€”and sat back against the wall, the tray perched on a keg of ink powder. I was surrounded by stacks of paper, these shielded by oilcloth from the leaks. Some of it was blank reams awaiting the press, some of it pamphlets, circulars, posters, or the guts of unbound books, awaiting delivery to customers or to the bookbinder.



I could hear Marsaliâ€™s voice below, back in the living quarters behind the shop, raised in maternal command. No male voices but Henri-Christianâ€™s, though; Fergus and Germain must have gone out with Clarence the mule to make the morning deliveries of Lâ€™Oignon, the satirical newspaper started by Fergus and Marsali in North Carolina.

Normally, Lâ€™Oignon was a weekly paper, but there was a copy on my tray of the special edition for today, with a large cartoon on the first page, showing the British army as a horde of cockroaches, fleeing Philadelphia with tattered flags dragging behind them and trailing ribbon banners filled with speeches of futile threat. A large buckled shoe labeled General Washington was squashing some of the more laggard roaches.

There was a large glob of opaque yellow-white honey melting slowly in the middle of the porridge; I stirred it in, poured a bit of cream over it, and settled down to enjoy breakfast in bed, along with an article noting the imminent entrance into Philadelphia of General Arnold, who was taking office as the military governor of the city, welcoming him and praising his military record and gallant exploits at Saratoga.

How long? I thought then, setting down the paper with a small shiver. When? I had the feeling that it had beenâ€”would beâ€”much later in the war, when circumstance turned Benedict Arnold from patriot to traitor. But I didnâ€™t know.

It didnâ€™t matter, I told myself firmly. I couldnâ€™t change it. And long before that happened, we would be safely back on the Ridge, rebuilding our house and our lives. Jamie was alive. Everything would be all right.

The bell over the shop door below rang, and there was an excited gabble as the children stampeded out of the kitchen. The soft rumble of Jamieâ€™s voice floated up over the confusion of shrill greetings, and I caught Marsaliâ€™s voice among them, stunned.

â€œDa! What have ye done?â€

Alarmed, I scrambled out of my nest and went on hands and knees to the edge of the loft to look down. Jamie stood in the middle of the shop, surrounded by admiring children, his loose hair spangled with raindrops, cloak folded over his armâ€”dressed in the dark blue and buff of a Continental officer.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ!â€ I exclaimed. He looked up and his eyes met mine like those of a guilty puppy.

â€œIâ€™m sorry, Sassenach,â€ he said apologetically. â€œI had to.â€



HEâ€™D COME UP to the loft and pulled the ladder up behind him, to prevent the children coming up. I was dressing quicklyâ€”or trying toâ€”as he told me about Dan Morgan, about Washington and the other Continental generals. About the coming battle.

â€œSassenach, I had to,â€ he said again, softly. â€œIâ€™m that sorry.â€

â€œI know,â€ I said. â€œI know you did.â€ My lips were stiff. â€œIâ€”youâ€”Iâ€™m sorry, too.â€

I was trying to fasten the dozen tiny buttons that closed the bodice of my gown, but my hands shook so badly that I couldnâ€™t even grasp them. I stopped trying and dug my hairbrush out of the bag heâ€™d brought me from the Chestnut Street house.

He made a small sound in his throat and took it out of my hand. He threw it onto our makeshift couch and put his arms around me, holding me tight with my face buried in his chest. The cloth of his new uniform smelled of fresh indigo, walnut hulls, and fullerâ€™s earth; it felt strange and stiff against my face. I couldnâ€™t stop shaking.

â€œTalk to me, a nighean,â€ he whispered into my tangled hair. â€œIâ€™m afraid, and I dinna want to feel so verra much alone just now. Speak to me.â€

â€œWhy has it always got to be you?â€ I blurted into his chest.

That made him laugh, a little shakily, and I realized that all the trembling wasnâ€™t coming from me.

â€œItâ€™s no just me,â€ he said, and stroked my hair. â€œThere are a thousand other men readying themselves todayâ€”moreâ€”who dinna want to do it, either.â€

â€œI know,â€ I said again. My breathing was a little steadier. â€œI know.â€ I turned my face to the side in order to breathe, and all of a sudden began to cry, quite without warning.

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ I gasped. â€œI donâ€™t meanâ€”I donâ€™t want t-to make it h-harder for you. Iâ€”Iâ€”oh, Jamie, when I knew you were aliveâ€”I wanted so much to go home. To go home with you.â€

His arms tightened hard round me. He didnâ€™t speak, and I knew it was because he couldnâ€™t.

â€œSo did I,â€ he whispered at last. â€œAnd we will, a nighean. I promise ye.â€

The sounds from below floated up around us: the sounds of children running back and forth between the shop and the kitchen, Marsali singing to herself in Gaelic as she made fresh ink for the press from varnish and lamp-black. The door opened, and cool, rainy air blew in with Fergus and Germain, adding their voices to the cheerful confusion.

We stood wrapped in each otherâ€™s arms, taking comfort from our family below, yearning for the others we might never see again, at once at home and homeless, balanced on a knife edge of danger and uncertainty. But together.

â€œYouâ€™re not going off to war without me,â€ I said firmly, straightening up and sniffing. â€œDonâ€™t even think about it.â€

â€œI wouldna dream of it,â€ he assured me gravely, went to wipe his nose on his uniform sleeve, thought better of it, and stopped, looking at me helplessly. I laughedâ€”tremulous, but it was a laugh nonethelessâ€”and gave him the handkerchief Iâ€™d tucked automatically into my bosom when I fastened my stays. Like Jenny, I always had one.

â€œSit down,â€ I said, swallowing as I picked up the hairbrush. â€œIâ€™ll plait your hair for you.â€

Heâ€™d washed it this morning; it was clean and damp, the soft red strands cool in my hands and smellingâ€”oddlyâ€”of French soap, scented with bergamot. I rather missed the scent of sweat and cabbage that had surrounded me all night.

â€œWhere did you bathe?â€ I asked curiously.



â€œAt the house on Chestnut Street,â€ he answered, a little tersely. â€œMy sister made me. She said I couldna turn up to be a general smelling like a stale dinner, and there was a tub and hot water to spare.â€

â€œDid she?â€ I murmured. â€œUm . . . speaking of Chestnut Street . . . how is His Grace, the Duke of Pardloe?â€

â€œGone before dawn, Jenny said,â€ he said, bending his head to aid in the plaiting. His neck was warm under my fingers. â€œAccording to Ian, Denny Hunter said he was well enough to go, provided that he took along a flask of your magic potion. So Mrs. Figg gave him back his breechesâ€”wiâ€™ some reluctance, I understandâ€”and he went.â€

â€œWent where?â€ I asked. His hair was more heavily traced with silver than it had been. I didnâ€™t mind that; I minded that I hadnâ€™t been there to see it slowly change, day by day.

â€œIan didna ask him. But he said Mrs. Figg told the duke the names of some friends of Lord Johnâ€™sâ€”Loyalists that might be still in the city. And his sonâ€™s staying in a house here, no? Dinna be worrit on his account, Sassenach.â€ He turned his head to smile sideways at me. â€œHis Grace is a man whoâ€™s hard to kill.â€

â€œI suppose it takes one to know one,â€ I said tartly. I didnâ€™t ask why Jamie had gone to Chestnut Street; Hal, Jenny, and all other concerns notwithstanding, I knew he wanted to know whether John had reappeared. Apparently not, and a small chill frosted my heart.

I was groping in my pocket for a ribbon with which to club his queue, when a fresh draft swept through the loft, lifting the oilcloth and fluttering the papers beneath. I turned to see the source of the breeze and beheld Germain, swinging off the pulley rope to come in by the shuttered doors through which bales and kegs could be lowered from the loft to wagons below.

â€œBonjour, Grand-pÃ¨re,â€ he said, wiping a cobweb off his face as he landed and bowing to Jamie with great formality. He turned and bowed to me, as well. â€œComment Ã§a va, Grand-mÃ¨re?â€

â€œFiâ€”â€ I began automatically, but was interrupted by Jamie.

â€œNo,â€ he said definitely. â€œYeâ€™re not coming.â€

â€œPlease, Grandda!â€ Germainâ€™s formality disappeared in an instant, replaced by pleading. â€œI could be a help to ye!â€

â€œI know,â€ Jamie said dryly. â€œAnd your parents would never forgive me if ye were. I dinna even want to know what your notion of help involves, butâ€”â€

â€œI could carry messages! I can ride, ye ken that, ye taught me yourself! And Iâ€™m nearly twelve!â€

â€œYe ken how dangerous that is? If a British sharpshooter didna take ye out of the saddle, someone from the militia would club ye over the head to steal the horse. And I can count, ken? Yeâ€™re no even eleven yet, so dinna be tryinâ€™ it on with me.â€

Obviously, danger held no fears whatever for Germain. He shrugged, impatient.

â€œWell, I could be an orderly, then. I can find food anywhere,â€ he added, cunning. He was in fact a very accomplished scrounger, and I looked at him thoughtfully. Jamie intercepted my glance and glowered at me.



â€œDinna even think about it, Sassenach. Heâ€™d be taken up for theft and hanged or flogged within an inch of his life, and I couldna do a thing to stop it.â€

â€œNobodyâ€™s ever caught me!â€ Germain said, his professional pride outraged. â€œNot once!â€

â€œAnd theyâ€™re not going to,â€ his grandfather assured him, fixing him with a steely eye. â€œWhen yeâ€™re sixteen, maybeâ€”â€

â€œOh, aye? Grannie Janet says ye were eight when ye first went raiding with your da!â€

â€œLifting cattleâ€™s no the same as war, and I wasna anywhere near the fighting,â€ Jamie said. â€œAnd your Grannie Janet should keep her mouth shut.â€

â€œAye, Iâ€™ll tell her ye said so,â€ Germain retorted, disgruntled. â€œShe says ye got bashed on the head with a sword.â€

â€œI did. And with luck yeâ€™ll live to be an auld man with your brains unscrambled, unlike your grandsire. Leave us, lad, your grannie needs to put her stockings on.â€ He stood up and, lifting the ladder, slid it down from the loft and pushed Germain firmly onto it.

He stood looking sternly down until Germain had reached the floor below, marking his displeasure by skipping the last few rungs and landing with a loud thud.

Jamie sighed, straightened up, and stretched himself gingerly, groaning a little.

â€œGod knows where weâ€™ll sleep tonight, Sassenach,â€ he remarked, glancing at our rude couch as he sat down for me to finish clubbing his hair. â€œFor the sake of my back, I hope itâ€™s a bit softer than this.â€ He grinned at me suddenly. â€œDid ye sleep well?â€

â€œNever better,â€ I assured him, smoothing out the ribbon. In fact, I ached in almost every place it was possible to ache, save perhaps the top of my head. For that matter, Iâ€™d barely slept, and neither had he; weâ€™d passed the hours of darkness in slow and wordless exploration, finding again each otherâ€™s body . . . and, toward dawn, had touched each otherâ€™s soul again. I touched the back of his neck now, gently, and his hand rose to mine. I felt simultaneously wonderful and wretched, and didnâ€™t know from moment to moment which feeling was uppermost.

â€œWhen will we leave?â€

â€œAs soon as ye put your stockings on, Sassenach. And tidy your hair. And do up your buttons,â€ he added, turning and catching sight of my excessive dÃ©colletage. â€œHere, Iâ€™ll do that.â€

â€œIâ€™ll need my medicine box,â€ I said, going cross-eyed as I watched his nimble fingers flicking down my chest.

â€œI brought it,â€ he assured me, and frowned a bit, eyes intent on a recalcitrant button. â€œItâ€™s a bonny bit of furniture. I expect his lordship bought it for ye?â€

â€œHe did.â€ I hesitated a moment, rather wishing he had said â€œJohnâ€ rather than â€œhis lordship.â€ I also wished I knew where John wasâ€”and that he was all right. But this didnâ€™t seem the moment to say any of those things.

Jamie leaned forward and kissed the top of my breast, his breath warm on my skin.



â€œI dinna ken whether Iâ€™ll have a bed at all tonight,â€ he said, straightening up. â€œBut whether itâ€™s feathers or straw, promise yeâ€™ll share it with me?â€

â€œAlways,â€ I said, and, picking up my cloak, shook it out, swirled it round my shoulders, and smiled bravely at him. â€œLetâ€™s go, then.â€



JENNY HAD SENT my medicine chest from Chestnut Street and with it the large parcel of herbs from Kingsessing, which had been delivered there the night before. With the forethought of a Scottish housewife, sheâ€™d also included a pound of oatmeal, a twist of salt, a package of bacon, four apples, and six clean handkerchiefs. Also a neat roll of fabric with a brief note, which read:

Dear Sister Claire,

You appear to own nothing suitable in which to go to war. I suggest you borrow Marsaliâ€™s printing apron for the time being, and here are two of my flannel petticoats and the simplest things Mrs. Figg could find amongst your wardrobe.

Take care of my brother, and tell him his stockings need darning, because he wonâ€™t notice until heâ€™s worn holes in the heel and given himself blisters.

Your Good-sister,

Janet Murray

â€œAnd just how is it that you own something suitable in which to go to war?â€ I asked, eyeing Jamie in his indigo splendor. His uniform appeared to be complete, from coat with epaulets and a brigadier generalâ€™s insignia to buff waistcoat and cream silk stockings. Tall and straight, with auburn hair neatly clubbed and ribboned in black, he distinctly drew the eye.

He drew his chin back and looked down his nose at himself.

â€œWell, the sark and smallclothes were mine already; I had them when I came from Scotland. But when I came back to Philadelphia to find ye yesterday, I found Jenny first, and I told her about General Washington and asked her would she see to it. So she took my measurements and found a tailor and his son who do uniforms and browbeat them into working all night to make the coat and waistcoatâ€”poor wretches,â€ he added, gingerly pulling a loose thread from the edge of his cuff. â€œHow is it that ye donâ€™t, Sassenach? Did his lordship think it unseemly for ye to doctor folk and make ye burn your working clothes?â€

This was said with the sort of jesting tone thatâ€™s meant to suggest perfect innocence on the part of the speaker while making it perfectly apparent that malice is intended. â€œI donâ€™t say that Iâ€™ll no make a fuss about it later.â€ I looked pointedly at the medical chest John had given me, then back at him, narrowing my eyes ever so slightly.

â€œNo,â€ I said, with great casualness. â€œI spilled vitriol on them, makingâ€” making ether.â€ The memory made my hands shake slightly, and I had to set down the cup of nettle tea I was drinking.

â€œJesus, Sassenach.â€ Jamie spoke under his breathâ€”FÃ©licitÃ© and Joan were kneeling at his feet, arguing with each other as they busily burnished his brass shoe bucklesâ€”but he met my eyes over their heads, appalled. â€œTell me ye werena doing that drunk.â€

I took a deep breath, at once reliving the experience and trying not to. Standing in the hot, semi-dark shed behind the house, the rounded glass slick in my sweating hands . . . then the flying liquidâ€”it had barely missed my faceâ€”and the sickly smell and magically widening, smoking holes that burned straight through my heavy canvas apron and the skirt beneath. I hadnâ€™t really cared at the time whether I lived or diedâ€”until it looked as though I was going to die in the next few seconds. That made rather a difference. It hadnâ€™t convinced me not to commit suicideâ€”but the shock of the near accident did make me think more carefully about how. Slitting oneâ€™s wrists was one thing; dying in slow, disfiguring agony was another.

â€œNo, I wasnâ€™t,â€ I said, and, taking up the cup, managed a deliberate mouthful. â€œIâ€”it was a hot day. My hands were sweating, and the flask slipped.â€

He closed his eyes briefly, all too clearly envisioning the scene himself, then reached across FÃ©licitÃ©â€™s sleek dark head to cup my cheek.

â€œDinna be doing that again, aye?â€ he said softly. â€œDonâ€™t make it anymore.â€

To be honest, the thought of making ether again made my palms sweat. It wasnâ€™t chemically difficult, but it was terribly dangerous. One wrong move, a little too much vitriol, a few degrees of heat too much . . . And Jamie knew as well as I did just how explosive the stuff was. I could see the memory of flames in his eyes, the Big House going up around us. I swallowed.

â€œI donâ€™t want to,â€ I said honestly. â€œButâ€”without it, Jamie, I canâ€™t do things that I can do with it. If I hadnâ€™t had it, Aidan would be deadâ€”so would Johnâ€™s nephew Henry.â€

He compressed his lips and looked as though he considered that Henry Grey might be disposableâ€”but he was fond of little Aidan McCallum Higgins, whose appendix Iâ€™d removed on the Ridge with the assistance of my first batch of ether.

â€œGrannie has to help people feel better, Grand-pÃ¨re,â€ Joanie said reproachfully, rising from her spot at Jamieâ€™s feet and frowning up at him. â€œItâ€™s her callinâ€™, Mam says. She canâ€™t just not.â€

â€œI ken that fine,â€ he assured her. â€œBut she needna blow herself to kingdom come doing it. After all, whoâ€™s going to look after all the sick folk, if your grannieâ€™s lying about in pieces?â€

FÃ©licitÃ© and Joanie both thought that image hilarious; I was less amused, but didnâ€™t say anything further until theyâ€™d taken their rags and vinegar back to the kitchen. We were left in the sleeping part of the living quarters, assembling our bags and bundles for departure, and momentarily alone.

â€œYou said you were afraid,â€ I said quietly, eyes on the spools of coarse thread and twists of silk floss I was stowing in a wooden box with several suture needles. â€œBut that wonâ€™t stop you doing what you think you have to do, will it? Iâ€™m afraid for youâ€”and that certainly wonâ€™t stop you, either.â€ I was careful to speak without bitterness, but he was as sensitive to tones of voice this morning as I was.

He paused for a moment, regarding his shining shoe buckles, then lifted his head and looked at me straight.

â€œDo ye think that because yeâ€™ve told me the Rebels will win, I am free to walk away?â€

â€œIâ€”no.â€ I slid the box lid shut with a snick, not looking at it. I couldnâ€™t look away from him. His face was still, but his eyes held mine, intent. â€œI know you have to. I know itâ€™s part of what you are. You canâ€™t stand aside and still be what you are. That was more or less my point, aboutâ€”â€

He interrupted me, stepping forward and seizing me by the wrist.

â€œAnd what is it that ye think I am, Sassenach?â€

â€œA bloody man, thatâ€™s what!â€ I pulled loose and turned away, but he put a hand on my shoulder and turned me back to face him.

â€œAye, I am a bloody man,â€ he said, and the faintest trace of rue touched his mouth, but his eyes were blue and steady.

â€œYeâ€™ve made your peace with what I am, ye thinkâ€”but I think ye dinna ken what that means. To be what I am doesna mean only that Iâ€™ll spill my own blood when I must. It means I must sacrifice other men to the ends of my own causeâ€”not only those I kill as enemies, but those I hold as friends . . . or as kin.â€

His hand dropped away, and the tension left his shoulders. He turned toward the door, saying, â€œCome when yeâ€™re ready, Sassenach.â€



I STOOD THERE for an instant, blinking, then ran after him, leaving my half-packed bag behind.

â€œJamie!â€ He was standing in the printshop, Henri-Christian in his arms, bidding goodbye to the girls and Marsali. Germain was nowhere in sight, doubtless sulking. Jamie looked up, startled, then smiled at me.

â€œI wasna going to leave ye behind, Sassenach. And I didna mean to hurry ye, either. Do yeâ€”â€

â€œI know. I justâ€”I have to tell you something.â€

All the little heads turned toward me like a nestful of baby birds, soft pink mouths open in curiosity. It occurred to me that I might better have waited until we were on the road, but it had seemed urgent that I tell him nowâ€”not only to relieve his anxieties, but to make him know I did understand.

â€œItâ€™s William,â€ I blurted, and Jamieâ€™s face clouded for an instant, like a breathed-on mirror. Yes, I had understood.

â€œCome to me, a bhalaich,â€ Marsali said, taking Henri-Christian from Jamie and setting him on the floor. â€œOof! Ye weigh more than I do, wee man! Come away now, lassies, Grandda isnâ€™t going just yet. Help me fetch out Grannieâ€™s things.â€

The children obediently scampered off behind her, though still looking back at us in frustrated curiosity. Children hate secrets, unless theyâ€™re the ones keeping them. I glanced after them, then turned back to Jamie.



â€œI didnâ€™t know if they knew about William. I suppose Marsali and Fergus do, sinceâ€”â€

â€œSince Jenny told them. Aye, they do.â€ He rolled his eyes in brief resignation, then fixed them on my face. â€œWhat is it, Sassenach?â€

â€œHe canâ€™t fight,â€ I said, letting out a half-held breath. â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter what the British army is about to do. William was paroled after Saratogaâ€”heâ€™s a conventioner. You know about the Convention army?â€

â€œI do.â€ He took my hand and squeezed it. â€œYe mean heâ€™s not allowed to take up arms unless heâ€™s been exchangedâ€”and he hasnâ€™t been, is that it?â€

â€œThatâ€™s it. Nobody can be exchanged, until the King and the Congress come to some agreement about it.â€

His face was suddenly vivid with relief, and I was relieved to see it.

â€œJohnâ€™s been trying to have him exchanged for months, but there isnâ€™t any way of doing it.â€ I dismissed Congress and the King with a wave of my free hand and smiled up at him. â€œYou wonâ€™t have to face him on a battlefield.â€

â€œTaing do Dhia,â€ he said, closing his eyes for an instant. â€œIâ€™ve been thinking for daysâ€”when I wasna fretting about you, Sassenachâ€”â€ he added, opening his eyes and looking down his nose at me, â€œâ€”the third timeâ€™s the charm. And that would be an evil charm indeed.â€

â€œThird time?â€ I said. â€œWhat do youâ€”would you let go my fingers? Theyâ€™ve gone numb.â€

â€œOh,â€ he said. He kissed them gently and let go. â€œAye, sorry, Sassenach. I meantâ€”Iâ€™ve shot at the lad twice in his life so far and missed him by no more than an inch each time. If it should happen againâ€”ye canna always tell, in battle, and accidents do happen. I was dreaming, during the night, and . . . och, nay matter.â€ He waved off the dreams and turned away, but I put a hand on his arm to stop him. I knew his dreamsâ€”and Iâ€™d heard him moan the night before, fighting them.

â€œCulloden?â€ I said softly. â€œHas it come back again?â€ I actually hoped it was Cullodenâ€”and not Wentworth. He woke from the Wentworth dreams sweating and rigid and couldnâ€™t bear to be touched. Last night, he hadnâ€™t waked, but had jerked and moaned until Iâ€™d got my arms around him and he quieted, trembling in his sleep, head butted hard into my chest.

He shrugged a little and touched my face.

â€œItâ€™s never left, Sassenach,â€ he said, just as softly. â€œIt never will. But I sleep easier by your side.â€





JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT

IT WAS A PERFECTLY ordinary red-brick building. Modestâ€”no pediments, no carved stone lintelsâ€”but solid. Ian looked at it warily. The home of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, the weightiest meeting of the Society of Friends in the Americas. Aye, very solid.

â€œWill this be like the Vatican?â€ he asked Rachel. â€œOr more like an archbishopâ€™s palace?â€

She snorted.

â€œDoes it look like any sort of palace to thee?â€ She spoke normally, but he could see the pulse beat quick in the soft spot just beneath her ear.

â€œIt looks like a bank,â€ he said, and that made her laugh. She cut it short, though, glancing over her shoulder as though afraid someone might come out and scold her for it.

â€œWhat do they do in there?â€ he asked, curious. â€œIs it a great meetinghouse?â€

â€œIt is,â€ she said. â€œBut there is also business to be done, thee knows. The yearly meetings deal with matters of . . . I suppose thee would call it principle. We call it Faith and Practice; there are books, rewritten every so often, to reflect the present sense of the meeting. And queries.â€ She smiled suddenly, and his heart gave a small extra thump. â€œI think thee would recognize the queriesâ€”theyâ€™re much like thee has described the examination of conscience before thy confession.â€

â€œOch, aye,â€ he said agreeably, but declined to pursue the subject. He hadnâ€™t been to confession in some years and didnâ€™t feel sufficiently wicked at present to trouble about it. â€œThis Faith and Practiceâ€”is that where they say ye mustnâ€™t join the Continental army, even if ye dinna take up arms?â€

He was immediately sorry heâ€™d asked; the question dimmed the light in her eyes, but only momentarily. She drew a deep breath through her nose and looked up at him.

â€œNo, that would be an opinionâ€”a formal opinion. Friends talk over every possible point of consideration before they give an opinionâ€”whether itâ€™s a positive one or not.â€ There was the barest hesitation before â€œnot,â€ but he heard it and, reaching out, pulled out her hatpin, gently straightened her straw hat, which had slid a little askew, and pushed the pin back in.

â€œAnd if in the end itâ€™s not, and we canna find a meeting that will have us, lassâ€”what will we do?â€

Her lips pressed together, but she met his eyes straight on.

â€œFriends are not married by their meeting. Or by priest or preacher. They marry each other. And we will marry each other.â€ She swallowed. â€œSomehow.â€

The small bubbles of misgiving that had been rising through his wame all morning began to pop, and he put a hand over his mouth to stifle a belch. Being nervous took him in the innards; heâ€™d not been able to eat breakfast. He turned a little away, from politeness, and spied two figures coming round the far corner. â€œOch! Thereâ€™s your brother now, and lookinâ€™ gey fine for a Quaker, too.â€

Denzell was dressed in the uniform of a Continental soldier and looked self-conscious as a hunting dog with a bow tied round its neck. Ian suppressed his amusement, though, merely nodding as his future brother-in-law drew to a stop before them. Dennyâ€™s betrothed had no such compunctions.

â€œIs he not beautiful?â€ Dottie crowed, standing back a little to admire him. Denzell coughed and pushed his spectacles up his nose. He was a tidy man, not over-tall, but broad in the shoulder and strong in the forearm. He did look fine in the uniform, Ian thought, and said so.

â€œI will try not to let my appearance engorge my vanity,â€ Denzell said dryly. â€œIs thee not also to be a soldier, Ian?â€

Ian shook his head, smiling.

â€œNay, Denny. I shouldna be any kind of soldierâ€”but Iâ€™m a decent scout.â€ He saw Denzellâ€™s eyes fix on his face, tracing the double line of tattooed dots that looped across both cheekbones.

â€œI expect thee would be.â€ A certain tenseness in Dennyâ€™s shoulders relaxed. â€œScouts are not required to kill the enemy, are they?â€

â€œNo, weâ€™ve our choice about it,â€ Ian assured him, straight-faced. â€œWe can kill them if we likeâ€”but just for the fun of it, ken. It doesna really count.â€

Denzell blinked for an instant at that, but Rachel and Dottie both laughed, and he reluctantly smiled.

â€œThee is late, Denny,â€ Rachel said, as the public clock struck ten. â€œWas Henry in difficulty?â€ For Denzell and Dottie had gone to take farewell of Dottieâ€™s brother, Henry, still convalescent from the surgery Denny and Ianâ€™s auntie Claire had done.

â€œThee might say so,â€ Dottie said, â€œbut not from any physical ill.â€ The look of amusement faded from her face, though a faint gleam still lingered in her eyes. â€œHe is in love with Mercy Woodcock.â€

â€œHis landlady? Loveâ€™s no usually a fatal condition, is it?â€ Ian asked, raising one brow.

â€œNot if thy name is neither Montague nor Capulet,â€ Denny said. â€œThe difficulty is that while Mercy loves him in return, she may or may not still have a husband living.â€

â€œAnd until she finds out heâ€™s dead . . .â€ Dottie added, lifting one slim shoulder.

â€œOr alive,â€ Denny said, giving her a look. â€œThere is always the possibility.â€

â€œNot much of one,â€ Dottie replied bluntly. â€œAuntieâ€”I mean Friendâ€”Claire doctored a man called Walter Woodcock whoâ€™d been badly wounded at Ticonderoga, and she said he was near death then and taken p-prisoner.â€ She stumbled slightly on the last word, and Ian was reminded suddenly that her eldest brother, Benjamin, was a prisoner of war.



Denzell saw the cloud cross her face and gently took her hand in his.

â€œBoth thy brothers will survive their trials,â€ he said, and warmth touched his eyes behind the glass. â€œSo will we, Dorothea. Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten themâ€”but not for love.â€

â€œHmph!â€ said Dottie, but gave him a small, grudging smile. â€œAll right, thenâ€”go ahead. Thereâ€™s such a lot to do before we go.â€

To Ianâ€™s surprise, Denzell nodded, took a folded sheaf of papers from his bosom, and, turning, went up the step to the door of the meetinghouse.

Ian had supposed the place was only a convenient spot to meetâ€”he would be catching up his uncle and Auntie Claire on the road to Coryellâ€™s Ferry but had lingered to help with the loading, for Denny, Dottie, and Rachel were driving a wagon filled with medical suppliesâ€”but evidently Denny had business with Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.

Was he seeking advice in how to be married as a Quaker even while flouting their . . . what would you call it, edictâ€”no, Rachel had said it was an opinion, but a â€œweightyâ€ opinionâ€”regarding support of the rebellion?

â€œHeâ€™s giving them his witnessâ€”his testimony,â€ Dottie said matter-of-factly, seeing the puzzlement in Ianâ€™s face. â€œHe wrote it all out. Why he thinks itâ€™s right to do what heâ€™s doing. Heâ€™s going to give it to the clerk of the yearly meeting and request that his views be mentioned and discussed.â€

â€œDâ€™ye think they will?â€

â€œOh, yes,â€ Rachel said. â€œThey may disagree with him, but they wonâ€™t stifle him. And good luck to them if they thought to try,â€ she added, half under her breath. She pulled a handkerchief out of her bosom, very white against the soft brown of her skin, and patted tiny droplets of sweat away from her temples.

Ian felt a sudden and profound longing for her and glanced involuntarily toward the clock tower. Heâ€™d need to be on the road soon and hoped thereâ€™d be time for a precious hour alone with Rachel first.

Dorotheaâ€™s eyes were still fixed on the door through which Denny had passed.

â€œHe is so lovely,â€ she said softly, as though to herself. Then glanced self-consciously at Rachel. â€œHe felt badly for wearing his uniform to see Henry,â€ she said, a tone of apology in her voice. â€œBut the time was so short . . .â€

â€œWas thy brother upset?â€ Rachel asked sympathetically. Dottieâ€™s brows drew down.

â€œWell, he didnâ€™t like it,â€ she said frankly. â€œBut itâ€™s not as though he didnâ€™t know that weâ€™re Rebels; I told him some time ago.â€ Her expression relaxed a little. â€œAnd he is my brother. He wonâ€™t disown me.â€

Ian wondered whether the same was true of her father, but didnâ€™t ask. She hadnâ€™t mentioned the duke. He wasnâ€™t really attending to Dottieâ€™s family concerns, thoughâ€”his mind was busy with thought of the coming battle and all that needed to be done immediately. Ian caught Rachelâ€™s eye and smiled, and she smiled back, all worry melting from her face as she met his gaze.

He had concerns himself, certainly, annoyances and worries. At the bottom of his soul, though, was the solid weight of Rachelâ€™s love and what she had said, the words gleaming like a gold coin at the bottom of a murky well. â€œWe will marry each other.â€





UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE

AS JAMIE EXPLAINED to me on the way out of Philadelphia, the problem lay not in finding the British but in catching up to them with enough men and matÃ©riel to do some good.

â€œThey left with several hundred wagons and a verra large number of Loyalists who didna feel quite safe in Philadelphia. Clinton canna be protecting them and fighting at the same time. He must make all the speed he canâ€”which means he must travel by the most direct road.â€

â€œI suppose he canâ€™t very well be legging it cross-country,â€ I agreed. â€œHave youâ€”meaning General Washingtonâ€”got any idea how big a force he has?â€

He lifted one shoulder and waved off a large horsefly with his hat.

â€œMaybe ten thousand men. Maybe more. Fergus and Germain watched them assemble to march out, but ye ken itâ€™s not easy to judge numbers when theyâ€™re crawlinâ€™ out of the side streets and all.â€

â€œMmm. And . . . um . . . how many men do we have?â€ Saying â€œweâ€ gave me an odd sensation that rippled through my lower body. Something between tail-curling apprehension and an excitement that was startlingly close to sexual.

It wasnâ€™t that Iâ€™d never felt the strange euphoria of war before. But it had been a very long time; Iâ€™d forgotten.

â€œFewer than the British,â€ Jamie said, matter-of-fact. â€œBut we willna ken how many until the militia have gatheredâ€”and pray itâ€™s not too late when we do.â€

He glanced aside at me, and I could see him wondering whether to say something further. He didnâ€™t speak, though, just gave a little shrug and settled himself in the saddle, putting on his hat again.

â€œWhat?â€ I said, tilting my head to peer up at him from under the brim of my own broad straw. â€œYou were about to ask me something.â€

â€œMmphm. Aye, well . . . I was, but then I realized that if ye did know anything about . . . what might happen in the next few days, yeâ€™d surely have told me.â€

â€œI would.â€ In fact, I didnâ€™t know whether to regret my lack of knowledge or not. Looking back at those instances where Iâ€™d thought I knew the future, I hadnâ€™t known nearly enough. Out of nowhere, I thought of Frank . . . and Black Jack Randall, and my hands gripped the reins so strongly that my mare jerked her head with a startled snort.

Jamie looked round, startled, too, but I waved a hand and leaned forward to pat the horseâ€™s neck in apology.



â€œHorsefly,â€ I said, in explanation. My heart was thumping noticeably against the placket of my stays, but I took several deep breaths to quiet it. I wasnâ€™t about to mention my sudden thought to Jamie, but it hadnâ€™t left me.

Iâ€™d thought I knew that Jack Randall was Frankâ€™s five-times-great-grandfather. His name was right there, on the genealogical chart that Frank had shown me many times. And, in fact, he was Frankâ€™s ancestorâ€”on paper. It was Jackâ€™s younger brother, though, who had sired Frankâ€™s bloodline but then had died before being able to marry his pregnant lover. Jack had married Mary Hawkins at his brotherâ€™s request and thus given his name and legitimacy to her child.

So many gory details didnâ€™t show up on those tidy genealogical charts, I thought. Brianna was Frankâ€™s daughter, on paperâ€”and by love. But the long, knife-blade nose and glowing hair of the man beside me showed whose blood ran through her veins.

But Iâ€™d thought I knew. And because of that false knowledge, Iâ€™d prevented Jamie killing Jack Randall in Paris, fearing that if he did, Frank might never be born. What if he had killed Randall then? I wondered, looking at Jamie sidelong. He sat tall, straight in the saddle, deep in thought, but with an air now of anticipation; the dread of the morning that had gripped us both had gone.

Anything might have happened; a number of things might not. Randall wouldnâ€™t have abused Fergus; Jamie wouldnâ€™t have fought a duel with him in the Bois de Boulogne . . . perhaps I would not have miscarried our first child, our daughter Faith. Likely I would haveâ€”miscarriage was usually physiological in basis, not emotional, however romantic novels painted it. But the memory of loss was forever linked to that duel in the Bois de Boulogne.

I shoved the memories firmly aside, turning my mind away from the half-known past to the complete mystery of the waiting future. But just before the images blinked out, I caught the edge of a flying thought.

What about the child? The child born to Mary Hawkins and Alexander Randallâ€”Frankâ€™s true ancestor. He was, in all probability, alive now. Right now.

The ripple Iâ€™d experienced before came back, this time running from my tailbone up my spine. Denys. The name floated up from the parchment of a genealogical chart, calligraphic letters that purported to capture a fact, while hiding nearly everything.

I knew his name was Denysâ€”and he was, so far as I knew, actually Frankâ€™s four-times great-grandfather. And that was all I knewâ€”likely all I ever would know. I fervently hoped so. I wished Denys Randall silently well and turned my mind to other things.





THE GOOD SHEPHERD

TWELVE. BLOODY. MILES! The train of baggage wagons stretched as far as the eye could see in either direction and raised a cloud of dust that nearly obscured the mules negotiating a bend in the road a half mile away. The people trudging beside the wagons on either side were coated with the fine brown stuffâ€”and so was William, though he kept as much distance as he could from the slow-moving cavalcade.

It was mid-afternoon of a hot day, and theyâ€™d been on the march since before dawn.

He paused to slap dust from the skirts of his coat and take a mouthful of tin-tasting water from his canteen. Hundreds of refugees, thousands of camp followers, all with packs and bundles and handcarts, with here and there a laden horse or mule that had somehow escaped the army teamstersâ€™ rapacity, were strung over the twelve miles between the two main bodies of the army. They spread out in a straggling mass that reminded him of the plague of locusts from the Bible. Was that the book of Exodus? Couldnâ€™t recall, but it seemed apposite.

Some of them looked over their shoulders now and then. He wondered if it was fear of pursuit or thoughts of what theyâ€™d left behindâ€”the city itself was long out of sight.

Well, if there was any danger of turning to a pillar of salt, it would be owing to sweat, not yearning, he thought, wiping his sleeve across his face for the dozenth time. He was himself eager to shake the dust of Philadelphia from his boots and never think of it again.

If it werenâ€™t for Arabellaâ€“Jane, heâ€™d likely have forgotten it already. He certainly wanted to forget everything else that had happened in the last few days. He twitched his reins and nudged his horse back toward the trudging horde.

It could be worse; nearly had been much worse. Heâ€™d come close to being dispatched back to England or sent north to join the other conventioners in Massachusetts. Thank Christ that Papaâ€”that is, Lord John, he corrected himself firmlyâ€”had made him learn German, along with French, Italian, Latin, and Greek. Besides the divisions commanded by Sir Henry and Lord Cornwallis, the army included a huge body of mercenary troops under General von Knyphausenâ€”nearly all of them from Hesse-Kassel, whose dialect William could manage with no trouble.

It had still taken a good deal of persuasion, but in the end heâ€™d landed up as one of Clintonâ€™s dozen aides-de-camp, charged with the tedious chore of riding up and down the ponderously moving column, collecting reports, delivering dispatches, and dealing with any small difficulties that developed en routeâ€”a more or less hourly occurrence. He kept a running mental note of where the various surgeons and hospital orderlies were; he lived in horror of having to attend the delivery of one of the camp followersâ€™ babiesâ€”there were at least fifty very pregnant women with the column.

Maybe it was the proximity of these ladies, gravid and pale, their swollen bellies borne like burdens, balanced with the ones on their backs, that made him think of . . .

Surely whores knew how to avoid pregnancy? He didnâ€™t recall Arabellaâ€“Jane doing anything . . . but he wouldnâ€™t have noticed, drunk as he was.

William thought of her whenever he touched the spot on his breast where his gorget should be. If asked, he would have said he put the thing on with his uniform and forgot about itâ€”but from the number of times he found Arabellaâ€“Jane in his mind, he was apparently in the habit of fiddling with it constantly.

The loss of the gorget had cost him an unpleasant five-minute analysis of his character, dress, hygiene, and personal failings from Clintonâ€™s chief aide, Captain Duncan Drummond, and a ten-shilling fine for being out of proper uniform. He didnâ€™t grudge her the cost.

He did find himself keeping an eye out for Captain Harkness. He couldnâ€™t recall enough of their encounter to have any idea of Harknessâ€™s regiment, but there werenâ€™t that many dragoon companies with the present army. He was working his way back along the column now, doing his daily round on Visigoth, a big bay gelding with good wind. The horse wasnâ€™t pleased with the slow pace and kept twitching under him, wanting to break into a gallop, but William held him to a steady trot, nodding as he passed each company, looking to the corporals and sergeants to see if any were in difficulty or needed assistance.

â€œWaterâ€™s coming!â€ he called to a particularly wilted-looking group of Loyalist refugees who had stopped on the verge of the road, taking pause in the scant shade provided by a scatter of oak saplings and a handcart precariously piled with their belongings.

This reassurance made the women look up hopefully from under their bonnets, and the gentleman rose to his feet, waving William down.

He reined in and recognized Mr. Endicott, a well-to-do Philadelphia merchant, and his family. Heâ€™d been to dinner at their house and had danced with the two older Misses Endicott at several parties.

â€œYour servant, sir,â€ he said, sweeping off his hat with a bow and nodding in turn to the ladies. â€œAnd yours, Mrs. Endicott. Miss Endicott, Miss Sally . . . and your most humble and obedient, Miss Peggy.â€ Miss Peggy Endicott, aged nine, went pink as a young strawberry at being singled out, and her elder sisters exchanged raised brows over her head.

â€œIs it true, Lord Ellesmere,â€ Endicott said, â€œthat we are closely pursued by the Rebels?â€ He was holding a large red-flannel handkerchief, with which he wiped a perspiring round face. â€œThe . . . er . . . the ladies find themselves summat worried by the prospect.â€

â€œThe ladies have no cause for concern, sir,â€ William assured him. â€œYou are under the protection of His Majestyâ€™s army, you know.â€



â€œWell, yes, we do know that,â€ Mr. Endicott said, rather testily. â€œOr so we hope, at least; certainly wouldnâ€™t be here else, I can tell you. But have you any news of Washingtonâ€™s whereabouts, is what Iâ€™d like to know?â€

Visigoth shifted his weight and danced a little, eager to be off, but William pulled his head round, clicking his tongue in rebuke.

â€œWhy, yes, sir,â€ he said respectfully. â€œWe have had several deserters from the Rebel camp, come in last night. They say that Washington is gathering his troops, no doubt in hopes of catching up to usâ€”but he has no more than two thousand regulars, with a few scrubby militia companies.â€

Mr. Endicott looked somewhat reassured at this, but the girls and their mother didnâ€™t. Mrs. Endicott plucked at her husbandâ€™s sleeve and murmured something. He flushed more deeply.

â€œI said Iâ€™ll deal with it, madam!â€ he snapped. He had taken off his wig because of the heat and wore a spotted silk handkerchief tied over his head against the sun; his grizzled hair was cropped short, and tiny bristles stuck out from the edge of the kerchief like the feelers of angry insects.

Mrs. Endicottâ€™s lips pressed tight, but she stepped back, jerking her head in a small nod. Miss Peggy, though, emboldened by Captain Ellesmereâ€™s particularity, scampered forward and seized hold of his stirrup. Visigoth, startled by the flying scrap of calico at the corner of his vision, shied violently; Peggy shrieked, stumbled back, and went flying. All of the Endicott ladies were shrieking, but William could do nothing about that; he fought the horseâ€™s head round and held on grimly while Goth crow-hopped and whirled, then settled down gradually, snorting and jerking at the bit. He could hear passing infantrymen being profanely amused as their column swerved to go round him.

â€œIs Miss Peggy quite all right?â€ he inquired, breathing heavily as he finally brought the horse back to the verge. Miss Anne Endicott was standing near the edge of the road, waiting for him; the rest of her family had retreated, and he heard a loud howling coming from behind the handcart.

â€œAside from being spanked by Papa for nearly being killed, yes,â€ Miss Endicott replied, looking amused. She drew a little closer, keeping a wary eye on Goth, but the horse was calm enough now, stretching his neck to grab a mouthful of grass.

â€œIâ€™m sorry to have been the cause of her distress,â€ William said politely, and groped in his pocket, coming out with nothing but a crumpled handkerchief and a stray sixpence. He handed the coin down to Anne, smiling. â€œGive her that, will you, with my apologies?â€

â€œShe will be fine,â€ Anne said, but took the coin. She glanced over her shoulder, then drew a step closer and spoke rapidly, lowering her voice. â€œI . . . hesitate to ask, Lord Ellesmere . . . but, you see, the cart has broken a wheel, my father cannot fix it, he wonâ€™t abandon our belongingsâ€”and my mother is terrified that we will be overtaken and captured by Washingtonâ€™s men.â€ Her dark eyesâ€”very fine dark eyesâ€”fixed on his with a brilliant intensity. â€œCan you help? Please? That was what my little sister meant to ask you.â€

â€œOh. What exactly is the trouble withâ€”never mind. Let me have a look.â€ It would do Goth no harm to settle for a few minutes. He swung down and tied the horse to one of the saplings, then followed Miss Endicott to the handcart.

It was overflowing with the same higgledy-piggledy assortment of goods heâ€™d seen on the docks two days agoâ€”a tall clock stuck out of heaped clothing and linens, and a homely earthenware chamber pot was stuffed with handkerchiefs, stockings, and what was probably Mrs. Endicottâ€™s jewel case. The sight of this particular mess gave him a sudden pang, though.

These were remnants of a real home, one heâ€™d been a guest inâ€”the rubbish and treasures of people he knew . . . and liked. Heâ€™d heard that very clock, with its pierced-work crown, strike midnight just before heâ€™d stolen a kiss from Anne Endicott in the shadows of her fatherâ€™s hallway. He felt the mellow bong, bong now, deep in his vitals.

â€œWhere will you go?â€ he asked quietly, a hand on her arm. She turned to him, flushed and harried, her dark hair coming out of her capâ€”but still with dignity.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ she said, just as quietly. â€œMy aunt Platt lives in a small village near New York, but I donâ€™t know that we can travel so far, as we are . . .â€ She nodded at the unwieldy cart, surrounded by bags and half-wrapped bundles. â€œPerhaps we can find a safe place closer and wait there while my father goes to make . . . arrangements.â€ Her lips pressed suddenly tight, and he realized that she was holding on to her composure by dint of great effort. And that it was unshed tears that made her eyes so bright. He took her hand and kissed it, gently.

â€œIâ€™ll help,â€ he said.

Easier said than done. While the axle of the cart was intact, one wheel had struck a jagged rock and not merely popped off but had in the process lost the flat-iron tire that encircled the felloesâ€”which in consequence had come apart, being badly glued. The wheel lay in pieces in the grass, and a gaudy orange-and-black butterfly perched on the disjunct hub, lazily fanning its wings.

Mrs. Endicottâ€™s fears werenâ€™t unfounded. Neither was Mr. Endicottâ€™s anxietyâ€”which he was attempting with little success to disguise as irritability. If they were stranded for too long, and left behind . . . even if Washingtonâ€™s regular troops were moving too fast for looting, there were always scavengers on the outskirts of an armyâ€”any army.

A respectful period of inspection allowed Mr. Endicott, still red-faced but more settled, to emerge from his domestic imbroglio, followed by Peggy, also red-faced and downcast. William nodded to the merchant and gestured, summoning him to join in contemplation of the wreckage, out of hearing of the women.

â€œAre you armed, sir?â€ William asked quietly. Endicottâ€™s face paled noticeably, and his Adamâ€™s apple bobbed above his dirt-grimed stock.

â€œI have a fowling piece that belonged to my father,â€ he said, in a voice so low as to be scarcely audible. â€œIâ€”itâ€™sâ€”not been fired in twenty years.â€ God, William thought, appalled. William felt himself naked and edgy without weapons. Endicott had to be fifty, at least, and alone here with four women to protect?



â€œIâ€™ll find you help, sir,â€ William said firmly. Mr. Endicott drew a deep, deep breath. William thought the man might sob if obliged to speak, and turned without haste toward the women, talking as he went.

â€œThere will be a cooper or wainwright somewhere along the column. Ah, and hereâ€™s the water carrier coming!â€ He extended a hand to Peggy. â€œWill you come with me to catch him, Miss Margaret? Iâ€™m sure heâ€™ll stop for a pretty face.â€ She didnâ€™t smile, but she sniffed, wiped her nose on her sleeve, drew herself up, and took his hand. The Endicott ladies were nothing if not courageous.

A bored-looking mule pulled a cart with several barrels of water, passing slowly down the column, the driver pausing when hailed. William waded determinedly into the fray, lifting Peggy in his arms for safetyâ€”to her evident delightâ€”and deflected the carrier to the Endicottsâ€™ service. Then, with a sweep of his hat to the ladies, he mounted again and made his way down the road in search of a cooper.

The army traveled with the equivalent of several villagesâ€™ worth of artisans and those men called â€œsupportivesâ€: coopers, carpenters, cooks, smiths, farriers, wainwrights, drovers, hauliers, orderlies. To say nothing of the vast swarm of laundresses and sempstresses among the camp followers. It wouldnâ€™t take long to find a cooper or a wainwright and persuade him to deal with the Endicottsâ€™ trouble. William glanced at the sun; nearly three.

The army was proceeding briskly, but that didnâ€™t mean it was moving at any great rate of speed. Clinton had given orders to march an additional two hours per day, though, a strain in the increasing heat. Another two hours before they made camp; with luck, the Endicotts might be whole again by then and able to keep up tomorrow.

A rumble of hooves and catcalls from the infantry caught his attention and made him glance over his shoulder, heart speeding up. Dragoons, plumes fluttering. He reined up and rode Goth straight at them, glancing from face to face as he passed down their double line. Several of them stared at him, and an officer made irritated motions at him, but he ignored that. A small voice in the back of his mind inquired what he meant to do if he found Harkness among them, but he ignored that, too.

He passed the end of the company, circled to the rear, and rode up the other side of the column, looking back over his shoulder at the rank of puzzled faces staring at him, some affronted, some amused. No . . . no . . . no . . . maybe? Would he even recognize the fellow? he wondered. Heâ€™d been very drunk. Still, he thought Harkness would recognize him. . . .

They were all staring at him by this time, but none with an aspect either of alarm or violence. Their colonel reined up a little and called to him.

â€œHo, Ellesmere! Lost something, have you?â€

He squinted against the sun and made out the vivid face of Ban Tarleton, red-cheeked and grinning under his flamboyant plumed helmet. He jerked his chin up in invitation, and William wheeled his horse and fell in beside him.

â€œNot lost, exactly,â€ he said. â€œJust looking for a dragoon I met in Philadelphiaâ€”named Harkness; you know him?â€

Ban pulled a face.



â€œYes. Heâ€™s with the Twenty-sixth. Randy bugger, always after women.â€

â€œAnd you arenâ€™t?â€ Ban wasnâ€™t a close friend, but William had been out on the randan with him once or twice in London. He didnâ€™t drink much, but he didnâ€™t need to; he was the sort of man who always seemed a little intoxicated.

Tarleton laughed, face flushed with the heat and red-lipped as a girl.

â€œYes. But Harkness doesnâ€™t care about anything but women. Known him to have three at once, in a brothel.â€

William considered that one for a moment.

â€œAll right. I can see a use for two, maybe . . . but whatâ€™s the third one for?â€

Ban, who was maybe four years older than William, gave him the sort of pitying look reserved for virgins and confirmed bachelors, then ducked back, laughing, when William punched him in the arm.

â€œRight,â€ William said. â€œThat aside, Iâ€™m looking for a wainwright or a cooper. Any close by?â€

Tarleton straightened his helmet and shook his head.

â€œNo, but thereâ€™s bound to be one or two in that mess.â€ He gestured negligently at the train of baggage wagons. â€œWhich regiment are you with, these days?â€ He frowned at William, seeming to realize that something was amiss with his dress. â€œWhereâ€™s your sword? And your gorget?â€

William gritted his teethâ€”and they really did grit, there being so much coarse dust in the airâ€”and apprised Tarleton of his situation in the minimum number of words. He didnâ€™t mention where or under what circumstances he had lost his gorget, and with a brief salute of farewell to the colonel, reined round and went down the column again. He was breathing as though heâ€™d run the length of London Bridge, and pulses of electricity were running down his arms and legs, jolting at the base of his spine.

His anger over his situation had been rekindled by his conversation with Tarleton andâ€”unable to do any bloody thing about any of itâ€”turned his mind to what he wanted to do to Harkness, should he meet the 26th Light Dragoons. He touched his chest by reflex, and his sudden urge to do violence changed at once to an equally sudden rush of desire that made him light-headed.

Then he recalled his original errand, and hot blood washed through his face. He rode more slowly, calming his mind. Harkness could wait. The Endicotts couldnâ€™t.

Thought of the family pained himâ€”and not only because he was ashamed of letting himself be distracted from their difficulty. But in recollecting them now, he realized that for those few moments with the Endicotts, concerned with their troubles, heâ€™d forgotten. Forgotten the burden heâ€™d been carrying like a pound of lead in his chest. Forgotten who he really was.

What would Anne Endicott have done, if she knew? Her parents? Even . . . well, no. He smiled, despite his disquiet. He didnâ€™t think Peggy Endicott would mind if he told her he was secretly a cutpurse or a cannibal, let alone aâ€”

Everyone else he knew, though . . . The Endicotts were only one Loyalist family whoâ€™d welcomed him into their home, and heâ€™d not taken proper leave of any of those who chose to stay in Philadelphia, too ashamed to see them, knowing the truth.



He looked back over his shoulder; the Endicotts were barely visible, now sitting in the grass in a companionable circle, sharing food of some kind. He felt a keen pang at the sight of their companionability. Heâ€™d never be part of a decent family, couldnâ€™t ever marry a woman even of such modest origins as Anne Endicott.

Her father might well be ruined, might have lost his wealth and business, the family might descend into povertyâ€”but they would remain who they were, firm in their courage and the pride of their name. Not him. His name didnâ€™t belong to him.

Well . . . he could marry, he grudgingly admitted to himself, making his way gingerly through a group of camp followers. But only a woman who wanted nothing but his title and money would have him, and to wed under such circumstances, knowing that your wife despised you . . . and to know that you passed the taint of your blood to your sons . . .

This morbid train of thought stopped abruptly with the appearance of a small group of artisans, trudging beside a large wagon that undoubtedly held their tools.

He came down on them like a wolf on a flock of startled sheep and ruthlessly cut out a fine, fat wainwright, whom he persuaded by threats and bribery to mount behind him and thus carried his prey back to the Endicotts.

With his spirit soothed by their gratitude, he turned northward again, toward the head of the army, camp, and his supper. Absorbed in thoughts of roast chicken and gravyâ€”he ate with Clintonâ€™s staff, and thus ate very wellâ€”he didnâ€™t notice at once that another horseman had come up alongside him, matching his pace.

â€œPenny for your thoughts?â€ said a pleasant, half-familiar voice, and he turned to find himself looking into the smiling face of Denys Randall-Isaacs.



WILLIAM REGARDED Randall-Isaacs with something between annoyance and curiosity. The man had to all effects abandoned him in Quebec City a year and a half before and vanished, leaving him to spend the winter snowbound with nuns and voyageurs. The experience had improved both his French and his hunting abilities, but not his temper.

â€œCaptain Randall-Isaacs,â€ he said in acknowledgment, rather coldly. The captain smiled sunnily at him, not at all put off by his tone.

â€œOh, just Randall these days,â€ he said. â€œMy fatherâ€™s name, you know. The other bit was a courtesy to my stepfather, but as the old manâ€™s passed on now . . .â€ He lifted one shoulder, leaving William to draw the obvious conclusion: that a Jewish-sounding surname couldnâ€™t be an asset to an ambitious officer.

â€œSurprised to see you here,â€ Randall went on, chummy, as though theyâ€™d seen each other at a ball last month. â€œYou were at Saratoga with Burgoyne, werenâ€™t you?â€

Williamâ€™s hand tightened on the reins, but he patiently explained his peculiar status. For possibly the twentieth time.

Randall nodded, respectful.



â€œCertainly better than cutting hay in Massachusetts,â€ he said, with a glance at the marching columns they were passing. â€œThought of going back to England, though?â€

â€œNo,â€ William said, somewhat startled. â€œWhy? For one thing, I doubt I can, by the terms of parole. For anotherâ€”why should I?â€ Why, indeed? he thought, with a fresh stab. Heâ€™d not even begun to think about what awaited him in England, at Helwater, at Ellesmere. In London, for that matter . . . oh, Jesus . . .

â€œWhy, indeed?â€ Randall said, unconsciously echoing him. The man sounded thoughtful. â€œWell . . . not much opportunity for distinguishing yourself here, is there?â€ He glanced very briefly at Williamâ€™s belt, bare of weapons, and away again directly, as though the sight was somehow shamefulâ€”which it was.

â€œAnd what is it you think I could do there?â€ William demanded, keeping his temper with some difficulty.

â€œWell, you are an earl,â€ Randall pointed out. William felt the blood rise up his neck, but couldnâ€™t say anything. â€œYou have a seat in the House of Lords. Why not use it to accomplish something? Take up politics. Doubt your parole says anything about thatâ€”and as long as you werenâ€™t going back to rejoin the army, I shouldnâ€™t think the travel itself would be a problem.â€

â€œIâ€™d never thought of it,â€ William said, striving for politeness. He couldnâ€™t think of anything heâ€™d less rather do than be politicalâ€”unless it was be political while acting a sham.

Randall tilted his head amiably to and fro, still smiling. He was much as heâ€™d been when William had seen him last: dark hair tied back without powder, good-looking rather than handsome, slender without being slight, graceful in movement, with a constant expression of sympathetic geniality. He hadnâ€™t changed muchâ€”but William had. He was two years older now, much more experienced, and was both surprised and a little gratified to discover that he realized that Randall was playing him like a hand of bezique. Or trying to.

â€œI suppose there are other possibilities,â€ he said, guiding his horse around an enormous puddle of muddy urine that had collected in a dip in the road.

Randallâ€™s horse had paused to add to it. Randall sat as composedly as one can in such a situation, but didnâ€™t try to raise his voice over the noise. He picked his way out of the mud and caught William up before continuing the conversation.

â€œPossibilities?â€ He sounded genuinely interested, and probably was, William thoughtâ€”but why? â€œWhat were you thinking of doing?â€

â€œYou recall Captain Richardson, of course?â€ William asked casually, but with an eye on Randallâ€™s face. One dark brow rose a bit, but otherwise he showed no particular emotion at hearing the name.

â€œOh, yes,â€ Randall replied, as casual as William. â€œHave you seen the good captain recently?â€

â€œYes, a couple of days ago.â€ Williamâ€™s temper had abated, and he waited with interest to see what Randall might have to say to this.

The captain didnâ€™t look taken aback, exactly, but his air of pleasant inconsequence had definitely sharpened into something else. William could actually see him wondering whether to ask bluntly what Richardson had wanted or to take another tack, and the perception gave him a small thrill.

â€œIs Lord John with Sir Henry?â€ Randall asked. That was enough of a non sequitur to make William blink, but there was no reason not to answer.

â€œNo. Why should he be?â€

The brow lifted again.

â€œYou didnâ€™t know? The Duke of Pardloeâ€™s regiment is in New York.â€

â€œIt is?â€ William was more than startled by that, but hastened to collect himself. â€œHow do you know?â€

Randall waved a well-manicured hand, as though the answer to this was irrelevantâ€”as perhaps it was.

â€œPardloe left Philadelphia this morning with Sir Henry,â€ he explained. â€œAs the duke has recalled Lord John to duty, I thoughtâ€”â€

â€œHe what?â€ Williamâ€™s horse jerked his head and snorted at the exclamation, and William stroked the big neck, using the gesture to avert his face for a moment. His father was here?

â€œI stopped at his lordshipâ€™s house in Philadelphia yesterday,â€ Randall explained, â€œand a rather odd Scotchwomanâ€”she must be his lordshipâ€™s housekeeper, I collect?â€”told me that his lordship had been gone for several days. But if you havenâ€™t seen him . . .â€

Randall raised his head, looking ahead. A haze of woodsmoke was already showing above the trees, cook fires, wash fires, and watch fires all marking the growing camp, their tang a pleasant spice in the nostrils. It made Williamâ€™s stomach growl.

â€œHup! Hup! At the double, quick . . . march!â€ A sergeantâ€™s bellow came from behind them, and they pulled aside for a double column of infantry, who hadnâ€™t needed the exhortation; they were eager for their dinner and the chance to lay down their arms for the night.

The pause gave William room for a momentâ€™s thought: ought he to ask Randall to sup with him later, try to draw him out? Or get the hell away from the man as quickly as possible, using his need to wait on Sir Henry as excuse? But what if Lord John really was with Sir Henry right this moment? And bloody Uncle Halâ€”all he needed in the present circumstance!

Randall had evidently used the pause for thought, as well, and come to his own decision. He came up close beside William, and after a quick glance to be sure no one was near them, leaned close and spoke in a low voice.

â€œI say this as a friend, Ellesmereâ€”though I grant youâ€™ve no reason to trust me, I hope youâ€™ll listen. Donâ€™t, for Godâ€™s sake, engage in any enterprise that Richardson suggests. Donâ€™t go with him anywhere, no matter what the circumstances. If you can avoid it, donâ€™t even talk to him again.â€

And with that, he reined his horseâ€™s head around, spurred up abruptly, and was off down the road at a gallop, heading away from the camp.





SCROUNGING

GREY WOULDNâ€™T MIND, if it werenâ€™t for the headaches. The ache in his side had faded to something tolerable; he thought a rib might be cracked, but as long as he didnâ€™t have to run, that wouldnâ€™t be a problem. The eye, though . . .

The injured eye stubbornly refused to move but jerked in its socket, pulling against whatever obstruction held itâ€”an orbicularis muscle? Was that what Dr. Hunter had called it?â€”in an attempt to focus with its fellow. This was painful and exhausting in itself but also led to double vision and crushing headaches, and he found himself often unable to eat when they halted, wanting only to lie down in darkness and wait for the throbbing to cease.

By the time they stopped to make camp on the evening of the second day of march, he could barely see out of his good eye, and his stomach was heaving with nausea.

â€œHere,â€ he said, thrusting his hot journeycake at one of his fellows, a tailor from Morristown named Phillipson. â€œYou take it. I canâ€™t, not just . . .â€ He couldnâ€™t go on, but pressed the heel of his hand hard against his closed eye. Green and yellow pinwheels and brilliant flashes of light erupted behind his eyelid, but the pressure eased the pain for a moment.

â€œYou save it for later, Bert,â€ Phillipson said, tucking the journeycake into Greyâ€™s rucksack. He bent close and peered at Greyâ€™s face in the firelight. â€œYou need a patch for that eye,â€ he declared. â€œKeep you from rubbing at it, at least; itâ€™s red as a whoreâ€™s stocking. Here.â€

And with that, he took off his own battered felt hat and, whipping a small pair of scissors from his bosom, cut a neat round patch from the brim, rubbed a bit of spruce gum round the edge to make it stick, and then bound it carefully in place over the injured orb with a spotted handkerchief contributed by one of the other militiamen. All of them clustered round to watch, with the kindest expressions of concern, offers of food and drink, suggestions as to which company had a surgeon that might come to let his blood, and so on. Grey, in the weakness of pain and exhaustion, thought he might weep.

He managed to thank them all for their concern, but at last they left off, and after a swig of something unidentifiable but strongly alcoholic from Jacobsâ€™s canteen, he sat on the ground, shut his good eye, leaned his head back against a log, and waited for the throbbing in his temples to lessen.

Despite his bodily discomfort, he felt comforted in spirit. The men with him werenâ€™t soldiers, and God knew they werenâ€™t an armyâ€”but they were men, engaged in common purpose and mindful of one another, and that was a thing he knew and loved.

â€œ. . . and we bring our needs and desires before thee, O great Lord, and implore thy blessing upon our deeds . . .â€

The Reverend Woodsworth was conducting a brief service of prayers. He did this every evening; those who wished might join him; those who didnâ€™t occupied themselves in quiet conversation or small tasks of mending or whittling.

Grey had no real idea where they were, save somewhere to the northeast of Philadelphia. Messengers on horseback met them now and then, and confused bits of news and speculation spread like fleas through the group. He gathered that the British army was heading northâ€”clearly to New Yorkâ€”and that Washington had left Valley Forge with his troops and was intending to attack Clinton somewhere en route, but no one knew where. The troops were to muster at a place called Coryellâ€™s Ferry, at which point they might, possibly, be told where they were going.

He didnâ€™t waste energy on thinking about his own position. He could escape easily enough in the darkness, but there was no point in doing so. Wandering around the countryside in the midst of converging militia companies and regular troops, he ran more risk of ending up back in the custody of Colonel Smith, who would probably hang him out of hand, than he did in remaining with Woodsworthâ€™s militia.

The danger might increase when they did join Washingtonâ€™s troopsâ€”but large armies really couldnâ€™t hide from each other, nor did they try to avoid notice. If Washington got anywhere near Clinton, Grey could at that point easily desertâ€”if one considered it desertionâ€”and cross the lines into British hands, risking only being shot by an overenthusiastic sentry before he could surrender and make himself known.

Gratitude, he thought, hearing Mr. Woodsworthâ€™s prayer through a haze of growing drowsiness and fading pain. Well, yes, there were a few more things he could count on his list of blessings.

William was still on parole and thus a noncombatant. Jamie Fraser had been released from the Continental army to escort Brigadier Fraserâ€™s body back to Scotland. Though heâ€™d returned, he was no longer in the army; he wouldnâ€™t be in this fight, either. His nephew Henry was healing, but in no way fit for combat. There was no one likely to be involved in the coming battleâ€”if there was oneâ€”over whom he need worry. Though come to think. . . . His hand found the empty pocket of his breeches. Hal. Where the bloody hell was Hal?

He sighed, but then relaxed, breathing in the scents of woodsmoke, pine needles, and roasted corn. Wherever Hal was, heâ€™d be safe enough. His brother could take care of himself.

The prayers over, one of his companions had started to sing. It was a song he knew, but the words were quite different. His version, picked up from an army surgeon whoâ€™d fought with the Colonials during the French and Indian war, went:



Brother Ephraim sold his Cow



And bought him a Commission;



And then he went to Canada



To fight for the Nation;



But when Ephraim he came home



He proved an arrant Coward,



He wouldnâ€™t fight the Frenchmen there



For fear of being devourâ€™d.



Dr. Shuckburgh hadnâ€™t had much opinion of the colonials, and neither had the composer of the newer version, used as a marching song. Heâ€™d heard that one in Philadelphia and hummed along under his breath.

Yankee Doodle came to town,



For to buy a firelock,



We will tar and feather him,



And so we will John Hancock!



His present companions were now singingâ€”with gustoâ€”the latest evolution:

Yankee Doodle went to town



A-riding on a pony,



Stuck a feather in his cap



And called it Macaroni!



He wondered, yawning, whether any of them knew that the word dudel meant â€œsimpletonâ€ in German. He doubted Morristown, New Jersey, had ever seen a macaroni, those affected young men who went in for pink wigs and a dozen face patches.

As his headache eased, he began to appreciate the simple pleasure of reclining. The shoes with their makeshift laces fit him badly and, as well as rubbing his heels raw, gave him shooting pains in the shins from the effort of constantly clenching his toes in order to keep the bloody things on. He stretched his legs gingerly, almost enjoying the tenderness in his muscles, so near bliss by contrast with walking.

He was distracted from his catalog of meager blessings by a small, hungry gulp near his ear, followed by a young, low voice.

â€œMister . . . if yeâ€™re not meaninâ€™ to eat that journeycake yourself . . .â€

â€œWhat? Oh . . . yes. Of course.â€

He struggled to sit up, one hand pressed protectively over his bad eye, and turned his head to see a boy of eleven or twelve sitting on the log just beside him. He had his hand inside his sack, rummaging for the food, when the boy let out a gasp, and he looked up, vision wavering in the firelight, to discover himself face-to-face with Claireâ€™s grandson, fair hair in a tousled halo round his head and a look of horror on his face.



â€œHush!â€ he said in a whisper, and grabbed the childâ€™s knee in such a sudden grip that the boy gave a small yelp.

â€œWhy, whatâ€™s that youâ€™ve got there, Bert? Caught you a thief?â€ Abe Shaffstall, distracted from a desultory game of knucklebones, looked over his shoulder, peering shortsightedly at the boyâ€”Christ, what was his name? His father was French; was it Claude? Henri? No, that was the younger boy, the dwarf. . . .

â€œTais-toi!â€ he said under his breath to the boy, and turned to his companions. â€œNo, noâ€”this is a neighborâ€™s son from Philadelphiaâ€”er . . . Bobby. Bobby Higgins,â€ he added, grabbing at the first name that offered itself. â€œWhatâ€™s brought you out here, son?â€ he asked, hoping that the boy was as quick-witted as his grandmother.

â€œLookinâ€™ for my grandda,â€ the boy replied promptly, though his eyes shifted uneasily round the circle of faces, now all aimed in his direction as the singing died away.

â€œMy mam sent me with some clothes and food for him, but some wicked fellows in the wood pulled me off my mule and . . . and t-took everything.â€ The boyâ€™s voice trembled realistically, and Grey noticed that, in fact, his dirty cheeks showed the tracks of tears.

This provoked a rumble of concern round the circle and the immediate production from pokes and pockets of hard bread, apples, dried meat, and dirty handkerchiefs.

â€œWhatâ€™s your grandpaâ€™s name, son?â€ Joe Buckman inquired. â€œWhat company is he with?â€

The boy looked nonplussed at this and shot a quick glance at Grey, who answered for him.

â€œJames Fraser,â€ he said, with a reassuring nod that made his head throb. â€œHeâ€™d be with one of the Pennsylvania companies, wouldnâ€™t he, Bobby?â€

â€œAye, sir.â€ The boy wiped his nose on the proffered handkerchief and gratefully accepted an apple. â€œMerâ€”â€ He interrupted himself with an artful coughing fit and amended this to â€œThank ye kindly, sir. And you, sir.â€ He handed back the handkerchief and set himself to ravenous consumption, this limiting his replies to nods and shakes of the head. Indistinct mumbles indicated that he had forgotten the number of his grandfatherâ€™s company.

â€œNo matter, boy,â€ Reverend Woodsworth said comfortingly. â€œWeâ€™re all a-going to the same place to muster. Youâ€™ll find your grandpa with the troops there, surely. You think you can keep up with us, though, a-foot?â€

â€œOh, aye, sir,â€ Germainâ€”that was it! Germain!â€”said, nodding fast. â€œI can walk.â€

â€œIâ€™ll take care of him,â€ Grey said hastily, and that seemed to settle it.

He waited impatiently until everyone had forgotten the boyâ€™s presence and begun to ready themselves for sleep, then rose, muscles protesting, and jerked his head at Germain to follow him, muffling an exclamation of pain at the movement.

â€œRight,â€ he said in a low voice, as soon as they were out of earshot. â€œWhat the devil are you doing out here? And where is your bloody grandfather?â€

â€œI was lookinâ€™ for him,â€ Germain replied, unbuttoning his flies to piss. â€œHeâ€™s gone toâ€”â€ He paused, obviously unsure what his relationship with Grey now was. â€œBeg pardon, my lord, but I dinna ken should I tell ye that or not. I mean . . .â€ The boy was no more than a silhouette against the darker black of the undergrowth, but even the outline of his body expressed an eloquent wariness. â€œComment se fait-il que vous soyez ici?â€

â€œHow did I come to be here,â€ Grey repeated under his breath. â€œComment, indeed. Never mind. Iâ€™ll tell you where weâ€™re going, shall I? I gather weâ€™re bound for a place called Coryellâ€™s Ferry to join General Washington. Does that ring a bell?â€

Germainâ€™s slender shoulders relaxed, and a soft pattering on the earth indicated that apparently it did. Grey joined him, and, finished, they turned back toward the glow of the campfire.

Still in the shelter of the woods, Grey put his hand on Germainâ€™s shoulder and squeezed. The boy stopped dead.

â€œAttendez, monsieur,â€ Grey said, low-voiced. â€œIf the militia learn who I am, theyâ€™ll hang me. Instantly. My life is in your hands from this moment. Comprenez-vous?â€

There was silence for an unnerving moment.

â€œAre you a spy, my lord?â€ Germain asked softly, not turning round.

Grey paused before answering, wavering between expediency and honesty. He could hardly forget what heâ€™d seen and heard, and when he made it back to his own lines, duty would compel him to pass on such information as he had.

â€œNot by choice,â€ he said at last, just as softly.

A cool breeze had risen with the setting of the sun, and the forest murmured all around them.

â€œBien,â€ Germain said at last. â€œAnd thank ye for the food.â€ He turned then, and Grey could see the glint of firelight on one fair brow, arched in inquisitiveness.

â€œSo I am Bobby Higgins. Who are you, then?â€

â€œBert Armstrong,â€ Grey replied shortly. â€œCall me Bert.â€

He led the way then toward the fire and the blanket-humped rolls of sleeping men. He couldnâ€™t quite tell, above the rustling of the trees and the snoring of his fellows, but he thought the little bugger was laughing.





MORPHIA DREAMS

WE SLEPT THAT NIGHT in the public room of an ordinary in Langhorne. Bodies were sprawled on tables and benches, curled under the tables, and laid in haphazard arrangements on pallets, folded cloaks, and saddlebags, as far away from the hearth as they could get. The fire was banked, but it still radiated considerable heat. The room was filled with the bitter scents of burning wood and boiling bodies. I estimated the temperature in the room at something like ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit, and the slumbering bodies on display were largely unclad, pale haunches, shoulders, and bosoms glimmering in the sullen glow of the embers.

Jamie had been traveling in shirt and breeches, his new uniform and its dazzling smallclothes carefully folded into a portmanteau until we got within range of the army, so his disrobing was a simple matter of unbuttoning his flies and pulling off his stockings. Mine was complicated by the fact that my traveling stays had leather laces, and over the course of a sweat-drenched day, the knot had tightened into a stubborn nodule that resisted all attempts.

â€œAre ye no coming to bed, Sassenach?â€ Jamie was already lying down, having found a remote corner behind the bar counter and spread out our cloaks.

â€œIâ€™ve broken a fingernail trying to get this bloody thing loose, and I canâ€™t bloody reach it with my teeth!â€ I said, on the verge of breaking into tears of frustration. I was swaying with weariness, but couldnâ€™t bring myself to sleep in the clammy confines of my stays.

Jamie reached up an arm out of the darkness, beckoning.

â€œCome lie down wiâ€™ me, Sassenach,â€ he whispered. â€œIâ€™ll do it.â€

The simple relief of lying down, after twelve hours in the saddle, was so exquisite that I nearly changed my mind about sleeping in my stays, but heâ€™d meant it. He squirmed down and bent his head to nuzzle at my laces, an arm round my back to steady me.

â€œDinna fash,â€ he murmured into my midsection, voice somewhat muffled. â€œIf I canna nibble it loose, Iâ€™ll prise it wiâ€™ my dirk.â€

He looked up with an inquiring noise, as Iâ€™d uttered a strangled laugh at the prospect.

â€œJust trying to decide whether being accidentally disemboweled would be worse than sleeping in my stays,â€ I whispered, cupping his head. It was warm, the soft hair at his nape damp to the touch.



â€œMy aimâ€™s no that bad, Sassenach,â€ he said, pausing in his labors for an instant. â€œIâ€™d only risk stabbinâ€™ ye in the heart.â€

As it was, he accomplished his goal without recourse to weapons, gently jerking the knot loose with his teeth until he could finish the job with his fingers, opening the heavy seamed canvas stays like a clamshell to expose the whiteness of my shift. I sighed like a grateful mollusk opening at high tide, plucking the fabric out of the creases the stays had made in my flesh. Jamie pushed away the discarded stays but remained where he was, his face near my breasts, rubbing his hands gently over my sides.

I sighed again at his touch; heâ€™d done it by habit, but it was a habit Iâ€™d missed for the last four months, and a touch Iâ€™d thought never to feel again.

â€œYeâ€™re too thin, Sassenach,â€ he whispered. â€œI can feel every rib. Iâ€™ll find ye food tomorrow.â€

I had been too much preoccupied in the last few days to think about food, and was much too tired at the moment to be hungry, but made an agreeable sound in response and stroked his hair, tracing the curve of his skull.

â€œI love you, a nighean,â€ he said, very softly, his breath warm on my skin.

â€œI love you,â€ I answered just as softly, taking the ribbon from his hair and loosening his plait between my fingers. I pressed his head closer to me, not in invitation, but out of the sudden urgent need to keep him close to me, to protect him.

He kissed my breast and turned his head, laying it in the hollow of my shoulder. He took one deep breath, one more, and then was asleep, the relaxing weight of his body against me both protection and trust.

â€œI love you,â€ I said, almost soundless, my arms wrapped tight about him. â€œOh, dear God, I love you.â€



IT MIGHT HAVE been the sense of overwhelming fatigue, or the smell, the mingling of alcohol and unwashed bodies, that made me dream of the hospital.

I was walking down the little hall beyond the menâ€™s ward at the hospital where Iâ€™d done my nurseâ€™s training, the tiny bottle of morphia grains in my hand. The walls were dingy gray; so was the air. At the end of the hall was the alcohol bath where the syringes were kept.

I lifted one out, cold and slippery, careful not to drop it. But I did drop it; it slid from my hand and shattered on the floor, spraying glass shards that cut my legs.

I couldnâ€™t worry about that; I had to get back with the morphine injectionâ€”men were calling out behind me, desperate, and somehow it was the sound of the operating tent in France back there, men moaning, screams and hopeless sobbing, and my fingers shook with urgency, groping in the cold steel bath among glass syringes that rattled like bones.

I pulled one out, gripping it so tightly that it, too, broke in my hand, and blood ran down my wrist, but I wasnâ€™t conscious of pain. Another, I must have another; they were in dreadful pain and I could stop it, if only . . .



Somehow I had a clean syringe and had got the top off the tiny bottle of morphia grains, but my hand was shaking, the grains spilling like salt; Sister Amos would be furious. I needed tweezers, forceps; I couldnâ€™t grasp the tiny pellets with my fingers and, in a panic, shook several of them into the syringe, a whole grain, not the quarter grain called for, but I had to get to the men, had to stop their pain.

Then I was running back down the endless gray hall toward the cries, shards of glass glinting among the red blood drops on the floor, both as bright as dragonfly wings. But my hand was growing numb, and the last syringe fell from my fingers before I reached the door.

And I woke up with a jolt that seemed to stop my heart. I gulped smoke and the fug of beer and bodies, not knowing where I was.

â€œJesus, Sassenach, are ye all right?â€ Jamie, startled out of sleep, rolled up onto his elbow above me, and I came back into the present with as much of a jolt as my awakening had been. My left arm was numb from the shoulder down, and there were tears on my cheeks; I felt the coolness on my skin.

â€œI . . . yes. Just a . . . a bad dream.â€ I felt ashamed to confess it, as though it were his privilege alone to suffer nightmares.

â€œAh.â€ He lowered himself beside me with a sigh and gathered me to him with one arm. He ran a thumb over my face and, finding wetness, blotted it matter-of-factly with his shirt. â€œAll right now?â€ he whispered, and I nodded, thankful that I neednâ€™t talk about it.

â€œGood.â€ He stroked the hair off my face and rubbed my back gently, the circles of his hand growing gradually slower until he fell asleep again.

It was deep night, and a deep sleep lay upon the room. The whole of it seemed to breathe in unison, snores and gasps and grunts all fading into something like the waves of a receding tide, rising and falling and bearing me with them, safely back into the depths of sleep.

Only the pins and needles of feeling returning to my dead arm kept me from it, and that only momentarily.

I could still see the blood and the shards of glass and heard against the susurrus of snores the crash of falling crystal, saw the bloody smudges on the wallpaper at Number 17.

Dear Lord, I prayed, listening to Jamieâ€™s heart under my ear, slow and steady. Whatever happens, let him have a chance to talk to William.





TAKEN AT A DISADVANTAGE

WILLIAM LED HIS HORSE down among the rocks to a level place where both of them could drink. It was midafternoon, and after a day spent riding to and fro along the column in the blazing sun, he was parched as a piece of last yearâ€™s venison jerky.

His present horse was Madras, a cob with a deep chest and a steady, stolid disposition. The horse waded purposefully into the stream, hock-deep, and sank his nose into the water with a blissful snort, shivering his coat against the cloud of flies that appeared instantly out of nowhere whenever they stopped.

William waved a couple of insects away from his own face and took off his coat for a momentâ€™s relief from the heat. He was tempted to wade in, tooâ€”up to his neck, if the creek was deep enoughâ€”but . . . well . . . He looked cautiously over his shoulder, but he was well out of sight, though he could hear the sounds of the baggage train on the distant road. Why not? Just for a moment. It wasnâ€™t as though the dispatch he was carrying was urgent; heâ€™d seen it written, and it contained nothing more than an invitation for General von Knyphausen to join General Clinton for supper at an inn with a reputation for good pork. Everyone was wringing with sweat; dampness would be no telltale.

He hastily shucked shoes, shirt, stockings, breeches, and smalls, and walked naked into the purling water, which barely reached his waist but was wet and cool. He closed his eyes in blissful reliefâ€”and opened them abruptly a half second later.

â€œWilliam!â€

Madras flung up his head with a startled snort, showering William with droplets, but he barely noticed in the shock of seeing two young women standing on the opposite bank.

â€œWhat the devil are you doing here?â€ He tried to squat a little lower in the water without being conspicuous about it. Though a dim voice in the back of his mind wondered aloud why he bothered: Arabellaâ€“Jane had already seen anything he had. â€œAnd whoâ€™s that?â€ he demanded, jerking his chin at the other girl. Both of them were flushed as summer roses, but he thoughtâ€”he hopedâ€”it was the result of the heat.

â€œThis is my sister, Frances,â€ Jane said, with the elegance of a Philadelphia matron, and gestured to the younger girl. â€œCurtsy to his lordship, now, Fanny.â€

Fanny, a very lovely young girl with dark curls peeping out under her capâ€”what was she, eleven, twelve?â€”bobbed him a sweet curtsy, blue-and- red-calico petticoats outspread, and dropped long lashes modestly over the big, soft eyes of a young doe.

â€œYour most humble servant, mademoiselle,â€ he said, bowing with as much grace as possible, which, judging from the expressions on the girlsâ€™ faces, was probably a mistake. Fanny clapped a hand over her mouth and went much redder from the effort not to laugh.

â€œI am charmed to meet your sister,â€ he said to Jane, rather coldly. â€œBut I fear you take me at something of a disadvantage, madam.â€

â€œYes, thatâ€™s a piece of luck,â€ Jane agreed. â€œI couldnâ€™t think how we were to find you in that moil, and when we saw you ride past like the fiend was after youâ€”weâ€™d got a ride on a baggage wagonâ€”I didnâ€™t think weâ€™d ever catch you. But we took the chance, and . . . voilÃ ! Fortuna favet audax, you know.â€ She wasnâ€™t even trying to pretend she wasnâ€™t laughing at him!

He scrabbled for some cutting rejoinder in Greek, but the only thing that came to his inflamed mind was a humiliating echo from his past, something his father had said to him on the occasion when heâ€™d accidentally fallen into a privy: â€œWhat news from the underworld, Persephone?â€

â€œTurn your backs,â€ he said curtly. â€œIâ€™m getting out.â€

They didnâ€™t. Gritting his teeth, he turned his own back on them and deliberately climbed the bank, feeling the itch of four interested eyes focused on his dripping backside. He grabbed his shirt and wrestled his way into it, feeling that even that much shelter would enable him to carry on the conversation in a more dignified manner. Or maybe heâ€™d just tuck his breeches and boots under his arm and leave without further chat.

The sound of heavy splashing whilst he was still enveloped in the folds of his shirt made him whirl round, head popping free just in time to see Madras lunge up out of the creek on the girlsâ€™ side, lips already reaching for the apple Jane was holding out to him.

â€œCome back here, sir!â€ he shouted. But the girls had more apples, and the horse paid no attention whateverâ€”nor did he object when Arabellaâ€“Jane took his reins and looped them casually round the trunk of a young willow.

â€œI noticed that you didnâ€™t ask how we came to be here,â€ she said. â€œDoubtless surprise has deprived you of your usual exquisite manners.â€ She dimpled at him and he eyed her severely.

â€œI did,â€ he said. â€œI distinctly recall saying, â€˜What. The. Devil. Are. You. Doing. Here.â€™â€

â€œOh, so you did,â€ she said, without a blush. â€œWell, not to put too fine a point on the matter, Captain Harkness came back.â€

â€œOh,â€ he said, in a slightly different tone. â€œI see. You, um, ran away, then?â€

Frances nodded solemnly.

William cleared his throat. â€œWhy? Captain Harkness is doubtless with the army. Why would you come here, of all places, instead of staying safe in Philadelphia?â€

â€œNo, he isnâ€™t,â€ Jane said. â€œHe was detained on business in Philadelphia. So we came away. Besides,â€ she added carelessly, â€œthere are thousands of women with the army. Heâ€™d never find us, even if he was lookingâ€”and why should he be?â€



That was reasonable. Still . . . he knew what the life of an army whore was like. He also had a strong suspicion that the girls had run out on their contract with the brothel; very few saved enough from their wages to buy their way out, and both of these girls were much too young to have made much money. To abandon the reasonable comfort of clean beds and regular meals in Philadelphia in order to accommodate filthy, sweating soldiers amidst mud and flies, paid in blows as often as in coin . . . Yet he was obliged to admit that heâ€™d never been buggered by a vicious sod like Harkness and thus had no true basis for comparison.

â€œI expect you want money, to assist in your escape?â€ he said, an edge in his voice.

â€œWell, perhaps,â€ said Jane. Reaching into her pocket, she held up something shiny. â€œMostly, I wanted to give this back to you.â€

His gorget! He took an involuntary step toward her, toes squelching in the mud.

â€œIâ€”thank you,â€ he said abruptly. Heâ€™d felt its lack every time he dressed, and felt even more the weight of his fellow officersâ€™ eyes on the empty spot where it should rest. Heâ€™d been obliged to explain to Colonel Desplains what had happenedâ€”more or lessâ€”saying that heâ€™d been robbed in a bawdy house. Desplains had chewed him bloody, but then had given him reluctant leave to appear without a gorget until he might get another in New York.

â€œWhat Iâ€”we, I meanâ€”really want is your protection,â€ Jane said, doing her best to look winsomely earnest, and doing it damned well.

â€œYou what?â€

â€œI donâ€™t think I should have any difficulty in making a living with the army,â€ she said frankly, â€œbut â€™tisnâ€™t really what I want for my dear sister, that sort of life.â€

â€œEr . . . no. I imagine not,â€ William said warily. â€œWhat else did you have in mind?â€ â€œLadyâ€™s maid?â€ he wanted to suggest sarcastically, but in light of the return of his gorget, he refrained.

â€œI havenâ€™t quite made up my mind,â€ she said, fastening her gaze on the ripples where the creek ran over rocks. â€œBut if you could help us to get safely to New Yorkâ€”and maybe find us a place there . . .â€

William ran a hand down his face, wiping away a layer of fresh sweat.

â€œDonâ€™t want much, do you?â€ he said. On the one hand, if he didnâ€™t give her some assurance of help, he wouldnâ€™t put it past her to fling his gorget into the water in a fit of pique. And on the other . . . Frances was a lovely child, delicate and pale as a morning-glory blossom. And on the third hand, he hadnâ€™t any more time to spare in argument.

â€œGet on the horse and come across,â€ he said abruptly. â€œIâ€™ll find you a new place with the baggage train. I have to ride a dispatch to von Knyphausen just now, but Iâ€™ll meet you in General Clintonâ€™s camp this eveningâ€”no, not this evening, I wonâ€™t be back until tomorrow. . . .â€ He fumbled for a moment, wondering where to tell her to find him; he could not have two young whores asking for him at General Clintonâ€™s headquarters. â€œGo to the surgeonsâ€™ tent at sundown tomorrow. Iâ€™llâ€”think of something.â€





IN WHICH I MEET A TURNIP

DURING THE NEXT DAYâ€™S ride, we encountered a messenger, sent back from Washingtonâ€™s command with a note for Jamie. He read this leaning against a tree, while I made an unobtrusive visit to a nearby clump of brush.

â€œWhat does he say?â€ I asked, straightening my clothes as I emerged. I was still rather awed that Jamie had actually spoken with George Washington, and the fact that he was frowning at a letter presumably written by the future Father of the Country . . .

â€œTwo or three things,â€ he replied with a shrug, and, refolding the note, stuffed it into his pocket. â€œThe only important bit oâ€™ news is that my brigade is to be under the command of Charles Lee.â€

â€œDo you know Charles Lee?â€ I got my foot into the stirrup and heaved myself into the saddle.

â€œI know of him.â€ What he knew appeared to be rather problematic, judging from the line between his brows. I raised my own; he glanced at me and smiled.

â€œI met him, ken, when I first met General Washington. I made it my business to learn a bit more about him since.â€

â€œOh, so you didnâ€™t like him,â€ I observed, and he gave me a small snort.

â€œNo, I didnâ€™t,â€ he said, nudging his horse into a walk. â€œHeâ€™s loud and unmannerly and a slovenâ€”I could see that much for myselfâ€”but from what Iâ€™ve heard since, heâ€™s also jealous to the bone and doesna trouble to hide it verra well.â€

â€œJealous? Of whom?â€ Not Jamie, I hoped.

â€œOf Washington,â€ he answered matter-of-factly, surprising me. â€œHe thought he should have command oâ€™ the Continental army and doesna like playinâ€™ second fiddle.â€

â€œReally?â€ Iâ€™d never once heard of General Charles Lee, which seemed odd, if he had such prominence as to have made that a reasonable expectation. â€œWhy does he think that, do you know?â€

â€œI do. He feels he has a good deal more in the way of military experience than Washingtonâ€”and thatâ€™s maybe true: he was in the British army for some time and fought a number of successful campaigns. Stillâ€”â€ He lifted one shoulder and dropped it, dismissing General Lee for the moment. â€œI wouldna have agreed to do this, had it been Lee who asked me.â€

â€œI thought you didnâ€™t want to do it, regardless.â€

â€œMmphm.â€ He considered for a moment. â€œItâ€™s true I didna want to do thisâ€”I donâ€™t now.â€ He looked at me, apologetic. â€œAnd I truly dinna want you to be here.â€

â€œIâ€™m going to be where you are for the rest of our lives,â€ I said firmly. â€œIf thatâ€™s a week or another forty years.â€

â€œLonger,â€ he said, and smiled.

We rode for a time in silence, but deeply aware of each other. We had been, since that conversation in the gardens at Kingsessing.

â€œI will love ye forever. It doesna matter if ye sleep with the whole English armyâ€”well, no, it would matter, but it wouldna stop me loving you.â€

â€œIâ€™ve taken ye to bed a thousand times at least, Sassenach. Did ye think I wasna paying attention?â€

â€œThere couldna be anyone like you.â€

I hadnâ€™t forgotten a word weâ€™d saidâ€”and neither had he, though neither one of us had spoken of it again. We werenâ€™t walking on tiptoe with each other, but we were feeling our way . . . finding our way into each other, as weâ€™d done twice before. Once, when Iâ€™d returned to find him in Edinburghâ€”and at the beginning, when weâ€™d found ourselves wed by force and joined by circumstance. Only later, by choice.

â€œWhat would you have wanted to be?â€ I asked, on impulse. â€œIf you hadnâ€™t been born the laird of Lallybroch?â€

â€œI wasnâ€™t. If my elder brother hadna died, ye mean,â€ he said. A small shadow of regret crossed his face, but didnâ€™t linger. He still mourned the boy who had died at eleven, leaving a small brother to pick up the burden of leadership and struggle to grow into itâ€”but he had been accustomed to that burden for a very long time.

â€œMaybe that,â€ I said. â€œBut what if youâ€™d been born elsewhere, maybe to a different family?â€

â€œWell, I wouldna be who I am, then, would I?â€ he said logically, and smiled at me. â€œI may quibble wiâ€™ what the Lordâ€™s called me to do now and then, Sassenachâ€”but Iâ€™ve nay argument wiâ€™ how he made me.â€

I looked at what he wasâ€”the strong, straight body and capable hands, the face so full of everything he wasâ€”and had no argument, either.

â€œBesides,â€ he said, and tilted his head consideringly, â€œif it had been different, I wouldna have you, would I? Or have had Brianna and her weans?â€

If it had been different . . . I didnâ€™t ask whether he thought his life as it was had been worth the cost.

He leaned over and touched my cheek.

â€œItâ€™s worth it, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œFor me.â€

I cleared my throat.

â€œFor me, too.â€



IAN AND ROLLO caught us up a few miles from Coryellâ€™s Ferry. Darkness had fallen, but the glow of the camp was faintly visible against the sky, and we made our way cautiously in, being stopped every quarter mile or so by sentries who popped unnervingly out of the dark, muskets at the ready.



â€œFriend or foe?â€ the sixth of these demanded dramatically, peering at us in the beam of a dark lantern held high.

â€œGeneral Fraser and his lady,â€ Jamie said, shielding his eyes with his hand and glaring down at the sentry. â€œIs that friendly enough for ye?â€

I muffled a smile in my shawl; heâ€™d refused to stop to find food along the way, and Iâ€™d refused to let him consume uncooked bacon, no matter how well smoked. Jennyâ€™s four apples hadnâ€™t gone far, weâ€™d found no food since the night before, and he was starving. An empty stomach generally woke the fiend that slept within, and this was clearly in evidence at the moment.

â€œEr . . . yes, sir, General, I onlyâ€”â€ The lanternâ€™s beam of light shifted to rest on Rollo, catching him full in the face and turning his eyes to an eerie green flash. The sentry made a strangled noise, and Ian leaned down from his horse, his own faceâ€”Mohawk tattoos and allâ€”appearing suddenly in the beam.

â€œDinna mind us,â€ he said genially to the sentry. â€œWeâ€™re friendly, too.â€



TO MY SURPRISE, there was actually a good-sized settlement at the Ferry, with several inns and substantial houses perched on the bank of the Delaware.

â€œI suppose thatâ€™s why Washington chose this as the rendezvous point?â€ I asked Jamie. â€œGood staging, I mean, and some supply.â€

â€œAye, thereâ€™s that,â€ he said, though he spoke abstractedly. Heâ€™d risen a little in his stirrups, looking over the scene. Every window in every house was lit, but a large American flag, with its circle of stars, flapped above the door of the largest inn. Washingtonâ€™s headquarters, then.

My chief concern was to get some food into Jamie before he met with General Lee, if the aforementioned indeed had a reputation for arrogance and short temper. I didnâ€™t know what it was about red hair, but many yearsâ€™ experience with Jamie, Brianna, and Jemmy had taught me that while most people became irritable when hungry, a redheaded person with an empty stomach was a walking time bomb.

I sent Ian and Rollo with Jamie to find the quartermaster, discover what we might have in the way of accommodation, and unload the pack mule, then followed my nose toward the nearest scent of food.

The dug-in camp kitchens would long since have banked their fires, but Iâ€™d been in many army camps and knew how they worked; small kettles would be simmering all night, filled with stew and porridge for the morningâ€”the more so as the army was in hot pursuit of General Clinton. Amazing to think that I had met him socially only a few days beforeâ€”

Iâ€™d been so focused on my quest that I hadnâ€™t seen a man come out of the half dark and nearly ran into him. He seized me by the arms and we waltzed a dizzy half-turn before coming to rest.

â€œPardon, madame! I am afraid I have stepped upon your foot!â€ said a young French voice, very concerned, and I looked straight into the very concerned face of a very young man. He was in shirtsleeves and breeches, but I could see that his shirtsleeves sported deep, lace-trimmed cuffs. An officer, then, in spite of his youth.

â€œWell, yes, you have,â€ I said mildly, â€œbut donâ€™t worry about it. Iâ€™m not damaged.â€

â€œJe suis tellement dÃ©solÃ©, je suis un navet!â€ he exclaimed, striking himself in the forehead. He wore no wig, and I saw that despite his age, his hair was receding at a rapid pace. What was left of it was red and inclined to stand on endâ€”possibly owing to his apparent habit of thrusting his fingers through it, which he was now doing.

â€œNonsense,â€ I said in French, laughing. â€œYou arenâ€™t a turnip at all.â€

â€œOh, yes,â€ he said, switching to English. He smiled charmingly at me. â€œI once stepped on the foot of the Queen of France. She was much less gracious, sa MajestÃ©,â€ he added ruefully. â€œShe called me a turnip. Still, if it hadnâ€™t happenedâ€”I was obliged to leave the court, you knowâ€”perhaps I would never have come to America, so we cannot bemoan my clumsiness altogether, nâ€™est-ce pas?â€

He was exceedingly cheerful and smelled of wineâ€”not that that was in any way unusual. But given his exceeding Frenchness, his evident wealth, and his tender age, I was beginning to thinkâ€”

â€œHave I the, um, honor of addressingâ€”â€ Bloody hell, what was his actual title? Assuming that he really wasâ€”

â€œPardon, madame!â€ he exclaimed, and, seizing my hand, bowed low over it and kissed it. â€œMarie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, a votre service!â€

I managed to pick â€œLa Fayetteâ€ out of this torrent of Gallic syllables and felt the odd little thump of excitement that happened whenever I met someone I knew of from historical accountsâ€”though cold sober realism told me that these people were usually no more remarkable than the people who were cautious or lucky enough not to end up decorating historical accounts with their blood and entrails.

I gathered sufficient composure to inform him that I was Madame General Fraser and that I was sure my husband would shortly be along to pay his respects, directly I had located some supper.

â€œBut you must come and dine with me, madame!â€ he said, and, having not let go of my hand, was in a position to tuck it cozily into his elbow and tow me off toward a large building that looked like an inn of some sort. An inn was precisely what it was, but an inn that had been commandeered by the Rebel forces and was now General Washingtonâ€™s headquartersâ€”as I discovered when le marquis led me under a fluttering banner, through the taproom, and into a large back room where a number of officers were sitting at table, presided over by a large man who did not look precisely like the image on a dollar bill, but close enough.

â€œMon GÃ©nÃ©ral,â€ the marquis said, bowing to Washington and then gesturing to me. â€œI have the honor to present to you Madame General Fraser, the personification of grace and loveliness!â€

The table rose as one, with a screeching of wooden benches, and the menâ€”in fact, there were only six of themâ€”rose and bowed to me in turn, murmuring, â€œYour servant,â€ and â€œYour most obedient, maâ€™am.â€ Washington himself stood up at the head of the tableâ€”My God, heâ€™s as tall as Jamie, I thoughtâ€”and gave me a very graceful bow, hand on his bosom.

â€œI am honored by your presence, Mrs. Fraser,â€ he said, in a soft Virginia drawl. â€œDare I hope that your husband accompanies you?â€

I had a momentâ€™s insane impulse to reply, â€œNo, he sent me to fight instead,â€ but managed not to say it.

â€œHe does,â€ I replied instead. â€œHeâ€™s . . . er . . .â€ I gestured helplessly toward the doorway, whereâ€”with remarkably good timingâ€”Jamie himself now appeared, brushing pine needles off his sleeve and saying something to Young Ian, behind him.

â€œThere ye are!â€ he exclaimed, spotting me. â€œSomeone told me yeâ€™d gone off with a strange Frenchman. Whatâ€”â€ He stopped abruptly, having suddenly realized that I wasnâ€™t merely in the company of a strange Frenchman.

The table fell about laughing, and La Fayette rushed up to Jamie and seized his hand, beaming.

â€œMon frÃ¨re dâ€™armes!â€ He clicked his heels together, doubtless by reflex, and bowed. â€œI must apologize for having stolen your lovely wife, sir. Allow me, please, to make recompense by inviting you to dinner!â€

Iâ€™d met Anthony Wayne before, at Ticonderoga, and was pleased to see him again. I was also delighted to see Dan Morgan, who gave me a hearty buss on both cheeks, and I admitted to a certain thrill at having my hand kissed by George Washington, though noticing the halitosis that accompanied his notorious dental problems. I wondered how I might make an opportunity to inspect his teeth, but gave such speculations up immediately with the arrival of a procession of servants with trays of fried fish, roast chicken, buttermilk biscuits with honey, and an amazing selection of ripe cheeses, these having beenâ€”he told meâ€”brought by the marquis himself from France.

â€œTry this one,â€ he urged me, cutting a slab of an extremely fragrant Roquefort, green-veined and crumbly. Nathanael Greene, who sat on the other side of the marquis, pinched his nose unobtrusively and gave me a small private smile. I smiled backâ€”but in fact I quite liked strong cheese.

I wasnâ€™t the only one. Rollo, who had come inâ€”naturallyâ€”with Young Ian and was sitting behind him, across the table from me, lifted his head and poked a long, hairy snout between Ian and General Lee, sniffing interestedly at the cheese.

â€œGood Christ!â€ Lee apparently hadnâ€™t noticed the dog before this and flung himself to one side, nearly ending in Jamieâ€™s lap. This action distracted Rollo, who turned to Lee, sniffing him with close attention.

I didnâ€™t blame the dog. Charles Lee was a tall, thin man with a long, thin nose and the most revolting eating habits Iâ€™d seen since Jemmy had learned to feed himself with a spoon. He not only talked while he ate and chewed with his mouth open, but was given to wild gestures while holding things in his hand, with the result that the front of his uniform was streaked with egg, soup, jelly, and a number of less identifiable substances.

Despite this, he was an amusing, witty manâ€”and the others seemed to give him a certain deference. I wondered why; unlike some of the gentlemen at the table, Charles Lee never attained renown as a Revolutionary figure. He treated them with a certain . . . well, it wasnâ€™t scorn, certainlyâ€”condescension, perhaps?

I was taken up in conversationâ€”mostly with the marquis, who was putting himself out to be charming to me, telling me how much he missed his wife (Good Lord, how old was he? I wondered. He didnâ€™t look more than twenty, if that), who had been responsible for the cheese. No, no, not making it herself, but it came from their estate at Chavaniac, which his wife ran most ably in his absenceâ€”but now and then caught a glimpse of Jamie. He took part in the conversation, but I could see his eyes flick round the table, appraising, judging. And they rested most often on General Lee, beside him.

Of course, he knew Wayne and Morgan quite wellâ€”and he knew what Iâ€™d been able to tell him about Washington and La Fayette. God, I hoped what I thought I knew about them was halfway accurateâ€”but weâ€™d find out soon enough if it wasnâ€™t.

Port wine was broughtâ€”evidently the meal was being hosted by the marquis; I had the distinct feeling that the high command of the Continental army didnâ€™t always eat this well. The men had largely avoided talking about the impending battle during the meal, but I could feel the subject looming like an approaching thunderstorm, bright-rimmed black clouds, excitingly shot with flickers of lightning. I began to rearrange my skirts and make gestures of incipient leave-taking, and saw Jamie, seated next to Lee across the table, notice and smile at me.

Lee noticed, tooâ€”heâ€™d been gazing in an absent way at my dÃ©colletageâ€”and broke off the anecdote heâ€™d been telling Ian, seated on his other side.

â€œSuch a pleasure to make your acquaintance, maâ€™am,â€ he said cordially. â€œYour husband obliges us extremely by allowing us the delight of your company. Iâ€”â€

Lee stopped abruptly in mid-sentenceâ€”and mid-bite, staring at Rollo, who had unobtrusively moved closer and was now standing no more than a couple of feet from the general. Given the low bench on which Lee was sitting and Rolloâ€™s size, this proximity placed them roughly eye-to-eye.

â€œWhy is that dog looking at me like that?â€ Lee demanded, swinging round to glare at Ian.

â€œHeâ€™s waitinâ€™ to see what ye drop next, I expect,â€ Ian said, chewing placidly.

â€œIf I were you, sir,â€ Jamie put in politely, â€œIâ€™d drop something quickly.â€



IAN, ROLLO, AND I took our leave of the generals and went out into the dark to find our beds, escorted by an orderly with a lantern. Fires burned high all up and down the bank of the Delaware, and many of the boats on the river had lanterns or open fires as well, the lights reflecting in the water like shoals of glimmering fish.

â€œDo you know anything about the man who ate beside you?â€ I asked Ian, in my hesitant Gaelic. He laughedâ€”he and Jamie always laughed when I spoke Gaelicâ€”but lifted one shoulder in a negative shrug.

â€œI do not, but I will find out,â€ he said. â€œHe is an Englishman, I can tell you that much.â€

He used the word â€œSassenach,â€ which gave me a mild shock. It had been a long time since Iâ€™d heard a Scot use that word in the way it was meant.

â€œYes, he is. Do you think it makes a difference?â€ Technically, they were all still Englishmenâ€”well, bar La Fayette, von Steuben, Kosciuszko, and similar odditiesâ€”but it was true that most of the Continental officers had been born and spent their lives in America. Lee hadnâ€™t. Ian made a derisory Scottish noise, indicating that it did.

â€œBut I hear that he was adopted into the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka, too,â€ I objected.

Ian was silent for a moment, then took my arm, leaning close to speak in my ear.

â€œAuntie,â€ he said softly. â€œDâ€™ye think I ever stopped beinâ€™ a Scot?â€





VESTAL VIRGINS

JAMIE AND I WERE billeted at the home of the Chenowyths, a pleasantâ€”if understandably somewhat anxiousâ€”family whose home stood at the end of the single road that ran through Coryellâ€™s Ferry. Mrs. Chenowyth was in her wrapper, but greeted me kindly with a candlestick and took me to a small bedroom at the back of the houseâ€”this showing the evidence of hasty evacuation by a number of young Chenowyths, these presumably now sharing their parentsâ€™ room, judging from the sounds of mixed heavy breathing.

The single bed was fairly large, though Jamieâ€™s feet would still stick out by a good six inches. There was a washbasin and ewer full of fresh water; I picked this up carefully and drank from it; my throat was dry from too much French wine. I replaced the ewer and sat down on the bed, feeling rather strange.

Possibly it was the wine. Possibly it was the fact that the room had no windows, and Mrs. Chenowyth had thoughtfully closed the door behind her. It was a small room, perhaps ten feet by eight. The air was still and the candleâ€™s flame burned high and steady, pure against the bricks of the wall. Perhaps it was the candle that brought to mind Uncle Lamb and the day heâ€™d told me about vestal virgins, showing me a blue chalcedony carving from the temple of Vesta.

â€œShould a virgin betray her vows,â€ heâ€™d said, waggling his eyebrows at me, â€œsheâ€™d be whipped, then sealed up alive in a small underground tomb, equipped with a table and chair, some water, and a single candle. And there she would die, when the air ran out.â€

Iâ€™d considered that with a sort of morbid relishâ€”I might have been tenâ€”and then asked with interest just how a vestal might betray her vows. Which is how I learned what used to be called â€œthe facts of life,â€ Uncle Lamb not being one to shirk any fact that wandered across his path, or mine. And while Uncle Lamb had assured me that the cult of Vesta had long since ceased operations, I had at that point resolved not to be a virgin, just in case. On the whole, a good resolution, though sleeping with men did have the most peculiar side effects.

Ian had brought along my saddlebags, which heâ€™d dumped in the corner of the room before going off with Rollo to find his own sleeping place. I got up and fumbled for my toothbrush and tooth powder, though it seemed quite surreal to be brushing my teeth on what might be the eve of battle. Not quite rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic . . . or at least I hoped not.

I knew that Washington and the marquis were going to survive whatever happenedâ€”and spared a thought for the strangeness of now thinking of them as men and not names. The large pores on George Washingtonâ€™s nose as heâ€™d bent over my hand, and the shadowed pits of old smallpox scars across his lower cheeks; the smell of him, starch and sweat, wine and wig powderâ€”for he wore his wig, hot as it wasâ€”the sweetly nasty smell of dental decay . . . I picked up my toothbrush, reminded, and set to work with some vigor. Heâ€™d smelled of blood, too; I wondered whyâ€”bleeding gums, perhaps?

I wriggled my way out of gown, jacket, and stays and stood for a bit flapping my shift, in hopes of admitting a little air. It made the candle flicker but didnâ€™t have much effect beyond that, so I blew the candle out and lay down.

I didnâ€™t expect to sleep. Adrenaline had been jolting through me like the current in a faulty circuit ever since weâ€™d left Philadelphia, but now it was settling down to a steady humming in my blood. The conversation over dinner had been fairly general, but the atmosphere had been electric with anticipation. Clearly, once Ian and I had left and the plates had been removed . . . It was as close as I had ever been to a council of war, and the vibrations of it were still tingling through me.

There was anxiety tingling, too, to be sureâ€”there had been amongst the men, as well. But given a suitable outlet, anxiety can be transformed into very effective action, and thatâ€™s plainly what Washington and his generals were now doing, hammering out plans, assigning troops, drawing up strategies . . . I wished I was amongst them. It would be much easier than lying in the pitch dark, staring up into a boring infinityâ€”nasty way to die, that.

I sat up, gulping air, and went hastily to the door. No sounds, no light seeping under the door. I patted round on the floor â€™til I located my shoes and the puddle of my cloak and, swinging this over my shoulders, slipped out and made my way silently through the half-dark house, past the smoldering hearth and out.

The door was unbolted and on the latch; perhaps Mr. Chenowyth was out and expected back. I supposed there was some danger of my being locked out, but at this point spending the night in the midst of a military camp in my shift seemed preferable to sleepingâ€”or, rather, not sleepingâ€”in a tomb. Besides, I was sure that one of the small Chenowyths had weeâ€™d in the bed fairly recently.

No one took any notice of me as I walked back along the road. The taverns and ordinaries were crammed full and spilling customers all over the road. Continental regulars in their blue and buff, swaggering about, the envyâ€”they hopedâ€”of the militiamen. Any number of women, too, and not all whores, by any means. But above all . . . air.

The heat of the day had largely gone, and while the air wasnâ€™t cold by any means, it wasnâ€™t stifling, either. Having escaped entombment, I reveled in the feeling of freedomâ€”and what amounted to invisibility, for tall as I was, with my cloak on and my hair tied back in a plait for bed, I looked much like many of the militiamen in the dark; no one glanced twice at me.

The street and the camp beyond were electric; I recognized the feeling, and it gave me the oddest sense of dislocationâ€”for I recognized it in its various forms from half of the battlefields Iâ€™d served near, from France in 1944 to Prestonpans and Saratoga. It wasnâ€™t always this way; often the sense of the occasion was one of dreadâ€”or worse. I remembered the night before Culloden and felt a wave of cold wash through me so strongly that I staggered and nearly fell against the wall of a building.

â€œFriend Claire?â€ said a voice, in amazement.

â€œDenzell?â€ Half-blinded by a number of torches being borne past, I blinked at the shape that had manifested before me.

â€œWhat is thee doing out here?â€ he said, alarmed. â€œIs anything wrong? Is it Jamie?â€

â€œWell, you could say itâ€™s Jamie,â€ I said, getting back my composure. â€œBut thereâ€™s nothing wrong, no. I was just getting a bit of air. What are you doing here?â€

â€œI was fetching a pitcher of beer,â€ he said, and took me firmly by the arm, steering me down the street. â€œCome with me. Thee ought not be in the street with the fighting men. Those that arenâ€™t drunk now will be shortly.â€

I didnâ€™t argue. His hand on my arm felt good, steadying me against the strange currents of the night that seemed to carry me willy-nilly into the pastâ€”and the futureâ€”and back again without warning.

â€œWhere are Rachel and Dottie?â€ I asked, as we turned right at the end of the street and began to thread our way through the campfires and rows of tents.

â€œRachelâ€™s gone somewhere with Ian; I didnâ€™t inquire. Dottieâ€™s in our medical tent, dealing with a case of acute indigestion.â€

â€œOh, dear. What did she eat?â€

He laughed softly. â€œThe indigestion isnâ€™t hers. A woman named Peabody, who came in complaining of colic pains. Dorothea said she would administer something appropriate, if I would go and fetch her some beerâ€”it being not safe for her to venture to the ordinary alone.â€

I thought I detected a small note of reproach in his voice, but I made an indeterminate â€œhmmâ€ in response and he said no more about my wandering the streets en dÃ©shabillÃ©. Possibly because he hadnâ€™t noticed that I was en dÃ©shabillÃ©, until we entered the Huntersâ€™ big medical tent and I took my cloak off.

Denny gave me one brief, shocked look, coughed, and, picking up a canvas apron, managed to hand it to me without looking directly at me. Dottie, who was massaging the massive back of a very large woman seated hunched over on a stool in front of her, grinned at me over the womanâ€™s capped head.

â€œHow are you, Auntie. Restless tonight?â€

â€œVery,â€ I replied frankly, putting on the apron. â€œThis is Mrs. Peabody?â€

â€œYes.â€ Dottie smothered a yawn with her shoulder. â€œThe indigestion seems to be betterâ€”I gave her gripe water and peppermint,â€ she added, to Denny. â€œBut sheâ€™s complaining of pains in her back, as well.â€

â€œHmm.â€ I came over and squatted down in front of the woman, who appeared to be half asleepâ€”until I caught a whiff of her breath, which was eighty proof, at least. I put my hand on her belly to see if I could feel the location of the trouble, when she coughed thickly in a way Iâ€™d heard all too often before, chokedâ€”and I leapt back just in time.

â€œThank you for the apron, Denny,â€ I said mildly, brushing off some of the higher flecks of mud and vomit that had spattered on me. â€œI donâ€™t suppose you brought a birthing stool with you?â€

â€œA birthing stool. To a battle?â€ he said faintly, his eyes bulging slightly behind his spectacles as he looked at the woman, now swaying ponderously to and fro, like a large bell making up its mind whether to ring or not.

â€œI rather think it may be one,â€ I said, glancing round. â€œIf sheâ€™s in labor. Can you find a blanket, Dottie? I think weâ€™ll have to lay her on the ground; sheâ€™ll collapse the cot.â€

It took all three of us to wrestle Mrs. Peabodyâ€”who relapsed comfortably into unconsciousness the moment we touched herâ€”onto a blanket spread on the ground under the lantern. There was an almost instant insurgence of moths, as they came fluttering in, attracted not only by the light but by the assorted smells thickening the air.

Mrs. Peabody had lapsed not merely into unconsciousness but into what appeared to be an alcoholic coma. After a certain amount of discussion, weâ€™d turned her onto one side, in case she should vomit again, and the position had allowed her belly to flow away from the rest of her corpulent body, so that it lay on the ground in front of her, gravid and sac-like. She looked like the queen of some order of social insect, ready to deliver in the thousands, but I refrained from mentioning this, as Dottie was still pale.

Denzell had recovered from the shock and was keeping an eyeâ€”or rather a handâ€”on her wrist, keeping track of her pulse. â€œAmazingly strong,â€ he said at last, letting go, and looked up at me. â€œDoes thee think she is near her time?â€

â€œI really hope not,â€ I said, looking down. â€œBut thereâ€™s no telling without . . . er . . . closer examination.â€ I took a deep breath and a grip on my more generous instincts. â€œWould you like me to . . . er . . .â€

â€œIâ€™ll go and find clean water,â€ he said, springing to his feet and seizing a bucket.

Given that Dottie was engaged to Denny, I refrained from calling him a coward in her presence and merely waved him off in a reserved manner. Mrs. Peabody made me uneasy on a number of scores. I had no idea whether she might be about to go into labor, or, if she did, how her comatose state might affect it. The level of alcohol in her blood was certainly affecting the childâ€™s; would a drunken newborn be able to breathe? It wouldnâ€™t vomit, as there wasnâ€™t anything in its stomach to vomit, but might it void its bowels in utero and aspirate the material? That was a remarkably dangerous thing to happen even in a modern hospital with a full delivery-suite staff attendingâ€”most of the babies who did that died of suffocation, lung injury, or infection.

I was very much ashamed to admit to myself that my chief fear, though, was that something would happen during delivery that would require me to remain with mother and/or child for a prolonged period. I could not, by my oath as a physicianâ€”and what I conceived my responsibilities to beâ€”abandon a patient in dire need of me.

But I would not abandon Jamie. I knew beyond all doubt that he was going into battle, and soon. He wasnâ€™t going without me.

A slight noise jerked me out of my hypothetical moral quandary. Dottie had started unpacking and had dropped an amputation saw. She stooped to pick it up and said something under her breath in German that I thought was probably a bad wordâ€”John always swore in German; perhaps it was a family habit.

Thought of John added another layer of guilt to my complicated feelingsâ€”though the logical part of my brain firmly rejected this as undeserved. Still, the worry for him couldnâ€™t be rejected so easily, though I did my best to tuck it away for the present.

â€œYou neednâ€™t stay up, Dottie,â€ I said. â€œI can take care of matters here. Nothingâ€™s going to happen immediately, regardlessâ€”I can make up the surgical kits.â€

â€œNo, thatâ€™s all right,â€ she said, and then yawned involuntarily, gaping so widely that she startled herself and clapped a hand belatedly over her mouth. â€œOh, dear. I do beg your pardon, Mrs. Fraser.â€ That made me smile; she had Johnâ€™s elegant mannersâ€”perhaps Hal did, too, when he wasnâ€™t engaging in undiluted bastardliness.

â€œActually,â€ she said, fixing me directly with her striking gaze, â€œIâ€™m pleased to have a chance to talk with you in privacy.â€

â€œOh?â€ I said, squatting to put a hand on Mrs. Peabodyâ€™s belly. I wasnâ€™t feeling any movement from the baby, but they usually did go quiet if labor was impending. I could have used my stethoscope to listen for a fetal heartbeat, but it was in one of the boxes or bags that Ian and the orderly had carried off somewhere. Besides, whatever I heard or didnâ€™t would make no difference to the immediate protocol.

â€œYes.â€ Dottie sat down on a packing case as though it were a throneâ€”like all the Greys Iâ€™d met, she had excellent posture. â€œI want to know the correct way of performing sexual intercourse.â€

â€œOh. Erm . . .â€

She glanced down at Mrs. Peabody.

â€œAnd whether there is any way of preventing . . . er . . .â€

â€œPregnancy. To be sure.â€ I cleared my throat. I rather thought the sight of Mrs. Peabody would have put most young women off the idea of childbearingâ€”if not sexâ€”altogether. Dorothea Grey, though, was plainly a young woman of blood and iron.

â€œDonâ€™t mistake me, Auntie,â€ she said earnestly. â€œOr do I mean Friend Claire? I do want childrenâ€”want them terribly. But if there is any choice about giving birth on a battlefield or a moving ship, sayâ€”â€

I seized on this last, in part to give myself time to compose something coherent in the way of advice. Iâ€™d rather thought Rachel might want to talk about such things at some point, having no mother, but . . .

â€œA ship? Are you thinking of going home to England, then?â€

She grimaced in a way that brought her father vividly before me, and I nearly laughed but fortunately didnâ€™t.

â€œI donâ€™t know. I dearly want to see Mama again, of course, and Adam . . . and my . . . well, actually, I doubt I should see any of my friends again.â€ She waved a hand, dismissing the friends. â€œNot that there arenâ€™t any Quakers in society, but theyâ€™re all very rich, and we wonâ€™t be.â€

She bit her lip, but in a way indicating calculation rather than chagrin.

â€œIf I can contrive to make Denny marry me here, so that we arrived in England as husband and wife already, it would be a simple matter to find a London meeting that would welcome us. Whereas hereâ€”â€ She flung out a hand toward the hum of the camp around us. â€œHis involvement in the war would always stand in his way, you see?â€

â€œEven after the war is over?â€

She gave me a patient look, too old for her face.

â€œPapa says that wars take three generations to fade from the ground where theyâ€™re fought. And from what Iâ€™ve seen, Friends have quite long memories, as well.â€

â€œHe might just have a point.â€ Mrs. Peabody had begun to snore wetly, but I felt no sense of contraction. I rubbed a hand through my hair and braced my back more comfortably against one of the packing crates set against the wall. â€œAll right. Perhaps . . . a little basic anatomy, to begin with.â€

I really had no idea how muchâ€”if anythingâ€”a nobly born young woman might have been told, or found out by other means, so began with female reproductive anatomy, starting with the wombâ€”for surely she knew what that wasâ€”and leading outward, part by part.

â€œYou mean it has a name?â€ she exclaimed, charmed, when I got to the clitoris. â€œIâ€™d always thought of it as just, you know . . . that bit.â€ Her tone of voice made it abundantly clear that I neednâ€™t explain what that bit did, and I laughed.

â€œTo the best of my knowledge, itâ€™s the only structure of the human body that appears to have no function whatever save the pleasure of the owner.â€

â€œBut men . . . donâ€™t they . . . ?â€

â€œWell, yes, they do,â€ I said. â€œAnd very pleasurable they find theirs, too. But a penis is extremely functional, as well. You, er . . . do know how it . . . works? In terms of intercourse?â€

â€œDenzell wonâ€™t let me touch his naked member, and Iâ€™m longing to see it at my leisureâ€”not just the odd glimpse when he, well, you know.â€ Her eyes sparkled at the thought. â€œBut I know what it feels like through his breeches. I was amazed, the first time it went stiff under my hand! However does it do that?â€

I explained the concept of hydrostatic pressure as simply as possible, already seeing what was coming next. I cleared my throat and rose to my knees.

â€œI need to examine Mrs. Peabody for any sign of labor. And while we must be respectful of her privacyâ€”so far as such a thing exists under these conditionsâ€â€”for Dottie had snorted loudlyâ€”â€œsince youâ€™re assisting me here, thereâ€™s no reason why you shouldnâ€™t observe what Iâ€™m doing, and Iâ€™ll explain it to you as we go. How things . . . work.â€

She hummed with interest as I gingerly unveiled Mrs. Peabodyâ€™s nether regions, which were thickly forested but still identifiablyâ€”very identifiablyâ€”feminine.

â€œWhen the cervixâ€”thatâ€™s the opening to the wombâ€”when it begins to open in order for the baby to come out, thereâ€™s often some blood and mucus released, but itâ€™s quite harmless. I donâ€™t see any sign of it yet, though.â€ That heartened me.

â€œOh,â€ said Dottie, rather faintly. But she leaned intently over my shoulder as I carefully inserted my freshly washed hand. â€œOh!â€ Dottie said, in tones of extreme revelation. â€œThatâ€™s where it goes!â€

â€œWell, yes, it is,â€ I said, trying not to laughâ€”and failing. â€œDenzell would have told you, I expect. Did you ask him?â€

â€œNo,â€ she said, sitting back a little on her heels but still watching closely as I put a hand on Mrs. Peabodyâ€™s abdomen and felt the cervix. Softened, but still firm. I began to breathe again.

â€œNo?â€ I said, only half-attending.

â€œNo.â€ She drew herself up. â€œI didnâ€™t want to seem ignorant. Dennyâ€™s soâ€”I mean, heâ€™s educated. I can read, of course, and write, but only letters, and play music, but thatâ€™s useless. I bustle round after him and help where I can, of course, and heâ€™s always so good about explaining things . . . but . . . well, I kept having this vision of our wedding night and him explaining it to me in just the same way heâ€™d tell me how to suck the snot out of a childâ€™s nose with a tube or hold the skin together so he could stitch a wound. And . . .â€ She made a graceful little moue, which had to be her motherâ€™s legacy. â€œAnd I made up my mind it wasnâ€™t going to be that way.â€

â€œVery . . . um . . . commendable.â€ I withdrew my hand and wiped it, re-covered Mrs. Peabody, and checked her pulse againâ€”slow, but strong as a tympani; the woman must have the heart of an ox. â€œHowâ€”erâ€”how do you want it to be? Bearing in mind,â€ I hastened to add, â€œthat this sort of thing is rather variable.â€ Another thought occurred to me. â€œHas Denzell ever . . . ? Though I donâ€™t suppose youâ€™d know.â€

Her soft white brow wrinkled in thought.

â€œI donâ€™t know; I never thought of asking him. I just assumedâ€”well, I have brothers. I know they have, because they talk about itâ€”whores, I meanâ€”with their friends. I suppose I thought all men . . . but, come to think, perhaps Denny wouldnâ€™t go to a prostitute. Do you think he might have?â€ Her brow furrowed a little, but she didnâ€™t seem upset at the thought. Of course, it was probably commonly accepted in the Greysâ€™ social circle that men, or soldiers at least, naturally would.



With very vivid memories of my own wedding nightâ€”and my stupefaction upon being informed that my bridegroom was a virginâ€”I temporized a bit.

â€œPossibly not. Now, being a medical man, plainly he must know the essential mechanics. But there is more to it than that.â€

Her eyes grew brighter and she leaned forward, hands on her knees.

â€œTell me.â€



â€œRATHER LIKE EGG white mixed with a drop or two of civet. Theoretically good for the skin, though franklyâ€”â€ I was saying, when I heard the sound of voices just outside the tent.

Rachel and Ian had returned, looking cheerful, flushed, and quite like young people who had just passed the last hour or two doing the sorts of things in which Iâ€™d been instructing Dottie. I saw her glance sideways at Rachel, thenâ€”very brieflyâ€”at Ianâ€™s breeches. Her color went up a notch.

Rachel didnâ€™t notice, her attention having fixed at once on Mrs. Peabodyâ€”well, everyoneâ€™s attention was fixed on Mrs. Peabody; it was really impossible to look at anything else. She frowned at the supine woman on the ground and then looked at me.

â€œWhereâ€™s Denzell?â€

â€œAn excellent question. He left a quarter of an hour ago to find water. Thereâ€™s beer, though, if youâ€™re thirsty.â€ I nodded at the neglected pitcher.

Ian poured a cup for Rachel, waited while she drank it, then refilled it for himself, eyes still fixed on Mrs. Peabody, who was emitting a remarkable variety of noises, though still out cold.

â€œDoes Uncle Jamie ken where ye are, Auntie?â€ he asked. â€œHe was lookinâ€™ for ye just now. He said heâ€™d put ye somewhere safe to sleep, but yeâ€™d escaped. Again,â€ he added with a broad grin.

â€œOh,â€ I said. â€œHeâ€™s finished with the generals for the night, then?â€

â€œAye, he went to make the acquaintance oâ€™ some of the militia captains under him, but most had gone to sleep by then, so he went to join ye at the Chenowyths. Mrs. Chenowyth was a bit taken aback to find ye gone,â€ he added delicately.

â€œI just came out for a little air,â€ I said, defensive. â€œAnd thenâ€”â€ I gestured at the patient on the floor, who had now settled down to a rhythmic snore. Her color was looking better; that was heartening. â€œEr . . . is Jamie put out, do you think?â€

Ian and Rachel both laughed at that.

â€œNo, Auntie,â€ Ian said. â€œBut heâ€™s dead tired, and he wants ye bad.â€

â€œDid he tell you to say that?â€

â€œNot in precisely those words,â€ Rachel said, â€œbut his meaning was plain.â€ She turned to Ian, with a quick squeeze of his arm. â€œWould thee go and find Denny, Ian? Claire canâ€™t leave this woman aloneâ€”I think?â€ she asked, arching a brow at me.

â€œNot yet,â€ I said. â€œShe doesnâ€™t seem to be going into labor immediatelyâ€â€”I crossed my fingers against the possibilityâ€”â€œbut she oughtnâ€™t to be left alone in this state.â€



â€œAye, of course.â€ Ian yawned suddenly, widely, but then shook himself back into alertness. â€œIf I come across Uncle Jamie, Iâ€™ll tell him where ye are, Auntie.â€

He left, and Rachel poured another cup of beer, which she offered me. It was room temperatureâ€”and a warm room, at thatâ€”but refreshingly sour and strong. I hadnâ€™t really thought I was tired, but the beer revivified me astonishingly.

Dottie, having checked Mrs. Peabodyâ€™s pulse and breathing, laid a ginger hand on the distended bulge of pregnancy. â€œHas thee attended a birth before, good-sister?â€ Dottie asked Rachel, being careful of her plain speech.

â€œSeveral,â€ Rachel replied, squatting down by Mrs. Peabody. â€œThis looks somewhat different, though. Has she suffered some injurâ€”oh!â€ The brewery reek hit her, and she reared back and coughed. â€œI see.â€

Mrs. Peabody uttered a loud moan and everyone stiffened. I wiped my hands on my apron, just in case. She relaxed again, though, and after a few momentsâ€™ contemplative silence to see if Mrs. Peabody would do it again, Dottie took a deep breath.

â€œMrs.â€”I mean, Friend Claire was just telling me some very interesting things. Regarding . . . er . . . what to expect on oneâ€™s wedding night.â€

Rachel looked up with interest.

â€œI should welcome any such instruction myself. I know where the . . . um . . . parts go, because Iâ€™ve seen them go there fairly frequently, butâ€”â€

â€œYou have?!?â€ Dottie gawked at her, and Rachel laughed.

â€œI have. But Ian assures me that he has more skill than the average bull or billy goat, and my observations are limited to the animal world, Iâ€™m afraid.â€ A small line showed between her brows. â€œThe woman who cared for me after the death of my parents was . . . very dutiful in informing me of my womanly obligations, but her instructions consisted largely of â€˜Spread thy legs, grit thy teeth, girl, and let him.â€™â€

I sat down on the packing case and stretched to ease my back, suppressing a groan. God knew how long it might take Ian to find Jamie among the teeming hordes. And I did hope that Denny hadnâ€™t been knocked on the head or trampled by a mule.

â€œPour me another cup of beer, will you? And have some more yourselves. I suspect we may need it.â€



â€œ. . . and if he says, â€˜Oh, God, oh, God,â€™ at some point,â€ I advised, â€œtake note of what you were just doing, so you can do it again next time.â€

Rachel laughed, but Dottie frowned a little, looking slightly cross-eyed.

â€œDo youâ€”does theeâ€”think Denny would take the Lordâ€™s name in vain, even under those circumstances?â€

â€œIâ€™ve heard him do it on much less provocation than that,â€ Rachel assured her, stifling a burp with the back of her hand. â€œHe tries to be perfect in thy company, thee knows, for fear thee will change thy mind.â€

â€œHe does?â€ Dottie looked surprised but rather pleased. â€œOh. I wouldnâ€™t, thee knows. Ought I to tell him?â€



â€œNot until he says, â€˜Oh, God, oh, God,â€™ for thee,â€ Rachel said, succumbing to a giggle.

â€œI wouldnâ€™t worry,â€ I said. â€œIf a man says, â€˜Oh, God,â€™ in that situation, he nearly always means it as a prayer.â€

Dottieâ€™s fair brows drew together in concentration.

â€œA prayer of desperation? Or gratitude?â€

â€œWell . . . thatâ€™s up to you,â€ I said, and stifled a small belch of my own.

Approaching male voices outside the tent made us all glance self-consciously at the empty beer pitcher and sit up straight, poking at our slightly disheveled hair, but none of the gentlemen who came in were in any condition to cast stones.

Ian had found Denzell and Jamie, and somewhere along the way they had acquired a small, stout companion in a cocked hat, with his hair in a stumpy pigtail. All of them were flushed and, while certainly not staggering, were surrounded by a distinct haze of fermented barleycorn.

â€œThere ye are, Sassenach!â€ Jamie brightened still further at seeing me, and I felt a small rush of delight at it. â€œAre yeâ€”whoâ€™s this?â€ He had been advancing toward me, hand outstretched, but stopped abruptly at sight of Mrs. Peabody, who was lying with her arms flung out, mouth wide open.

â€œThatâ€™s the lady I told ye about, Uncle Jamie.â€ Ian wasnâ€™t staggering, either, but was distinctly swaying and took hold of the tent pole to steady himself. â€œThe one thatâ€™s . . . ehm . . .â€ He gestured with his free hand to the gentleman in the cocked hat. â€œSheâ€™s his wife.â€

â€œOh? Aye, I see.â€ He edged gingerly around Mrs. Peabodyâ€™s recumbent form. â€œSheâ€™s no dead, is she?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said. â€œI think I would have noticed.â€ He might have been somewhat inebriated, but still caught the faint dubious emphasis Iâ€™d placed on â€œthink.â€ He knelt down carefully and put a hand in front of her open mouth.

â€œNay, only drunk,â€ he said cheerfully. â€œShall we lend ye a hand to take her home, Mr. Peabody?â€

â€œBetter lend him a wheelbarrow,â€ Dottie whispered to Rachel, beside me, but luckily no one noticed.

â€œThat would be kindly of you, sir.â€ Surprisingly, Mr. Peabody appeared to be the only sober one of the lot. He knelt and smoothed the damp hair tenderly off his wifeâ€™s brow. â€œLulu? Wake up, darling. Time to be going now.â€

To my surprise, she opened her eyes and, after blinking several times in confusion, appeared to fix her gaze on her husband.

â€œThere you are, Simon!â€ she said, and, with a rapturous smile, fell soundly back asleep.

Jamie rose slowly, and I could hear the small bones in his back pop as he eased himself. He was still flushed and smiling, but Ian had been rightâ€”he was dead tired. I could see the deep lines of weariness in his face and the hollows under his bones.

Ian saw them, too.

â€œAuntie Claireâ€™s in need of her bed, Uncle Jamie,â€ he said, squeezing Jamieâ€™s shoulder and giving me a meaning look. â€œItâ€™s been a long night for her. Take her along, aye? Denny and I can help Mr. Peabody.â€

Jamie gave his nephew a sharp look and then turned the same look on me, but I obligingly yawned widely enough to make my jaw crackâ€”no great effortâ€”and with a final quick look at Mrs. Peabody to be sure she was neither dying nor going into labor, I took his arm and towed him determinedly outside, waving briefly in farewell.

Outside, we both drew deep breaths of fresh air, sighed in unison, and laughed.

â€œIt has been rather a long night, hasnâ€™t it?â€ I put my forehead against his chest and my arms around him, slowly rubbing the knobs of his vertebrae through his coat. â€œWhat happened?â€

He sighed again and kissed the top of my head.

â€œIâ€™ve command of ten companies of mixed militia from Pennyslvania and New Jersey; the marquis has command of a thousand menâ€”including mineâ€”and is in charge of a plan to go and bite the British army in the arse.â€

â€œSounds like fun.â€ The racket of the camp had died down considerably, but the thick air still held the vibrations of many men, awake or uneasily asleep. I thought I could feel that same expectant vibration pass through Jamie, in spite of his obvious tiredness. â€œYou need sleep, then.â€

His arm tightened round me and his free hand traveled slowly down my back. Iâ€™d left Dennyâ€™s apron in the tent, and my cloak was over my arm; the thin muslin of my shift might as well have not existed.

â€œOh, God,â€ he said, and his big, warm hand cupped my buttock with a sudden urgency. â€œI need you, Sassenach. I need ye bad.â€

The shift was just as thin in front as in back; I could feel his waistcoat buttonsâ€”and a few other thingsâ€”through it. He did want me bad.

â€œDo you mind doing it in a crypt that smells of wee?â€ I asked, thinking of the Chenowythsâ€™ back bedroom.

â€œIâ€™ve taken ye in worse places, Sassenach.â€

Before I could say, â€œName three,â€ the tent flap opened to disgorge a small procession, this consisting of Denzell, Dottie, Rachel, and Ian, each couple carrying one end of a canvas sheet on which lay the protuberant form of Mrs. Peabody. Mr. Peabody led the way, lantern held high.

We were standing in shadow, and they passed without noticing us, the girls giggling at the occasional stumble, the young men grunting with effort, and Mr. Peabody calling out encouragement as they made their laborious way through the darkness, presumably heading for the Peabody abode.

The tent stood before us, dark and invitingly empty.

â€œAye?â€

â€œOh, yes.â€

The stretcher bearers had taken the lantern, and the setting moon was the barest sliver above the horizon; the inside of the tent was filled with a soft, dusty black that rose up around us in a fragrantly alcoholic cloudâ€”with a faint tang of vomitâ€”when we stepped inside.

I recalled exactly where things were, though, and we managed to push together four of the packing crates. I spread my cloak on these, he took off his coat and waistcoat, and we lay down precariously in the beery dark together.

â€œHow long do you think we have?â€ I asked, undoing his flies. His flesh was warm and hard under my hand, and his skin there soft as polished silk.

â€œLong enough,â€ he said, and brushed my nipple with his thumb, slowly, in spite of his own apparent urgency. â€œDinna hurry yourself, Sassenach. Thereâ€™s no telling when weâ€™ll have the chance again.â€

He kissed me lingeringly, his mouth tasting of Roquefort and port. I could feel the vibration of the camp here, tooâ€”it ran through both of us like a fiddle string pegged tight.

â€œI dinna think Iâ€™ve got time to make ye scream, Sassenach,â€ he whispered in my ear. â€œBut Iâ€™ve maybe time to make ye moan?â€

â€œWell, possibly. Itâ€™s some time â€™til dawn, isnâ€™t it?â€

Whether it was the beer and premarital explanations, the late hour and lure of secrecyâ€”or only Jamie himself and our increasing need to shut out the world and know only each otherâ€”he had time, and to spare.

â€œOh, God,â€ he said at last, and came down slowly on me, his heart beating heavy against my ribs. â€œOh . . . God.â€

I felt my own pulse throb in hands and bones and center, but couldnâ€™t manage any response more eloquent than a faint â€œOoh.â€ After a bit, though, I recovered enough to stroke his hair.

â€œWeâ€™ll go home again soon,â€ I whispered to him. â€œAnd have all the time in the world.â€

That got me a softly affirmative Scottish noise, and we lay there for a bit longer, not wanting to come apart and get dressed, though the packing cases were hard and the possibility of discovery increasing with each passing minute.

At last he stirred, but not to rise.

â€œOh, God,â€ he said softly, in another tone altogether. â€œThree hundred men.â€ And held me tighter.





STINKING PAPIST

THE SUN WASNâ€™T YET above the horizon, but the horse park was busy as an anthill, full of grooms, foragers, teamsters, and farriers, all scurrying about their business in an incongruous soft pink light filled with the sound of hundreds of pairs of steadily champing jaws. William picked up the bay geldingâ€™s hoof and held out his hand for the hoof pick his new, small groom was clutching nervously to his chest.

â€œNow, come here, Zeb,â€ he said coaxingly. â€œIâ€™ll show you how itâ€™s done; thereâ€™s nothing to it.â€



â€œYes, sir.â€ Zebedee Jeffers edged an inch closer, eyes flicking back and forth from the hoof to the towering mass of horseflesh. Jeffers did not like horses. He particularly didnâ€™t like Visigoth. William thought it was just as well that Zeb likely didnâ€™t know what a Visigoth was.

â€œAll right. See there?â€ He tapped the pick against the shadow: the edge of a small rock that had trapped itself under the curve of the iron shoe during the night. â€œItâ€™s only a little one, but it feels just like a pebble in your own shoe would feel, and heâ€™ll go lame if we donâ€™t take care of it. Here, itâ€™s not stuck fast; do you want to try?â€

â€œNo, sir,â€ Zeb said honestly. Zebedee came from the shore of Maryland and knew about oysters, boats, and fish. Not horses.

â€œHe wonâ€™t hurt you,â€ William said, with a touch of impatience. Heâ€™d be riding back and forth along the columns a dozen times a day, carrying dispatches and gathering reports; both his horses needed to be kept ready, his regular groom, Colenso Baragwanath, was down with a fever, and he hadnâ€™t time to find another servant.

â€œYes, he will. Sir,â€ Zeb added as an afterthought. â€œSee?â€ He held out a scrawny arm, displaying what was undoubtedly a festering bite mark.

William suppressed the urge to ask what the devil the boy had been doing to the horse. Visigoth wasnâ€™t a bad-tempered horse on the whole, but he could be irritable, and Zebâ€™s nervous fidgeting was enough to try anyone, let alone a tired and hungry horse.

â€œAll right,â€ he said with a sigh, and pried the rock loose with one sharp dig. â€œBetter, then?â€ he said to the horse, running a hand down the leg and then patting Gothâ€™s flank. He felt in his pocket and drew out a bunch of limp carrots, bought the night before from a farmwoman whoâ€™d come through camp with baskets of produce on a yoke across her broad shoulders.

â€œHere. Give him that; make friends with him,â€ he suggested, handing a carrot to Zeb. â€œHold it flat on your hand.â€ Before the boy could extend this putative olive branch, though, the horse reached down and snatched it from his fingers with an audible crunch of big yellow teeth. The boy uttered a small shriek and took several steps back, collided with a bucket, and fell over it, arse over teakettle.

Torn between annoyance and an unseemly urge to laugh, William smothered both and went to pick his groom out of a manure pile.

â€œTell you what,â€ he said, dusting the boy off with a firm hand, â€œyou see that all my dunnage is aboard the baggage wagon, see if Colenso needs anything, and make sure thereâ€™s something for me to eat tonight. Iâ€™ll ask Sutherlandâ€™s groom to tend the horses.â€

Zeb sagged with relief.

â€œThank you, sir!â€

â€œAnd go see one of the surgeons and have that arm tended to!â€ William shouted after him, above the rising sound of braying and whickering. The boyâ€™s shoulders rose up around his ears and he walked faster, pretending he hadnâ€™t heard.

William saddled Goth himselfâ€”he always did, not trusting anyone else to check tack that his life might depend onâ€”then left him with his other horse, Madras, and went to find Lord Sutherlandâ€™s groom. Despite the bustle, he had no trouble finding the string; Sutherland had ten horses, all prime creatures of sixteen hands or so, and at least a dozen grooms to tend them. William was just concluding negotiations with one of these when he caught sight of a familiar face among the throng.

â€œShit,â€ he said, under his breath, but Captain Richardson had seen him and was coming toward him, smiling genially.

â€œCaptain Lord Ellesmere. Your servant, sir.â€

â€œYours, sir,â€ William said, as pleasantly as he could. What did the scoundrel want now? he wondered. Not that Richardson was a scoundrelâ€”or not necessarily one, despite Randallâ€™s warning. It might, after all, be Randall who was the scoundrel. But he did hold rather a grudge against Richardson, on Mother Claireâ€™s account, as well as his own. The thought of Mother Claire stabbed him unexpectedly, and he forced it back. None of it was her fault.

â€œIâ€™m surprised to see you here, your lordship,â€ Richardson said, glancing round at the roiling camp. The sun was up, and bands of gold lit the fog of dust rising from the mulesâ€™ rough coats. â€œYou are a conventioneer, are you not?â€

â€œI am,â€ William said coldly. Richardson certainly knew he was. William felt obliged to defend himself, though against what, he wasnâ€™t sure. â€œI cannot fight.â€ He spread his arms slightly. â€œAs you see, I carry no weapons.â€ He made polite motions indicating his immediate need to be elsewhere, but Richardson went on standing there, smiling with that very ordinary face, so unremarkable that his own mother probably couldnâ€™t pick him out of a crowd, save for a large brown mole on the side of his chin.

â€œAh, to be sure.â€ Richardson drew a little closer, lowering his voice. â€œThat being the case . . . I wonder whetherâ€”â€

â€œNo,â€ William said definitely. â€œI am one of General Clintonâ€™s aides, and I cannot leave my duty. You will excuse me, sir; I am expected.â€

He turned on his heel and made off, his heart hammeringâ€”and realized rather belatedly that he had left his horse behind. Richardson was still standing at the far side of the horse park, talking to a groom who was taking down the pickets, coiling the rope around one shoulder as he did so. The crowd of horses and mules was swiftly diminishing, but there were enough still near Visigoth to enable William to duck in and pretend to be fiddling with his saddlebags, head bent to hide his face until Richardson should go away.

The conversation had left him with an unsettling image of his erstwhile stepmother as he had last seen her, disheveled and en dÃ©shabillÃ© but glowing with a radiant life he had never seen. He didnâ€™t suppose she was his stepmother anymore, but heâ€™d liked her. Belatedly, it occurred to him that Claire now-Fraser still was his stepmotherâ€”by a different father. . . . Bloody hell.

He set his teeth, rummaging in the saddlebag for his canteen. Now that that Scotch bugger had returned from his watery grave, throwing everything and everyone into confusion . . . why couldnâ€™t he have drowned and never come back?

Never come back.

â€œYou are a stinking Papist, and your baptismal name is James.â€ He froze as though shot in the back. He bloody remembered it. The stables at Helwater, the warm smell of horses and mash, and the prickle of straw that worked its way through his stockings. Cold stone floors. Heâ€™d been crying . . . Why? All he recalled was a huge wash of desolation, total helplessness. The end of the world. Mac leaving.

He took a long, slow breath and pressed his lips together. Mac. The word didnâ€™t bring back a face; he couldnâ€™t remember what Mac had looked like. Heâ€™d been big, that was all. Bigger than Grandfather or any of the footmen or the other grooms. Safety. A sense of constant happiness like a soft, worn blanket.

â€œShit,â€ he whispered, closing his eyes. And had that happiness been a lie, too? Heâ€™d been too little to know the difference between a groomâ€™s deference to the young master and real kindness. But . . .

â€œâ€˜You are a stinking Papist,â€™â€ he whispered, and caught his breath on something that might have been a sob. â€œ â€˜And your baptismal name is James.â€™â€

â€œIt was the only name I had a right to give ye.â€

He realized that his knuckles were pressed against his chest, against his gorgetâ€”but it wasnâ€™t the gorgetâ€™s reassurance that he sought. It was that of the little bumps of the plain wooden rosary that heâ€™d worn around his neck for years, hidden under his shirt where no one would see it. The rosary Mac had given him . . . along with his name.

With a suddenness that shocked him, he felt his eyes swim. You went away. You left me!

â€œShit!â€ he said, and punched his fist so hard into the saddlebag that the horse snorted and shied, and a bolt of white-hot pain shot up his arm, obliterating everything.





DO NOT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT

IAN WOKE JUST BEFORE dawn to find his uncle squatting beside him.

â€œIâ€™m away to break bread wiâ€™ the captains of my companies,â€ Jamie said without preamble. â€œYeâ€™ll report to Colonel Wilbur as a scout. And will ye see about horses, Ian? Iâ€™ll need a spare mount, gun-broke, and so will you.â€ He dropped a purse on Ianâ€™s chest, smiled, and vanished into the morning mist.

Ian rolled slowly out of his blanket, stretching. Heâ€™d chosen his resting spot well away from the main camp, on a small rise of ground near the river. He didnâ€™t bother wondering how Uncle Jamie had found him, or waste time in marveling at his uncleâ€™s recuperative powers.

He took his time about his preparations, dressed carefully, and found some food, thinking over the things that must be done. Heâ€™d dreamed during the night, and the dream was still on him, though he couldnâ€™t recall the details. Heâ€™d been in thick woods, and something was there with him, hiding among the leaves. He wasnâ€™t sure what it was, or even if heâ€™d seen it, but the sense of danger lingered uneasily between his shoulder blades. Heâ€™d heard a raven calling in his dream, and that was certainly a warning of some kindâ€”but then the raven had flown past him, and it wasnâ€™t a raven at all but a white bird of some kind. Its wing had touched his cheek in flight, and he could still feel the brush of its feathers.

White animals were messengers. Both the Mohawk and the Highlanders said so.

He was an Indian and a Highlander; dreams were not to be dismissed. Sometimes the meaning of a dream floated to the surface of your mind like a drowned leaf rising. He let it go, hoping the dream would return to explain itself, and went about his work, seeing Colonel Wilbur, finding and haggling for two reasonable horses, big enough to bear a large man through battle . . . but the white bird stayed by him all day long, hovering just above his right shoulder, a glimpse now and then in the corner of his eye.



IN THE LATE afternoon, his business done for the moment, he returned to the main camp and found Rachel standing in line with a number of other women at the well in the yard of the Goose and Grapes, two buckets resting at her feet.

â€œI could take those down to the river for ye,â€ he offered. She was flushed with the heat of the day but looked beautiful, her bare arms brown and the curving muscle of them so neat and delicate that it lifted his heart to look at them.

â€œI thank thee, Ian, but no.â€ She smiled up at him and reached to tweak one of the two eagle feathers heâ€™d knotted into his hair. â€œThy auntie says the boats throw their waste into the river, and half the army is pissing in it, as well, and sheâ€™s right. I should need to walk a mile upstream to find a clean place from which to draw water. Is thee about thy business, then?â€

She spoke with interest but with no sense of concern or disapproval, and he appreciated that.

â€œI willna kill anyone unless I have to, Rachel,â€ he said softly, and touched her cheek. â€œIâ€™m signed on as a scout. I shouldna have to.â€

â€œBut things happen,â€ she said, and looked away, to keep him seeing the sudden shadow in her eyes. â€œI know.â€

With an unexpected spurt of impatience, he wanted to ask her: would she rather he kill or be killed for the sake of his soulâ€™s grace? But he smothered the impulse, and the tinge of anger with it. She loved him, he didnâ€™t doubt that. It was maybe a fair question to put to a Quaker, but not to his betrothed.



Her eyes were on his face, interested and thoughtful, and he felt a slight flush rise in his cheeks, wondering just how much of his thoughts showed.

â€œThy lifeâ€™s journey lies along its own path, Ian,â€ she said, â€œand I cannot share thy journeyâ€”but I can walk beside thee. And I will.â€

The woman standing behind them in the line heaved a deep, contented sigh.

â€œNow, thatâ€™s a very pretty and right thing to say, sweetheart,â€ she said to Rachel, in approving tones. And, switching her gaze to Ian, looked him skeptically up and down. He was dressed in buckskins, clout, and calico shirt, and, bar the feathers in his hair and the tattoos, didnâ€™t look too outlandish, he thought.

â€œYou probably donâ€™t deserve her,â€ the woman said, shaking her head doubtfully. â€œBut try, thereâ€™s a good lad.â€



HE CARRIED THE water for Rachel, making their way through the sprawl of the camp toward the place where Denzell had set up his medical practice. The tent was still standing, but Denzellâ€™s wagon with its painted goldfinches on the tailboard was drawn up beside it, Dottie standing in it, and Denzell handing up parcels and boxes to her.

Rachel stood on tiptoe to kiss his cheek, then vanished into the tent to help with the packing.

â€œWilt thee join us later, Ian?â€ Denny looked up from the pack he was strapping together.

â€œAnywhere, a bhrÃ thair,â€ Ian said, smiling. â€œWhere are ye bound, then?â€

â€œOh. Nowhere.â€ Denny took off his spectacles, polishing them absently on the tail of his shirt. â€œItâ€™s not yet First Day, but we may well be engaged in battle then; we thought to hold meeting before supper tonight. We would be pleased if thee feels it good to sit with us, but if not . . .â€

â€œNo, Iâ€™ll come,â€ Ian said quickly. â€œTo be sure. Ah . . . where . . . ?â€ He waved a hand vaguely, indicating the half-ordered chaos of the camp surrounding them. New companies of militia were still coming in from New Jersey and Pennsylvania to join the Continental soldiers, and while officers had been assigned to receive and organize these and help them find campgrounds, they were swiftly overwhelmed. Men were making camp anywhere they could find open ground, and there was great to-ing and fro-ing in search of water and food, arguments and raised voices, and the sound of industrious shoveling and muttered curses nearby indicated the creation of yet another set of sanitary trenches. A constant small procession of persons who couldnâ€™t wait visited a nearby copse in hopes of a private moment. Ian made a mental note to step wary if he walked that way.

â€œYe dinna mean to do it here, surely?â€ People came in and out all day, in need of the doctorâ€™s attention, and wouldnâ€™t be likely to stop, only because meeting was being held.

â€œFriend Jamie says he will provide us a refuge,â€ Denny assured him. â€œWeâ€™ll go as soon asâ€”who has thee there, Dorothea?â€

Dottie was stowing supplies but had paused to talk with a young girl who had climbed up to kneel on the wagonâ€™s seat and was addressing Dorothea earnestly.

â€œItâ€™s a woman in childbed, Denny,â€ she called. â€œThree campfires over!â€

â€œUrgent?â€ Denny at once began unstrapping the pack he had just done up.

â€œThis child says so.â€ Dottie straightened up and tucked her straggling fair hair back under her cap. â€œItâ€™s her motherâ€™s fourth; no trouble with the first three, but given the conditions . . .â€ She sidled past the baggage to the lowered tailboard, and Ian gave her a hand to hop down.

â€œShe really wanted Mrs. Fraser,â€ Dottie said to Denny, sotto voce. â€œBut sheâ€™ll settle for you.â€ She dimpled. â€œIs thee flattered?â€

â€œI see my reputation spreads like pomade on a silken pillow,â€ he replied tranquilly. â€œAnd thy use of plain speech inflames me. Thee had best come with me. Will thee watch the wagon, Ian?â€

The two of them made off through the maze of wagons, horses, and stray pigsâ€”some enterprising farmer had driven a dozen lean hogs into camp, seeking to sell them to the quartermaster, but the pigs had taken fright at the inadvertent explosion of a musket nearby and run off among the crowd, causing mass confusion. Rollo had run one down and broken its neck; Ian had bled and eviscerated the carcass andâ€”after giving Rollo the heart and lightsâ€”stashed it under damp canvas, hidden beneath Denzellâ€™s wagon. Should he meet the distraught swineherd, heâ€™d pay him for the beast, but he wasnâ€™t letting it out of his sight. He stole a quick glance under the skirting board, but the canvas-covered lump was still there.

Rollo moved a little and made an odd sound, not quite a whine, that shifted Ianâ€™s attention at once to the dog.

â€œHow is it, a choin?â€ he asked. Rollo at once licked his hand and panted in a genial fashion, but Ian slid off the wagon tongue and knelt in the leaves, feeling his way over the big, shaggy body, just in case. Palpating, Auntie Claire called it, a word that always made Ian smile.

He found a little tenderness where the dog had been shot the autumn before, in the meat of the shoulder just above the foreleg, but that was always there. And a spot on his spine, a few inches forward of the beastâ€™s tail, that made him splay his legs and groan when it was pressed. Maybe Rollo had strained himself taking down the hog.

â€œNone sae young as ye used to be, are ye, a choin?â€ he asked, scratching Rolloâ€™s whitened jaw.

â€œNone of us are, a mac mo pheathar,â€ said his uncle Jamie, coming out of the gloaming and sitting down on the stump Dottie had been using to mount the wagon. He was wearing full uniform and looked hot. Ian passed over his canteen and Jamie took it with a nod of thanks, wiping his sleeve across his face.

â€œAye, day after tomorrow,â€ he said, in answer to Ianâ€™s raised brow. â€œFirst light, if not before. Wee Gilbertâ€™s got command of a thousand men and permission to go after the rear guard.â€

â€œYouâ€”I mean usâ€â€”Ian corrected himselfâ€”â€œwith him?â€

Jamie nodded and drank deep. Ian thought he looked a bit tense, but, after all, he was in command of three hundred menâ€”if all of them were going with La Fayette . . .



â€œI think theyâ€™re sending me with him in hopes that my ancient wisdom will balance the Seigneur de La Fayetteâ€™s youthful enthusiasm,â€ Jamie said, lowering the canteen with a sigh. â€œAnd itâ€™s maybe better than staying back wiâ€™ Lee.â€ He grimaced. â€œBoiling Water thinks it beneath his dignity to marshal no but a thousand men and declined the command.â€

Ian made a noise indicating amusement at this and faith in his uncleâ€™s sagacity. It might be fun, harrying the British rear. He felt a tingle of anticipation at thought of putting on his war paint.

â€œWhereâ€™s Denzell gone?â€ Jamie asked, glancing at the wagon.

â€œAttending a childbirth over yon,â€ Ian said, lifting his chin in the direction Denzell and Dottie had taken. â€œHe says yeâ€™re hosting a Quaker meeting tonight.â€

Jamie lifted a thick brow glistening with droplets of sweat.

â€œWell, I wasna planning to join in, but I said they might use my tent and welcome. Why, are ye going yourself?â€

â€œThought I might,â€ Ian said. â€œI was invited, after all.â€

â€œWere ye?â€ Jamie looked interested. â€œDâ€™ye think they mean to convert ye?â€

â€œI dinna think thatâ€™s how Quakers work,â€ Ian said, a little ruefully. â€œAnd good luck to them if they do. I think the power oâ€™ prayer must have limits.â€

That made his uncle snort with amusement, but Jamie shook his head. â€œNever think it, laddie,â€ he advised. â€œIf wee Rachel sets her mind to it, sheâ€™ll have your sword beaten into a plowshare before ye can say Peter Piper picked a peck oâ€™ pickled peppers. Well, twice,â€ he added. â€œOr maybe three times.â€

Ian made a dissentient noise through his nose. â€œAye, and if I were to try beinâ€™ a Friend, who would there be to protect the lot of â€™em? Rachel and her brother and Dottie, I mean. Ye ken that, donâ€™t ye? That they can only be what they are because you and I are what we are?â€

Jamie leaned back a little, purse-lipped, then gave him the ghost of a wry smile.

â€œI ken that fine. And so does Denzell Hunter; itâ€™s why heâ€™s here, though itâ€™s cost him his home and his meeting. But, mind, theyâ€™re worth protectingâ€”beyond you beinâ€™ in love wiâ€™ Rachel, I mean.â€

â€œMmphm.â€ Ian wasnâ€™t in the mood to discuss philosophy, and he doubted his uncle was, either. The light was in that long hour before darkfall, when the things of the forest pause and draw breath, slowing for the night. It was a good time to hunt, because the trees slowed first, so you saw the animals still moving among them.

Uncle Jamie kent that. He sat, relaxed, nothing moving save his eyes. Ian saw his gaze flick up and turned his own head to see. Sure enough, a squirrel clung to the trunk of a sycamore, ten feet away. Heâ€™d not have seen it, had he not caught the last flick of its tail as it stilled there. He met Jamieâ€™s eyes, and they both smiled and sat silent for a while, listening to the racket of the camp, even this beginning to mute itself.

Denzell and Dottie hadnâ€™t come back; perhaps the birth was more complicated than Denny had thought. Rachel would be going to Jamieâ€™s tent soon, for the meeting.

He wondered about that. You needed a meeting, to counsel the two of you, then to approve and witness the marriage. Might Denny have it in his mind to establish a new Friends meeting, within which he could marry Dottieâ€”and Rachel might wed Ian?

Jamie sighed and stirred, getting ready to rise.

â€œAhh . . . Uncle,â€ Ian said, in a casual tone that made his uncle instantly focus attention on him.

â€œWhat?â€ said his uncle warily. â€œYe havena got your lass wiâ€™ child, have ye?â€

â€œI have not,â€ Ian said, offendedâ€”and wondering vaguely how his uncle had known he was thinking of Rachel. â€œAnd why would ye think a thing like that, ye evil-minded auld mumper?â€

â€œBecause I ken well enough what â€˜Ahh . . . Uncleâ€™ usually means,â€ Jamie informed him cynically. â€œIt means yeâ€™ve got yourself into some confusion involving a lass and want advice. And I canna think what ye could be confused about wiâ€™ regard to wee Rachel. A more straightforward lass Iâ€™ve never metâ€”bar your auntie Claire, that is,â€ he added, with a brief grin.

â€œMmphm,â€ Ian said, not best pleased by his uncleâ€™s acuity, but obliged to admit the truth of it. â€œWell, then. Itâ€™s only . . .â€ Despite the completely benign intentâ€”the innocence, evenâ€”of the question that had come into his mind, he felt his face go hot.

Jamie raised his brows.

â€œWell, if ye must know, thenâ€”Iâ€™ve never lain wiâ€™ a virgin.â€ Once heâ€™d got it out, he relaxed a little, though his uncleâ€™s brows nearly met his hairline. â€œAnd, aye, Iâ€™m sure Rachel is one,â€ he added defensively.

â€œIâ€™m sure, too,â€ his uncle assured him. â€œMost men wouldna consider it a problem.â€

Ian gave him a look. â€œYe ken what I mean. I want her to like it.â€

â€œVerra commendable. Have ye had complaints from women before?â€

â€œYeâ€™re in a rare mood, Uncle,â€ Ian said coldly. â€œYe ken verra well what I mean.â€

â€œAye, ye mean if yeâ€™re paying a woman to bed ye, yeâ€™re no likely to hear anything ye dinna like regarding your own performance.â€ Jamie rocked back a little, eyeing him. â€œDid ye tell Rachel yeâ€™re in the habit of consorting wiâ€™ whores?â€

Ian felt the blood rush to his ears and was obliged to breathe evenly for a moment before replying.

â€œI told her everything,â€ he said between clenched teeth. â€œAnd I wouldna call it a â€˜habit.â€™â€ He did know better than to go on with, â€œItâ€™s no more than other men do,â€ because he kent fine what sort of answer heâ€™d get to that.

Fortunately, Jamie seemed to have reined in his jocularity for the moment and was considering the question.

â€œYour Mohawk wife,â€ he said delicately. â€œShe, er . . .â€

â€œNo,â€ Ian said. â€œThe Indians see bedding a bit differently.â€ And, seizing the opportunity to get a bit of his own back, added, â€œDâ€™ye not recall the time we went to visit the Snowbird Cherokee and Bird sent a couple of maidens to warm your bed?â€

Jamie gave him an old-fashioned sort of look that made him laugh.

â€œTell me, Ian,â€ he said, after a pause, â€œwould ye be having this conversation with your da?â€



â€œGod, no.â€

â€œIâ€™m flattered,â€ Jamie said dryly.

â€œWell, see . . .â€ Ian had answered by reflex and found himself fumbling for an explanation. â€œItâ€”I mean . . . itâ€™s no that I wouldna talk to Da about things, but if heâ€™d told me anything about . . . it would haâ€™ been to do with him and Mam, wouldnâ€™t it? And I couldna . . . well, I couldnâ€™t, thatâ€™s all.â€

â€œMmphm.â€

Ian narrowed his eyes at his uncle.

â€œYeâ€™re no going to try and tell me that my motherâ€”â€

â€œWhoâ€™s my sister, aye? No, I wouldna tell ye anything like that. I see your point. Iâ€™m only thinkinâ€™ . . .â€ He trailed off and Ian gave him a pointed look. The light was fading, but there was still plenty. Jamie shrugged.

â€œAye, well. Itâ€™s onlyâ€”your auntie Claire was widowed when I wed her, aye?â€

â€œAye. So?â€

â€œSo it was me that was virgin on our wedding night.â€

Ian hadnâ€™t thought heâ€™d moved, but Rollo jerked his head up and looked at him, startled. Ian cleared his throat.

â€œOh. Aye?â€

â€œAye,â€ said his uncle, wry as a lemon. â€œAnd I was given any amount of advice beforehand, too, by my uncle Dougal and his men.â€

Dougal MacKenzie had died before Ian was born, but heâ€™d heard a good bit about the man, one way and another. His mouth twitched.

â€œWould ye care to pass on any of it?â€

â€œGod, no.â€ Jamie stood up and brushed bits of bark from the tails of his coat. â€œI think ye already ken ye should be gentle about it, aye?â€

â€œAye, Iâ€™d thought of that,â€ Ian assured him. â€œNothing else?â€

â€œAye, well.â€ Jamie stood still, considering. â€œThe only useful thing was what my wife told me on the night. â€˜Go slowly and pay attention.â€™ I think ye canna go far wrong wiâ€™ that.â€ He settled his coat on his shoulders. â€œOidhche mhath, Ian. Iâ€™ll see ye at first lightâ€”if not somewhat before.â€

â€œOidhche mhath, Uncle Jamie.â€

As Jamie reached the edge of the clearing, Ian called after him.

â€œUncle Jamie!â€

Jamie turned to look over his shoulder.

â€œAye?â€

â€œAnd was she gentle with ye?â€

â€œGod, no,â€ Jamie said, and grinned broadly.





CASTRAMETATION

THE SUN WAS LOW in the sky by the time William reached Clintonâ€™s camp, and lower still before heâ€™d turned Goth over to Sutherlandâ€™s grooms. Zeb was nowhere in sight. Perhaps he was with Colenso.

He delivered his cartouche of dispatches to Captain von Munchausen, saw the company clerk, and found the tent he shared with two other young captains, both of the 27th Foot. Randolph Merbling was sitting outside, reading by the last of the sun, but there was no sign of Thomas Evansâ€”nor of Colenso Baragwanath. Nor of Zebedee Jeffers. Nor of Williamâ€™s baggage.

He breathed for a moment, then shook himself like a dog shedding water. He was so tired of being angry that he just couldnâ€™t be arsed anymore. He shrugged, borrowed a towel from Merbling, washed his face, and went to find a bite to eat.

Heâ€™d made up his mind not to think about anything whatever until heâ€™d had some food and largely succeeded, letting roast chicken, bread, cheese, and beer fill at least some of his empty spaces. As he finished, though, a sudden sharp image punctured his pleasant digestive reverie. A flushed, pretty face, with wary eyes the exact color of the cider he was drinking.

Jane. Bloody hell! What with one thing and another, heâ€™d quite forgotten the whore and her sister. Heâ€™d told them to meet him at the surgeonâ€™s tent at sundown. . . . Well, the sun wasnâ€™t down yet. He was on his feet and on his way, but then had a second thought and, going back to the cook, wangled a couple of loaves and some cheese, just in case.

Castrametation was the science of laying out a proper military camp. Drainage, sanitary trenches, where to put the powder depot to avoid flooding if it rained . . . Heâ€™d had a brief course in it once. Heâ€™d likely never need to do it himself, but it did help in locating things, if you knew where they were supposed to be. And when in camp, the hospital was meant to be on the opposite side from command headquarters, close to water but on a height, if one was available.

One was, and he found the large green-canvas tent without difficulty. Could have found it with his eyes closed. Surgeons carried the smell of their work around with them, and the whiff of dried blood and the uneasy tang of sickness and recent death were perceptible at a hundred yards. It was worseâ€”much worseâ€”after a battle, but there was always illness and accident, and the stink lingered even on peaceful days, aggravated now by the muggy heat that lay like a wet blanket over the camp.



There were men, and not a few women, clustered round the tent, waiting for attention. He gave them a quick glance, but didnâ€™t see Jane. His heart had sped up a little at thought of seeing her, and he felt unaccountably disappointed. No reason why, he told himself. She and her sister would be nothing but trouble to him. They must have grown tired waiting, andâ€”

â€œYouâ€™re very late, my lord,â€ said an accusatory voice at his elbow, and he whirled round to see her looking down her nose at himâ€”as well as someone who was shorter than he could do, which wasnâ€™t very well. He found himself smiling down at her, absurdly.

â€œI said sundown,â€ he replied mildly, nodding toward the west, where a thin slice of brilliance still glowed through the trees. â€œNot down yet, is it?â€

â€œThe sun takes a bloody long time to go down out here.â€ She switched her disapproval to the orb in question. â€œItâ€™s much faster in the city.â€

Before he could argue with this ridiculous assertion, sheâ€™d glanced back at him, frowning.

â€œWhy arenâ€™t you wearing your gorget?â€ she demanded, hands on her hips. â€œI went to a deal of trouble to get it back for you!â€

â€œIâ€™m exceedingly grateful to you, maâ€™am,â€ he said, striving for gravity. â€œI thought it might provoke inquiries, though, should I turn up suddenly in the midst of camp wearing it, and I thought you and your sister might just possibly wish to avoid . . . tedious explanations?â€

She sniffed, but not without amusement.

â€œHow thoughtful. Not quite so thoughtful of your servants, though, are you?â€

â€œWhat do you mean?â€

â€œCome with me.â€ She linked her arm with his and towed him off toward the wood before he could protest. She led him to a small lean-to shelter in the undergrowth, which seemed to have been constructed of an unstuffed army bed sack and two petticoats. Bending down at her invitation, he discovered her sister, Fanny, within, sitting next to a bed sack that had been stuffed with fresh grass, upon which crouched both Colenso and Zeb, both looking bewildered. On sight of him, they crouched further.

â€œWhat the devil are you doing here?â€ he demanded. â€œAnd where is my dunnage, Zeb?â€

â€œBack there, sir,â€ Zeb quavered, jerking a thumb toward the growth behind the lean-to. â€œI couldnâ€™t find your tent and I didnâ€™t want to leave it, see.â€

â€œBut I told youâ€”and what about you, Baragwanath? Are you still ill?â€ William demanded, kneeling down suddenly and thrusting his head into the shelter. Colenso looked bad, pale as a cup of soured milk, and plainly in pain, curled up into himself.

â€œOh . . . â€™tisnâ€™t nothinâ€™, sir,â€ he said, swallowing heavily. â€œJust must have . . . ate . . . something.â€

â€œDid you see the surgeon?â€

Colenso turned his face into the bed sack, shoulders hunched. Zeb was edging away, apparently thinking of making a run for it.

William grabbed him by the arm; the little groom yelped and he let go. â€œWhatâ€™s wrong? Did you not have that arm seen to?â€

â€œTheyâ€™re afraid of the surgeons,â€ Jane said sharply.



William drew himself up to his full height and glared down at her.

â€œOh? Who told them they should be afraid of the surgeons? And how do they come to be in your care, may I ask?â€

Her lips pressed tight together, and she glanced involuntarily into the shelter. Fanny was looking out at them, doe eyes huge in the fading light. She swallowed and put a protective hand on Colensoâ€™s shoulder. Jane sighed deeply and took Williamâ€™s arm again.

â€œCome with me.â€

She led him away a short distance, still within sight of the little shelter but out of earshot.

â€œFanny and I were waiting for you when those boys came along together. The bigger oneâ€”what did you say his name is?â€

â€œColenso Baragwanath. Heâ€™s Cornish,â€ William added shortly, seeing a look of amusement flit across her face.

â€œReally. I hope it isnâ€™t catching. Well, he was so ill he couldnâ€™t stand, and sank down on the ground near us, making the most horrid noises. The little oneâ€”yes, I know heâ€™s Zebedee, thank youâ€”was beside himself, half-weeping with confusion. My sister is a most tenderhearted creature,â€ she said, rather apologetically. â€œShe went to help, and I followed.â€ She shrugged.

â€œWe got Colenso into the wood far enough to get his britches down in time, and I gave him a little water.â€ She touched a small wooden canteen that hung from her shoulder, and he wondered briefly where sheâ€™d got it. She hadnâ€™t had it when heâ€™d met the girls by the creek yesterday.

â€œI am much obliged to you, maâ€™am,â€ he said formally. â€œNowâ€”why is it, exactly, that you did not then take the boys in to see the surgeons?â€

For the first time, her composure showed signs of cracking. She turned a little away from him, and he noticed the last rays of the sun polishing the smooth crown of her head with a faint, familiar gleam of chestnut. The sight of it brought back memory of his first meeting with her with the force of a thunderclapâ€”and, with it, the memory of his mingled shame and arousal. Especially the latter.

â€œAnswer me,â€ he said, more roughly than heâ€™d intended, and she turned on him, eyes narrowed at his tone.

â€œThere was a finger lying on the ground by the surgeonâ€™s tent,â€ she snapped. â€œIt frightened my sister, and the boys took fright from her.â€

William rubbed a knuckle down the bridge of his nose, eyeing her.

â€œA finger.â€ He had himself seen piles of amputated limbs outside the surgeonsâ€™ tents at Saratoga, and aside from a quick prayer of gratitude that none of the disconnected arms and legs was his, had experienced no particular qualms. â€œWhose was it?â€

â€œHow should I know? I was too much occupied in keeping your orderly from shitting himself to ask.â€

â€œAh. Yes. Thank you,â€ he said, rather formally. He glanced toward the shelter again and was surprised to see that Fanny had come out and was hovering a little way from her sister, a wary look on her lovely face. Did he look threatening? he wondered. Just in case, he relaxed his posture a bit and smiled at Fanny. She didnâ€™t change expression, but continued to stare at him suspiciously.



He cleared his throat and took the sack off his shoulder, holding it out to Jane. â€œI thought you might have missed your supper. Have the boysâ€”well, Zeb, at leastâ€”eaten anything?â€

Jane nodded and took the bag with a celerity suggesting that it had been some time since the girls had had a meal. â€œHe ate with the other grooms, he said.â€

â€œAll right, then. Iâ€™ll take him in to have his arm seen to and perhaps get a dose for Colenso, while you and your sister refresh yourselves. Then, madam, we can discuss your own situation.â€

Heâ€™d been intensely aware of her physical presence for some moments, but when he said that, she turned the full effect of her eyes on himâ€”cider, he thought vaguely, or sherry wine?â€”and seemed somehow to flow, shifting in some indefinable way. He hadnâ€™t seen her move, but suddenly she was standing near enough to touch, and he smelled the odor of her hair and imagined he felt the warmth of her skin through her clothes. She took his hand briefly, and her thumb moved across the palm, slowly. The palm tingled and the hairs on his arm rippled.

â€œIâ€™m sure we can come to a reasonable accommodation, my lord,â€ she said, very grave, and let him go.

He dragged Zeb into the surgeonâ€™s tent like a recalcitrant colt and stood by, only half-attending, as a young Scottish surgeon with freckles swabbed the boyâ€™s wound clean of dirt. Arabellaâ€“Jane didnâ€™t smell of the whorish scent sheâ€™d worn at the brothel, but, by Christ, she smelled good.

â€œWe should cauterize the wound, sir,â€ the young doctorâ€™s voice was saying. â€œIt will stop an abscess forming, aye?â€

â€œNo!â€ Zeb jerked away from the doctor and made a dash for the door, knocking into people and sending one woman flying with a shriek. Jolted out of his random thoughts, William made a reflexive dive and knocked the boy flat.

â€œCome on, Zeb,â€ he said, hauling Zeb to his feet and propelling him firmly back to Dr. MacFreckles. â€œIt wonâ€™t be that bad. Just a moment or two, and then itâ€™s all over.â€

Zeb appearing patently unconvinced by this, William deposited him firmly on a stool and pulled up his own right cuff.

â€œLook,â€ he said, displaying the long, comet-shaped scar on his forearm. â€œThatâ€™s what happens when you get an abscess.â€

Both Zeb and the doctor peered at the scar, impressed. It had been a splinter wound, he told them, caused by a lightning-struck tree.

â€œWandered round the Great Dismal Swamp for three days in a fever,â€ he said. â€œSome . . . Indians found me and got me to a doctor. I nearly died, andâ€â€”he lowered his brows and gave Zeb a piercing lookâ€”â€œthe doctor was just about to cut off my arm, when the abscess burst and he cauterized it. You might not be so lucky, hey?â€

Zeb still looked unhappy, but reluctantly agreed. William gripped him by the shoulders and said encouraging things while the iron was heating, but his own heart was beating as fast as it might have had he been awaiting cautery himself.

Indians. One, in particular. Heâ€™d thought heâ€™d exhausted his anger, but there it bloody was again, bursting into bright fresh flame like an ember smashed open with a poker.

Bloody fucking Ian Murray. Fucking Scot and sometime Mohawk. His bloody fucking cousin, which made it all that much worse.

And then there was Rachel. . . . Murray had taken him to Dr. Hunter and Rachel. He drew a deep, ragged breath, remembering her worn indigo gown, hanging on its peg in the Huntersâ€™ house. Grabbing a handful of the cloth and pressing it to his face, breathing in her scent as though starved of air.

That was where Murray had met Rachel himself. And now she was betrothed to thatâ€”

â€œOw!â€ Zeb writhed, and William realized belatedly that he was digging his fingers into the boyâ€™s shoulder, just likeâ€”he let go as though Zeb were a hot potato, feeling the memory of James Fraserâ€™s iron grip on his arm and the agonizing pain that had numbed him from shoulder to fingertip.

â€œSorry,â€ he said, voice shaking a little with the effort to hide his fury. â€œSorry, Zeb.â€ The surgeon was ready with the glowing iron; William took Zebâ€™s arm, as gently as he could, and held it still while the thing was done. Rachel had held his own.

Heâ€™d been right; it was quick. The surgeon pressed the hot iron to the wound and counted five, slowly, then took it away. Zeb went stiff as a tent pole and sucked in enough breath to supply three people, but didnâ€™t scream.

â€œItâ€™s done,â€ the doctor said, taking the iron away and smiling at Zeb. â€œHere, Iâ€™ll put a bit of sweet oil on and bandage it. Ye did well, laddie.â€

Zebâ€™s eyes were watering, but he wasnâ€™t crying. He sniffed deeply and wiped the back of his hand across his face, looking up at William.

â€œWell done, Zeb,â€ William said, squeezing his shoulder gently, and Zeb managed a tiny smile in return.

By the time theyâ€™d returned to the girls and Colenso, William had managed to tamp down the rageâ€”again. Was he never going to be able to get rid of it? Not â€™til you make up your mind what to do about things, he thought grimly. But there wasnâ€™t anything that could be done right now, so he squashed all the sparks in his head firmly into one dense red ball and rolled it to the back of his mind.

â€œHere, let Fanny do it. He trusts her.â€ Jane took the vial containing the dose Dr. MacFreckles had made up for Colenso and gave it to her sister. Fanny promptly sat down beside Colenso, who was pretending as hard as he could to be asleep, and began stroking his head, murmuring something to him.

William nodded and, gesturing to Jane to accompany him, withdrew far enough to be out of earshot. Rather to his surprise, part of his brain had apparently been analyzing the problem and coming to conclusions while the rest was occupied, for he had a rough plan.

â€œWhat I suggest is this,â€ he said, without preamble. â€œI will make provision for you and your sister to receive regular army rations, as camp followers, and to travel under my protection. Once in New York, I will give you five pounds, and youâ€™re on your own. In return . . .â€

She didnâ€™t quite smile, but a dimple showed in one cheek.

â€œIn return,â€ he repeated more firmly, â€œyou will mind my orderly and my groom, tend their ills, and make sure theyâ€™re reasonably cared for. You will also be my laundress.â€

â€œYour laundress?!â€ The dimple had disappeared abruptly, replaced by an expression of sheer astonishment.

â€œLaundress,â€ he repeated doggedly. He knew what sheâ€™d been expecting him to propose and was rather surprised himself that he hadnâ€™t, but there it was. He couldnâ€™t, not with his thoughts of Rachel and of Anne Endicott so fresh in his mind. Not with the deep, smothered rage fueled by the thought that he deserved no woman but a whore.

â€œBut I donâ€™t know how to do laundry!â€

â€œHow hard can it be?â€ he asked, as patiently as he could. â€œYou wash my clothes. Donâ€™t put starch in my drawers. Thatâ€™s about it, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œButâ€”butâ€”â€ She looked aghast. â€œOne needs a . . . a kettle! A fork, a paddle, something to stir with . . . Soap! I havenâ€™t any soap!â€

â€œOh.â€ That hadnâ€™t occurred to him. â€œWell . . .â€ He dug in his pocket, found it empty, and tried the other, which held a guinea, tuppence, and a florin. He handed her the guinea. â€œBuy what you need, then.â€

She looked at the golden coin in her palm, her face utterly blank. She opened her mouth, then closed it again.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ he asked impatiently. She didnâ€™t answer, but a soft voice behind him did.

â€œThe duffent know how.â€

He whirled to find Fanny looking up at him from under her cap, her delicate cheeks flushed red by the sunset.

â€œWhat did you say?â€

Fannyâ€™s soft mouth pressed tight and her cheeks grew redder, but she repeated it, dogged. â€œThe . . . duffent . . . know how.â€

Jane reached Fanny in two steps, putting an arm around her sisterâ€™s shoulders and glaring at William.

â€œMy sisterâ€™s tongue-tied,â€ she said, daring him to say anything. â€œThatâ€™s why sheâ€™s afraid of the surgeons. She thinks they will amputate her tongue if they find out.â€

He drew a deep, slow breath.

â€œI see. And what she said to me . . . â€˜She doesnâ€™t know howâ€™? She means you, I collect? What is it, pray, that you donâ€™t know how?â€

â€œMuddy,â€ whispered Fanny, now staring at the ground.

â€œMudâ€”money?â€ He stared at Jane. â€œYou donâ€™t know how toâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™ve never had any money!â€ she snapped, and threw the guinea on the ground at his feet. â€œI know the names of the coins, but I donâ€™t know what you can buy with them, exceptâ€”exceptâ€”what you can buy in a brothel! My cunt is worth six shillings, all right? My mouth is three. And my arse is a pound. But if someone gave me three shillings, I wouldnâ€™t know if I could buy a loaf of bread or a horse with them! Iâ€™ve never bought anything!â€

â€œYouâ€”you meanâ€”â€ He was so flabbergasted, he couldnâ€™t string words into a sentence. â€œBut you have wages. You saidâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™ve been a brothel whore since I was ten years old!â€ Her fists clenched, knuckles sharp under the skin. â€œI never see my wages! Mrs. Abbott spends themâ€”she saysâ€”for myâ€”ourâ€”food and clothes. Iâ€™ve never had a penny to my name, let alone spent one. And now you hand me . . . thatâ€â€”she stamped her foot on the guinea, driving it into the groundâ€”â€œand tell me to buy a kettle?!? Where? How? From whom?!â€

Her voice shook and her face was a deal redder than the setting sun could make it. She was furious, but also very near to tears. He wanted to take her in his arms and soothe her, but thought that might be a good way to lose a finger.

â€œHow old is Fanny?â€ he asked instead. She jerked her head up, panting.

â€œFanny?â€ she said blankly.

â€œIâ€™m e-lev-en,â€ Fannyâ€™s voice said behind him. â€œYou weve her awone!â€

He turned to see the girl glaring up at him, a stick clutched in her hand. He might have laughed, if not for the expression on her faceâ€”and if not for what heâ€™d just realized. He took a step back, so as to see both girls at once, and like magnet and iron, they came together and clung, both staring distrustfully at him.

â€œHow much is her maidenhead worth?â€ he asked Jane baldly, with a nod at Fanny.

â€œTen pounth,â€ Fanny answered automatically, just as Jane shouted, â€œSheâ€™s not for sale! To you or any other bugger!â€ She pressed Fanny fiercely closer, daring him to make a move toward the girl.

â€œI donâ€™t want her,â€ he said through his teeth. â€œI donâ€™t fornicate with children, for Godâ€™s sake!â€

Janeâ€™s hard expression didnâ€™t alter, and she didnâ€™t loosen her grip on her sister.

â€œThen why did you ask?â€

â€œTo verify my suppositions regarding your presence here.â€

Jane snorted. â€œThose being?â€

â€œThat you ran away. Presumably because your sister has now reached an age where . . . ?â€ He raised an eyebrow, nodding at Fanny. Janeâ€™s lips compressed, but she gave him a tiny, grudging nod.

â€œCaptain Harkness?â€ he asked. It was a shot in the dark, but well aimed. Harkness hadnâ€™t been pleased at being deprived of his prey and, unable to come at William, might well have decided to take his revenge elsewhere.

The light bathed everything in tones of gold and lavender, but he could see Janeâ€™s face go pale, nonetheless, and felt a tightening in his loins. If he found Harkness . . . He resolved to go looking tomorrow. The man might be in Philadelphia, as sheâ€™d saidâ€”but he might not. It would be a welcome focus for his rage.

â€œRight, then,â€ he said, as matter-of-factly as he could. He stooped and pried the guinea out of the soft earth, realizing as he did so that heâ€™d been a fool to offer it to her. Not because of what sheâ€™d told him but because someone like herâ€”or Colensoâ€”would never have such a sum. Theyâ€™d be suspected of stealing it and very likely would be relieved of it by the first person to see it.

â€œJust look after the boys, will you?â€ he said to Jane. â€œAnd the both of you keep clear of the soldiers until I can find you simple clothes. Dressed like thatâ€â€”he gestured at their dust-smudged, sweat-stained fineryâ€”â€œyouâ€™ll be taken for whores, and soldiers donâ€™t take no for an answer.â€

â€œI am a whore,â€ Jane said, in a strange, dry voice.

â€œNo,â€ he said, and felt his own voice as oddly separate from himself but very firm. â€œYouâ€™re not. You travel under my protection. Iâ€™m not a pimpâ€”so youâ€™re not a whore. Not until we reach New York.â€





A DISCOVERY IN THE RANKS

THE 16TH PENNSYLVANIA militia company, Captain the Reverend Peleg Woodsworth in command, marched into camp in good order, having paused just outside to tidy themselves, clean their weapons, and wash their faces. Lord John knew no one would take notice but approved of the preparations on grounds of good military discipline, as he explained to Germain.

â€œSlovenly troops make bad fighters,â€ he said, critically examining a large rent in the sleeve of his filthy black coat. â€œAnd soldiers must be in the habit of obeying orders, no matter what those orders are.â€

Germain nodded. â€œAye, thatâ€™s what my mam says. Doesnâ€™t matter whether ye see the point or not, ye do as yeâ€™re told, or else.â€

â€œYour mother would make an admirable sergeant,â€ Grey assured his orderly. Heâ€™d encountered Marsali Fraser once or twice, at her printshop. â€œSplendid grasp of the essence of command. Speaking of â€˜or else,â€™ thoughâ€”what, exactly, do you expect to happen when you go home?â€

It was evident that Germain hadnâ€™t given much thought to the prospect, but after a moment he uncreased his brow.

â€œLikely itâ€™ll depend how long Iâ€™ve been gone,â€ he said, with a shrug. â€œIf I went back tomorrow, Iâ€™d get my ears blistered and my arse, too. But I think if I was to be gone longer than a week, sheâ€™d be pleased I wasna deid.â€

â€œAh. Have you heard the story of the Prodigal Son, by chance?â€

â€œNo, me loâ€”er . . . Bert.â€ Germain coughed. â€œHow does it go?â€

â€œItâ€™sâ€”â€ he began automatically, but then stopped dead, feeling as though a stake had been driven through his chest. The company had already begun to fray and straggle; the few men behind him merely skirted him and went past. Germain twisted round to see what he was looking at.

â€œItâ€™s that man who pretends to be a Frenchman. My father doesnâ€™t like him.â€

Grey stared at the gentleman in the suit of very fashionable blue and gray-striped silk, who was likewise staring at Grey, mouth slightly open, ignoring the small knot of Continental officers accompanying him.

â€œI know a lot of Frenchmen,â€ Grey said, recovering his breath. â€œBut youâ€™re right; thatâ€™s not one of them.â€ He turned his back on the man, mind awhirl, and gripped Germain by the arm.

â€œYour grandfather has to be in this moil somewhere,â€ he said, forcing resolution into his voice. â€œDo you see the building over there, with the flag?â€ He nodded at the limp banner, on the far side of the sprawling camp, but clearly visible. â€œGo there. That will be the commander in chiefâ€™s headquarters. Tell one of the officers who youâ€™re looking for; theyâ€™ll find him for you among the militia.â€

â€œOh, they wonâ€™t have to,â€ Germain assured him. â€œGrand-pÃ¨re will be there.â€

â€œWhere?â€

â€œWith General Washington,â€ Germain said, with the exaggerated patience of those forced to consort with dunces. â€œHeâ€™s a general, too; did ye not know that?â€ Before Grey could respond to this piece of flabbergasting intelligence, Germain had scampered away in the direction of the distant banner.

Grey risked a glance over his shoulder, but Perseverance Wainwright had disappeared, as had the Continental officers, leaving only a couple of lieutenants in conversation.

He thought several blasphemous things in a row, alternating between Jamie Fraser and Percy Wainwright as the recipients of assorted violent assaults of a personal nature. What the fucking hell was either of them doing here? His fingers twitched, wanting to strangle someone, but he fought back this useless impulse in favor of deciding what the devil to do now.

He began to walk hastily, with no clear notion where he was going. Percy had seen him, he knew that much. Jamie hadnâ€™t, but might at any moment. A general? What theâ€”no time to worry about that just now. What might either one of them do about it?

He hadnâ€™t seen Percyâ€”ex-lover, ex-brother, French spy, and all-around shitâ€”since their last conversation in Philadelphia, some months before. When Percy had first reappeared in Greyâ€™s life, it had been with a last attempt at seductionâ€”political rather than physical, though Grey had an idea that he wouldnâ€™t have balked at the physical, either. . . . It was an offer for the British government: the return to France of the valuable Northwest Territory, in return for the promise of Percyâ€™s â€œinterestsâ€ to keep the French government from making an alliance with the American colonies.

He hadâ€”as a matter of dutyâ€”conveyed the offer discreetly to Lord North and then expunged itâ€”and Percyâ€”from his mind. He had no idea what, if anything, the First Minister had made of it.

Too late now in any case, he thought. France had signed a treaty with the rebellious colonies in April. It remained to be seen, though, whether that treaty would result in anything tangible in the way of support. The French were notoriously unreliable.

So now what? His instinct toward self-preservation urged him to fade quietly through the camp and disappear as quickly as possible. Germain wouldnâ€™t tell Jamie he was here; theyâ€™d agreed that much in advance. Two considerations held him back, though: first, the minor matter that he didnâ€™t yet know where the British army was or how far away. And second . . . a sense of curiosity about Percy that he himself recognized as dangerously reckless.

Heâ€™d kept moving, since to stand still was to be knocked over and trampled, and now found himself walking beside the Reverend Woodsworth. The tall ministerâ€™s face was suffused with an excitement that kept breaking through the manâ€™s normal mien of calm dignity, and Grey couldnâ€™t help smiling at it.

â€œGod has brought us safe thus far, Bert,â€ Woodsworth said, looking about him with shining eyes. â€œAnd He will grant us victory, I know it!â€

â€œAh.â€ Grey groped for some reply, and findingâ€”to his surpriseâ€”that he was incapable of agreeing with this statement, settled for, â€œI suppose we cannot presume to divine the Almightyâ€™s intent, but I do trust He will preserve us, in His mercy.â€

â€œVery well said, Bert, very well said.â€ And Woodsworth clapped him resoundingly on the back.





QUAKERS AND QUARTERMASTERS

JAMIE FOUND NATHANAEL Greene in his tent and still in shirtsleeves, the remains of breakfast on a table before him, frowning at a letter in his hand. He put this down at once upon seeing Jamie and rose to his feet.

â€œCome in, sir, do! Have you et anything yet today? Iâ€™ve a spare egg going to waste.â€ He smiled, but briefly; whatever had troubled him about the letter still lurked in the creases of his brow. Jamie glanced at it from the corner of his eye; from the blots and ragged edge, it looked a piece of domestic correspondence, rather than an official note.

â€œI have, I thank ye, sir,â€ Jamie said, with a slight bow of acknowledgment toward the egg, which sat neglected in a little wooden cup with a flowered heart painted on it. â€œI only wondered, if ye meant to ride out today, might I come with ye?â€

â€œOf course!â€ Greene looked surprised but pleased. â€œI should welcome your advice, General.â€

â€œPerhaps we might trade wisdom, then,â€ Jamie suggested. â€œFor I should value your own advice, though perhaps on a different matter.â€

Greene paused, coat half-pulled on.



â€œReally? Advice on what sort of matter?â€

â€œMarriage.â€

Greeneâ€™s face struggled between astonishment, a courteous attempt to suppress the astonishment, and something else. He glanced behind him at the letter lying on the table and settled his coat on his shoulders.

â€œI could use sound advice on that matter myself, General Fraser,â€ he said, with a wry twist of the lips. â€œLetâ€™s be off, then.â€

They rode out of camp north by northwestâ€”Greene was equipped with a battered compass, and Jamie wished for a moment that he still possessed the gold-plated astrolabe that William had sent from London at the behest of Lord John. That had perished when the Big House burned, though the spurt of dark feeling that went through him now had more to do with the thought of John Grey than with the fire and its aftermath.

Conversation at first dealt only with the business at hand: the location of supply dumps along the probable line of marchâ€”and, if necessary, retreat, though no one spoke of that possibility. There was no particular doubt as to where the British army was headed; a body that large, with an enormous baggage train and outlying flocks of camp followers, was limited in its choice of roads.

â€œAye, that would do,â€ Jamie said, nodding in agreement at Greeneâ€™s suggestion of an abandoned farmstead. â€œDâ€™ye think the wellâ€™s good?â€

â€œIâ€™m minded to find out,â€ Greene said, turning his horseâ€™s head toward the farm. â€œItâ€™s hot as Hades already. Scorch our ears off by noon, I reckon.â€

It was hot; theyâ€™d left off their stocks and waistcoats and were riding in shirtsleeves, coats across their saddlebows, but Jamie felt the linen of his shirt sticking to his back and sweat trickling over his ribs and down his face. Fortunately, the well was still good; water glimmered visibly below, and a stone dropped in gave back a satisfactory plunk!

â€œI confess Iâ€™m surprised to find you in want of advice regarding marriage, General,â€ Greene said, having first drunk his fill and then upended a bucketful of water luxuriously over his head. He blinked water off his lashes, shook himself like a dog, and handed the bucket to Jamie, who nodded thanks. â€œI should have thought your own union most harmonious.â€

â€œAye, well, itâ€™s not my own marriage Iâ€™m worrit for,â€ Jamie said, grunting a little as he pulled up a fresh full bucketâ€”hand over hand, for the windlass had rotted away and heâ€™d been obliged to fetch a rope from his saddlebag. â€œWill ye ken a young scout named Ian Murray? Heâ€™s my nephew.â€

â€œMurray. Murray . . .â€ Greene looked blank for a moment, but then comprehension dawned. â€œOh, him! Yes, drat him. Your nephew, you say? Thought he was an Indian. Cost me a guinea on that race. My wife wonâ€™t be happy about that at all. Not that sheâ€™s happy at the moment, regardless,â€ he added with a sigh. Evidently the letter had been domestic.

â€œWell, I might persuade him to give it ye back,â€ Jamie said, suppressing a smile, â€œif ye might be able to help him to wed.â€

He raised the bucket overhead and gave himself over to a moment of joy as the drench of water quenched the heat. He drew one deep, grateful breath of coolness, tasting of the dank stones at the bottom of the well, and likewise shook himself.



â€œHe means to marry a Quaker lass,â€ he said, opening his eyes. â€œI kent that ye were a Friend yourself, havinâ€™ heard ye speak to Mrs. Hardman when we met. So I wondered, maybe, if ye could tell me just whatâ€™s needed in the way of requirement for such a marriage?â€

If Greene had been surprised to find that Ian was Jamieâ€™s nephew, this news seemed to knock him speechless. He stood for a moment, pushing his lips in and out, as though they might suck up a word he could spit back out, and at last found one.

â€œWell,â€ he said. He paused for a bit, considering, and Jamie waited patiently. Greene was a man of fairly strong opinions, but he didnâ€™t give them hastily. Jamie did wonder what there was to consider in his question, thoughâ€”were Quakers even stranger in their customs than he thought?

â€œWell,â€ Greene said again, and exhaled, settling his shoulders. â€œI must tell you, General, that I no longer consider myself a Friend, though I was indeed raised in that sect.â€ He shot Jamie a sharp look. â€œAnd I must also tell you that the cause of my departure was a mislike of their narrow-minded, superstitious ways. If your nephew means to turn Quaker, sir, Iâ€™d recommend you do your best to dissuade him.â€

â€œOch. Well, thatâ€™s part of the difficulty, I gather,â€ Jamie replied equably. â€œHe doesna mean to turn Quaker himself. And I think that a wise decision; he isna suited for it at all.â€

Greene relaxed a little at that and went so far as to smile, if wryly.

â€œIâ€™m glad to hear it. But he has no objection to his wife remaining a Friend?â€

â€œI think heâ€™s better sense than to suggest otherwise.â€

That made Greene laugh. â€œPerhaps heâ€™ll manage marriage well enough, then.â€

â€œOh, heâ€™ll make a bonny husband for the lass, Iâ€™ve nay doubt. Itâ€™s the getting them wed that seems a difficulty.â€

â€œAh. Yes.â€ Greene glanced round the homestead, wiping his wet face with a wadded handkerchief. â€œThat might in fact be very difficult, if the young woman . . . well. Let me think for a moment. In the meantime . . . the wellâ€™s good, but we canâ€™t store powder here; thereâ€™s not much roof left, and Iâ€™m told this weather often presages thunderstorms.â€

â€œThereâ€™s likely a root cellar at the back,â€ Jamie suggested.

There was. The door had gone and a tangle of spindly, pallid vines had sprouted from a rotted sack of potatoes abandoned in the corner, tendrils crawling in slow desperation toward the light.

â€œItâ€™ll do,â€ Greene decided, and made a penciled note in the small book he carried everywhere. â€œLetâ€™s move on, then.â€

They let the horses drink, poured more water over themselves, and rode on, gently steaming. Greene was not a chatterer, and there had been no conversation for a mile or two, when he finally reached a conclusion of his mental processes.

â€œThe principal thing to bear in mind regarding Friends,â€ he said, without preliminary, â€œis that they depend very much upon one anotherâ€™s company and opinionâ€”often to the exclusion of the world outside their meetings.â€ He shot Jamie a glance. â€œThe young womanâ€”is your nephew known to her meeting?â€



â€œMmphm,â€ Jamie said. â€œAs I understand from her brother, they were both put out of their meetingâ€”in a small place in Virginia when he decided to become a surgeon in the Continental army. Or perhaps he was put out, and she merely went with him; I dinna ken whether it makes a difference.â€

â€œOh, I see.â€ Greene plucked the wet shirt away from his body in hopes of admitting a little air to his skin, but it was a vain hope. The air lay thick as a woolen blanket on the simmering countryside. â€œA â€˜fighting Quaker,â€™ as they call it?â€

â€œNo, he willna take up arms,â€ Jamie assured Greene, â€œbut apparently his merely being connected with the army offended his meeting.â€ Greene snorted in what appeared to be a personal way, and Jamie cleared his throat. â€œIn fact, Denzell Hunterâ€”Dr. Hunterâ€”also is engaged to be married. Though his path may be somewhat smoother, in that his bride has become a Friend herself.â€

â€œHas she a home meeting?â€ Greene asked sharply. Jamie shook his head.

â€œNo, it appeared to be a . . . private event. The conversion, I mean. I am told that Quakers dinna have either clergy or ritual . . . ?â€ He left that hanging delicately, and Greene snorted again.

â€œNor do they. But I assure you, General, there is nothing truly private in a Friendâ€™s lifeâ€”certainly no spiritual matter. My own father opposed reading, as being a practice likely to separate one from God, and when as a young man I not only read but began to collect works on military strategy, in which I had an interest, I was brought before an examination committee from our meeting and subjected to such questions as toâ€”well, as I say, I am no longer a member of that sect.â€

He blew out his lips and made small rumbling noises for a bit, frowning at the road aheadâ€”though Jamie saw that, even in his preoccupation, Greene was taking note of their surroundings, with an eye to logistics.

He himself had become aware of a certain vibration in the air and wondered if Greene sensed it. Not quite noise, it was a disturbance that he knew well: a large body of men and horses, too far away to see their dustâ€”but there. Theyâ€™d found the British army. He slowed a little, looking carefully at the trees ahead in case of British scoutsâ€”for the British must surely know by now that they were pursued.

Greeneâ€™s hearing was less acute, though, or perhaps he was only preoccupied, for he glanced at Jamie in surprise, though he slowed, as well. Jamie raised a hand to stop him speaking and lifted his chinâ€”there was a rider coming toward them, following the road. The sound of hooves was audible, and Jamieâ€™s own mount flung up his head and whickered with interest, nostrils flaring.

Both men had come armed; Greene set a hand on the musket balanced across his saddle. Jamie left his rifle in its sling but checked the priming of the pistols in his saddle holsters. Awkward to fire a long gun from horseback.

The rider was coming slowly, though; Jamieâ€™s hand on the pistolâ€™s grip relaxed, and he shook his head at Greene. They reined up, waiting, and a moment later the rider came in view.

â€œIan!â€

â€œUncle Jamie!â€ Ianâ€™s face blossomed with relief at sight of him, and no wonder. He was dressed like a Mohawk, in buckskin leggings and calico shirt, with feathers in his hair, and a long, hairy gray carcass lay across his saddlebow, blood dripping slowly from it down the horseâ€™s leg.

The beast wasnâ€™t dead, though; Rollo twitched and raised his head, giving the newcomers a yellow wolf glare, but recognized Jamieâ€™s scent and barked once, then let his tongue loll out, panting.

â€œWhatâ€™s happened to the hound, then?â€ Jamie rode up alongside and leaned forward to look.

â€œThe numpty fell into a deadfall trap,â€ Ian said, frowning rebuke at the dog. Then he gently scratched the big dogâ€™s ruff. â€œMind, Iâ€™d haâ€™ fallen in it myself, if he hadna gone before me.â€

â€œBad hurt?â€ Jamie asked. He didnâ€™t think so; Rollo was giving General Greene his usual look of appraisalâ€”a look that made most people take a few steps back. Ian shook his head, his hand curled into Rolloâ€™s fur to keep him steady.

â€œNay, but heâ€™s torn his leg and heâ€™s lame. I was looking for a safe place to leave him; Iâ€™ve got to report in to Captain Mercer. Though seeinâ€™ as youâ€™re hereâ€”oh, good day to ye, sir,â€ he said to Greene, whose horse had backed up in response to Rollo and was presently indicating a strong desire to keep going, in spite of his riderâ€™s inclination. Ian sketched a salute and turned back to Jamie. â€œSeeinâ€™ as youâ€™re here, Uncle Jamie, could ye maybe fetch Rollo back to the lines with ye and get Auntie Claire to tend his leg?â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ Jamie said, resigned, and swung down from the saddle, groping for his soggy handkerchief. â€œLet me bind his leg first. I dinna want blood all over my breeks, and the horse willna like it, either.â€

Greene cleared his throat.

â€œAs you mention reporting, Mr. . . . Murray?â€ he asked, with a sideways glance at Jamie, who nodded. â€œPerhaps youâ€™d be so good as to give me, as well as Captain Mercer, the benefit of your report?â€

â€œAye, sir,â€ Ian said agreeably. â€œThe armyâ€™s divided into three bodies now, wiâ€™ a great long line oâ€™ baggage wagons in between. Sae far as I could tellâ€”I exchanged words wiâ€™ another scout whoâ€™d gone all the way up the columnâ€”theyâ€™re headed toward a place called Freehold. The groundâ€™s no verra good for attackâ€”folded up like a used napkin, all cut up wiâ€™ ravines and bitty creeksâ€”though the other scout told me thereâ€™s meadows beyond that might do for a fight, and ye could lure them or drive them out there.â€

Greene asked sharp questions, some of which Ian could answer and some he couldnâ€™t, while Jamie tended to the ginger business of binding up the dogâ€™s legâ€”there was a nasty stake wound, though not too deep; he hoped the stake hadnâ€™t been poisoned. Indians would do that sometimes, in case a wounded deer or wolverine might spring out of the trap.

Jamieâ€™s horse was not enthused at the prospect of carrying a wolf on his back but eventually was persuaded, and with no more than a nervous eye roll backward now and then, they were mounted.

â€œFuirich, a choin,â€ Ian said, leaning over and scratching Rollo behind the ears. â€œIâ€™ll be back, aye? Taing, Uncle!â€ And with a brief nod to Greene, he was away, his own horse clearly wanting to put as much distance between himself and Rollo as possible.

â€œDear Lord,â€ Greene said, wrinkling his nose at the dogâ€™s reek.

â€œAye, well,â€ Jamie said, resigned. â€œMy wife says ye get used to any sort of smell after a bit of smelling it. And I suppose sheâ€™d know.â€

â€œWhy, is she a cook?â€

â€œOch, no. A physician. Gangrene, ken, festering bowels and the like.â€

Greene blinked.

â€œI see. You have a most interesting family, Mr. Fraser.â€ He coughed and looked after Ian, rapidly vanishing in the distance. â€œYou might be wrong about him never becoming a Quaker. At least he doesnâ€™t bow his head to a title.â€





A VISCOUS THREE-WAY

JAMIE CAME BACK from his ride with General Greene looking damp, wrinkled, and completely disheveled but otherwise refreshedâ€”and with Rollo, bloody and disgruntled but not badly hurt.

â€œHeâ€™ll be fine,â€ I said, scratching Rollo gently behind the ears. The gash had bled a lot, but wasnâ€™t deep. â€œI donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll stitch it.â€

â€œDinna blame ye a bit, Sassenach,â€ Jamie said, glancing at the dog, who had suffered my cleaning, salving, and bandaging his leg but didnâ€™t look at all inclined to stand for more fiddling. â€œWhere are my good stockings?â€

â€œIn the portmanteau with your other linen,â€ I replied patiently. â€œWhere they are every morning. Surely you know that?â€

â€œI do,â€ he admitted. â€œI just like ye to tend to me.â€

â€œAll right,â€ I said, obligingly pulling them out. â€œDâ€™you want me to put them on for you?â€

â€œNay, I can manage that,â€ he said, taking them. â€œCould ye find my shirt, though?â€

â€œI think I can do that, yes,â€ I replied, taking the shirt out of the same portmanteau and shaking it out. â€œHow was General Greene this morning?â€

â€œGood. I asked him about the Quaker way of marriage,â€ he said, pulling a fresh white shirtâ€”his only fresh white shirt, as I pointed outâ€”over his head.

â€œEvidently the difficulty is with Denzell and Rachel not havinâ€™ a home meeting, as itâ€™s called. Itâ€™s no that they canna marry, but to do it in the proper way, it would involve the whole meeting. Thereâ€™s a thing called a Clearness Committee, which meets wiâ€™ the bride and groom to counsel them and make sure theyâ€™re suited and that theyâ€™ve some notion what theyâ€™re in for.â€ He shrugged into the sleeves and grinned at me. â€œI couldna help thinking, while he was tellinâ€™ me, what a committee like that would have had to say about us when we wed.â€

â€œWell, they wouldnâ€™t have had any more notion what we were in for than we did,â€ I said, amused. â€œDo you think they would have thought us well suited?â€

â€œIf theyâ€™d seen the way I looked at ye, Sassenach, when ye didna see me lookinâ€™â€”then, aye, they would.â€ He kissed me briefly and looked round for the hairbrush. â€œCan ye club up my hair for me? I canna be reviewing my troops like this.â€ His hair was tied back carelessly with a leather thong, damp stray wisps sticking to his face.

â€œOf course. How many of them are you reviewing? And when?â€ I sat him down on the stool and set to work with the brush. â€œHave you been burrowing through the countryside headfirst? You have foxtails and leaves in your hair, and those winged seeds that elder trees make. Ooh! To say nothing of this.â€ I carefully removed a tiny green caterpillar that had become entangled in his tresses and showed it to him, perched inquisitively on my forefinger.

â€œThalla le Dia,â€ he said to the caterpillar. Go with God. And taking it carefully onto his own finger, brought it to the tent flap and loosed it into the grass.

â€œAll of them, Sassenach,â€ he said, returning and sitting down again. â€œMy last two companies came in this morning; theyâ€™ll have been fed now and rested a bit. I meant to ask,â€ he added, twisting round to look up at me, â€œwould ye come with me, Sassenach, and have a look at them? To see if any should be left back from the fighting or to tend any that might need the odd bit oâ€™ repair.â€

â€œYes, of course. When?â€

â€œCome to the parade ground in an hour, if ye would.â€ He passed a hand over the neatly gleaming auburn queue, doubled on itself and ribboned in a club at his nape. â€œAye, thatâ€™s grand. Am I decent otherwise?â€

He stood up and brushed bits of discarded leaf from his sleeve. The crown of his head brushed the tent, and he was glowingâ€”with sun, energy, and the suppressed excitement of impending action.

â€œYou look like bloody Mars, god of war,â€ I said dryly, handing him his waistcoat. â€œTry not to scare your men.â€

His mouth quirked as he shrugged into the waistcoat, but he spoke seriously, eyes on mine.

â€œOch, I want them frightened of me, Sassenach. Itâ€™s the only way Iâ€™ll have a chance of bringing them out of it alive.â€



WITH AN HOUR to spare, I took my kit of everyday medical supplies and went out to the big tree where the sick among the camp followers tended to gather. The army surgeons would tend camp followers as well as soldiers, if they had timeâ€”but they wouldnâ€™t be having time today.

There was the usual assortment of minor ailments and injuries: a deeply embedded splinter (infected, requiring the application of drawing salve, followed by excavation, disinfection, and bandage); a dislocated toe (caused by the patient having kicked a fellow in play, but the work of a moment to reduce); a split lip (requiring one stitch and a little gentian ointment); a badly gashed foot (the result of inattention whilst chopping wood, requiring twenty-eight stitches and a large dressing); one child with an ear infection (an onion poultice and willow-bark tea prescribed); another with the bellyache (peppermint tea and a strong admonition against eating eggs of unknown age out of birdsâ€™ nests of unknown provenance) . . .

The few patients requiring medicines I put aside until Iâ€™d dealt with the injuries. Thenâ€”with a wary eye on the sunâ€”I led them off to my tent to dispense packets of willow bark, peppermint, and hemp leaves.

The tent flap was open; surely I had left it closed? I ducked my head into the gloom of the tent and stopped abruptly. A tall figure stood before me, apparently in the act of rifling my medicine chest.

â€œWhat the devil are you doing with that?â€ I asked sharply, and the figure jerked, startled.

My eyes had now become accustomed to the diffuse light, and I saw that the thiefâ€”if thatâ€™s what he wasâ€”was a Continental officer, a captain.

â€œI beg your pardon, madam,â€ he said, giving me a perfunctory bow. â€œI had heard that there was a supply of medicaments here. Iâ€”â€

â€œThere is, and theyâ€™re mine.â€ This seemed a trifle ungraciousâ€”though I certainly thought his own attitude rather brusqueâ€”and I softened the remark a little. â€œWhat is it that you need? I imagine I can spare a littleâ€”â€

â€œYours?â€ He glanced from the chestâ€”very clearly an expensive professional bit of furnitureâ€”to me, and his brows rose. â€œWhat are you doing with a thing like that?â€

Several possible replies flitted through my head, but Iâ€™d recovered from the surprise of seeing him sufficiently as not to make any of them. I settled for a neutral â€œMay I ask who you are, sir?â€

â€œOh.â€ Mildly flustered, he bowed to me. â€œI beg pardon. Captain Jared Leckie, your servant, maâ€™am. I am a surgeon with the Second New Jersey.â€

He eyed me consideringly, clearly wondering who the devil I was. I was wearing a canvas apron with capacious pockets over my gown, these pockets presently stuffed with all manner of small instruments, dressings, bottles and jars of ointments and liquids. Iâ€™d also taken off my broad-brimmed hat when I came into the tent and, as usual, was not wearing a cap. I had bound up my hair, but it had come loose and was coiling damply round my ears. He obviously suspected me of being a laundress, come to collect soiled linenâ€”or possibly something worse.

â€œI am Mrs. Fraser,â€ I said, drawing myself up with what I hoped was a gracious nod. â€œEr . . . Mrs. General Fraser, that is,â€ I added, seeing that he appeared unimpressed.

His eyebrows shot up, and he looked me openly up and down, his eyes lingering on the top pockets of my apron, these featuring an unwieldy rolled dressing in the act of coming unrolled and trailing down my front and a jar of asafoetida, whose cork was loose, thus allowing the reek of it to waft gently above the other notable smells of the camp. It was known commonly as â€œdevilâ€™s dung,â€ and for good reason. I pulled the jar out and pushed the cork in more securely. This gesture seemed somehow to reassure him.

â€œOh! The general is a physician, I perceive,â€ he said.

â€œNo,â€ I said, beginning to see that I should have uphill work with Captain Leckie, who appeared young and not overbright. â€œMy husband is a soldier. I am a physician.â€

He stared at me as though Iâ€™d told him I was a prostitute. Then he made the mistake of assuming that I was joking and laughed heartily.

At this point, one of my patients, a young mother whose one-year-old son had an ear infection, poked her neatly capped head hesitantly into the tent. Her little boy was in her arms, howling and red-faced.

â€œOh, dear,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™m so sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. Wilkins. Do bring him in; Iâ€™ll get the bark for him directly.â€

Captain Leckie frowned at Mrs. Wilkins and beckoned her closer. She looked nervously at me, but allowed him to lean down and look at little Peter.

â€œHe has a difficult tooth,â€ Leckie said, rather accusingly, after running a large, unwashed thumb through Peterâ€™s drooling mouth. â€œHe ought to have the gum slit, to let the tooth come through.â€ He began to fumble in his pocket, where he doubtless had a highly insanitary scalpel or lancet.

â€œHe is teething,â€ I agreed, shaking out a quantity of crumbled willow bark into my mortar. â€œBut he also has an ear infection, and the tooth will come through of its own accord within the next twenty-four hours.â€

He rounded on me, indignant and astonished.

â€œAre you contradicting me?â€

â€œWell, yes,â€ I said, rather mildly. â€œYouâ€™re wrong. You want to have a good look in his left ear. Itâ€™sâ€”â€

â€œI, madam, am a diplomate of the Medical College of Philadelphia!â€

â€œI congratulate you,â€ I said, beginning to be provoked. â€œYouâ€™re still wrong.â€ Having thus rendered him momentarily speechless, I finished grinding the bark into powder and poured it into a square of gauze, which I folded into a neat packet and handed to Mrs. Wilkins, with instructions as to the brewing of the infusion and how to administer it, as well as how to apply an onion poultice.

She took the packet as though it might explode and, with a hasty glance at Captain Leckie, fled, little Peterâ€™s howls receding like a siren in the distance.

I drew a deep breath.

â€œNow,â€ I said, as pleasantly as possible. â€œIf youâ€™re in need of simples, Dr. Leckie, I have a good supply. I canâ€”â€

He had drawn himself up like a crane eyeing a frog, beady-eyed and hostile.

â€œYour servant, maâ€™am,â€ he said curtly, and stalked past me.

I rolled my eyes up toward the canvas overhead. There was a small gecko-like creature clinging to the cloth, who viewed me with no particular emotion.

â€œHow to win friends and influence people,â€ I remarked to it. â€œTake note.â€ Then I pushed the tent flap back and beckoned for the next patient to come in.





I HAD TO hurry in order to make my rendezvous with Jamie, who was just about to begin his review when I dashed up, twisting my hair into a mass and pinning it hastily under my broad-brimmed hat. It was a terribly hot day; being in the open sun for only a few minutes had made my nose and cheeks tingle warningly.

Jamie bowed gravely to me and began his advance along the line of men drawn up for review, greeting men, saluting officers, asking questions, giving his aide-de-camp notes of things to be done.

He had Lieutenant Schnell with him as aide-de-campâ€”a nice German boy from Philadelphia, perhaps nineteenâ€”and a stout gentleman I didnâ€™t know but assumed from his uniform to be the captain in charge of whatever companies we were inspecting. I followed them, smiling at the men as I passed, while looking them over sharpish for any overt signs of illness, injury, or disabilityâ€”I was sure that Jamie could spot excessive drunkenness without my expert opinion.

There were three hundred men, heâ€™d told me, and most of them were quite all right. I kept walking and nodding, but wasnâ€™t above beginning to fantasize some dangerous circumstance in which I found Captain Leckie writhing in pain, which I would graciously allay, causing him to grovel and apologize for his objectionable attitude. I was trying to choose between the prospect of a musket ball embedded in his buttock, testicular torsion, and something temporarily but mortifyingly disfiguring, like Bellâ€™s palsy, when my eye caught a glimpse of something odd in the lineup.

The man in front of me was standing bolt upright, musket at port arms, eyes fixed straight ahead. This was perfectly correctâ€”but no other man in the line was doing it. Militiamen were more than capable, but they generally saw no point in military punctilio. I glanced at the rigid soldier, passed byâ€”then glanced back.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ!â€ I exclaimed, and only sheer chance kept Jamie from hearing me, he being distracted by the sudden arrival of a messenger.

I took two hasty steps back, bent, and peered under the brim of the dusty slouch hat. The face beneath was set in fierce lines, with a darkly ominous glowerâ€”and was completely familiar to me.

â€œBloody effing hell,â€ I whispered, seizing him by the sleeve. â€œWhat are you doing here?â€

â€œYou wouldnâ€™t believe me if I told you,â€ he whispered back, not moving a muscle of face or body. â€œDo walk on, my dear.â€

Such was my astonishment, I might actually have done it, had my attention not been drawn by a small figure skulking about behind the line, trying to avoid notice by crouching behind a wagon wheel.

â€œGermain!â€ I said, and Jamie whirled about, eyes wide.

Germain stiffened for an instant and then turned to flee, but too late; Lieutenant Schnell, living up to his name, sprang through the line and grabbed Germain by the arm.

â€œIs he yours, sir?â€ he asked, glancing curiously from Jamie to Germain and back.



â€œHe is,â€ Jamie said, with a tone that had turned many a manâ€™s blood to water. â€œWhat the devilâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™m an orderly!â€ Germain said proudly, trying to detach himself from Lieutenant Schnellâ€™s grip. â€œIâ€™m supposed to be here!â€

â€œNo, youâ€™re not,â€ his grandfather assured him. â€œAnd what do ye mean, an orderly? Whose orderly?â€

Germain at once glanced in Johnâ€™s direction, then, realizing his mistake, jerked his eyes back, but it was too late. Jamie reached John in a single stride and ripped the hat off his head.

The face was identifiable as that of Lord John Grey, but only by someone who knew him well. He wore a black felt patch over one eye, and the other was all but obscured by dirt and bruises. Heâ€™d cut his luxuriant blond hair to roughly an inch in length and appeared to have rubbed dirt into it.

With considerable aplomb, he scratched his head and handed Jamie his musket.

â€œI surrender to you, sir,â€ he said, in a clear voice. â€œTo you, personally. So does my orderly,â€ he added, putting a hand on Germainâ€™s shoulder. Lieutenant Schnell, quite flabbergasted, let go of Germain as though he were red-hot.

â€œI surrender, sir,â€ Germain said solemnly, and saluted.

Iâ€™d never seen Jamie at a complete loss for words, and didnâ€™t now, but it was a near thing. He inhaled strongly through his nose, then turned to Lieutenant Schnell.

â€œEscort the prisoners to Captain McCorkle, Lieutenant.â€

â€œEr . . .â€ I said apologetically. A hard blue eye swiveled in my direction, brow raised.

â€œHeâ€™s injured,â€ I said, as mildly as I could, with a brief gesture in Johnâ€™s direction. Jamieâ€™s lips compressed for an instant, but he nodded.

â€œTake the prisonersâ€”and Mrs. Fraserâ€â€”I daresay it was merely sensitivity on my part that perceived a certain emphasis on â€œMrs. Fraserâ€â€”â€œto my tent, Lieutenant.â€

With scarcely a breath, he turned on John.

â€œI accept your surrender, Colonel,â€ he said, with icy politeness. â€œAnd your parole. I will attend you later.â€

And, with that, he turned his back on the three of us, in what could only be described as a marked manner.



â€œWHAT ON EARTH happened to your eye?â€ I demanded, peering at it. I had John on the cot in my small medical tent, the flap open to admit as much light as possible. The eye was swollen half shut and surrounded by a sticky black ring where the felt patch had been peeled away, the underlying flesh a lurid palette of green, purple, and ghastly yellow. The eye itself was red as a flannel petticoat and, from the irritated state of the eyelids, had been watering more or less constantly for some time.

â€œYour husband punched me when I told him Iâ€™d bedded you,â€ he replied, with complete composure. â€œI do hope he didnâ€™t take any similarly violent actions upon being reunited with you?â€



Had I been capable of a convincing Scottish noise, I might have resorted to one. As it was, I merely glared at him.

â€œI decline absolutely to discuss my husband with you,â€ I said. â€œLie down, blast you.â€

He eased himself back on the cot, wincing.

â€œHe said he hit you twice,â€ I remarked, watching this. â€œWhere was the second one?â€

â€œIn the liver.â€ He gingerly touched his lower abdomen. I pulled up his shirt and inspected the damage, which amounted to further spectacular bruising around the lower ribs, with blue streaks draining down toward the ilial crest, but little more.

â€œThatâ€™s not where your liver is,â€ I informed him. â€œItâ€™s on the other side.â€

â€œOh.â€ He looked blank. â€œReally? Are you sure?â€

â€œYes, I am,â€ I assured him. â€œIâ€™m a doctor. Let me look at your eye.â€

I didnâ€™t wait for permission, but he didnâ€™t resist, lying back and staring up at the canvas roof while I spread the eyelids as far as possible. The sclera and conjunctiva were badly inflamed, and even the dim light made the eye water profusely. I held up two fingers.

â€œTwo,â€ he said, before I could ask. â€œAnd before you start ordering me to look to and fro and up and down . . . I canâ€™t. I can see out of itâ€”though itâ€™s a bit blurry, and I see everything doubled, which is very disagreeableâ€”but I canâ€™t move it at all. Dr. Hunter opined that some muscle or other was trapped by some sort of bone. He didnâ€™t feel competent to deal with it.â€

â€œIâ€™m flattered that you think I might be.â€

â€œI have the fullest confidence in your abilities, Dr. Fraser,â€ he said politely. â€œBesides, have I any choice?â€

â€œNo. Keep quite still, there . . . Germain!â€ I had caught sight of a telltale flutter of pink calico from the corner of my eye, and the runaway came sidling in, looking vaguely guilty.

â€œDonâ€™t tell me what you have in your shirt,â€ I said, noting a suspicious bulge or two. â€œI donâ€™t want to be an accessory to crime. No, waitâ€”is it alive?â€

Germain prodded the bulge, as though not quite sure, but it didnâ€™t move, and he shook his head. â€œNo, Grand-mÃ¨re.â€

â€œGood. Come here and hold this, will you?â€

I handed him my pocket looking glass and, adjusting the tent flap so that a ray of light shone in, then adjusted Germainâ€™s hand so that the reflected light shone directly from the mirror into the affected eye. John yelped slightly when the light struck his eye, but obediently clutched the sides of the cot and didnâ€™t move, though his eye watered terribly. All the better; it would wash out bacteria and perhaps make it easier to move the eyeball.

Denny was most likely right, I thought, selecting my smallest cautery iron and slipping it gently under the lower lid. It was the best thing I could find for the job, being flat, smooth, and spade-shaped. I couldnâ€™t move the globe of the eyeball upward at all; even slight pressure made him go white. I could move it slightly from side to side, and given the sensitivity of Johnâ€™s face just below the eye, I began to form a mental picture of the damage. It was almost certainly what was called a â€œblowoutâ€ fracture, which had cracked the delicate bone of the orbital floor and forced a displaced bit of itâ€”along with part of the inferior rectus muscleâ€”down into the maxillary sinus. The edge of the muscle was caught in the crack, thus immobilizing the eyeball.

â€œBloody, bloody-minded, effing Scot,â€ I said, straightening up.

â€œNot his fault,â€ said John. â€œI provoked him.â€ He sounded excessively cheerful, and I turned a cold look on him.

â€œIâ€™m not any more pleased with you,â€ I informed him. â€œYou arenâ€™t going to like this, and it will serve you right. How in heavenâ€™s name did youâ€”no, donâ€™t tell me now. Iâ€™m busy.â€

He folded his hands across his stomach, looking meek. Germain sniggered, but desisted when I gave him a glare of his own.

Tight-lipped, I filled a syringeâ€”Dr. Fentimanâ€™s penis syringe, as it happened; how appropriateâ€”with saline solution for irrigation and found my small pair of needle-nosed forceps. I had another peek at the site with my makeshift spatula and prepared a tiny, curved needle with a wet catgut suture, cut very fine. I might manage without needing to stitch the inferior rectusâ€”it depended whether the edge of the muscle had frayed very badly, by reason of its long entrapment, and how it survived being dislodgedâ€”but best to have the suture handy, in case of need. I hoped the need wouldnâ€™t occur; there was so much swelling . . . but I couldnâ€™t wait several days for it to subside.

What was troubling me was not so much the immediate reduction of the fracture and freeing of the muscle but the longer-term possibility of adhesion. The eye should be kept fairly immobile, to aid healing, but doing that might cause the muscle to adhere to the orbit, literally freezing the eye permanently. I needed something slippery with which to dress the site, something biologically inert and non-irritatingâ€”in my own time, sterile glycerin drops would have been instantly available, but here . . .

Egg white, perhaps? Probably not, I thought; body heat might coddle it, and then what?

â€œJohn!â€

A shocked voice behind me made me turn, needle in hand. A very dapper-looking gentleman in a stylish wig and a gray-blue velvet suit was standing just inside the tent flap, staring aghast at my patient.

â€œWhatâ€™s happened to him?â€ Percy Beauchamp demanded, spotting me in the background.

â€œNothing serious,â€ I said. â€œAre youâ€”â€

â€œLeave,â€ said John, in a voice Iâ€™d never heard him use before. He sat up, fixing the newcomer with as steely a look as could be managed with one badly watering crimson eye. â€œNow.â€

â€œWhat in Godâ€™s name are you doing here?â€ Beauchamp demanded. His accent was English, but English faintly tinged with French. He took a step nearer and lowered his voice. â€œSurely you have not become a Rebel?â€

â€œNo, I bloody havenâ€™t! Leave, I said.â€

â€œDear God, you mean youâ€”what the devil happened to you?â€ Heâ€™d come close enough now to behold the complete picture: filthy cropped hair, filthy disheveled clothes, filthy stockinged feet with holes in toe and heel, and a distorted visage now directing a glare of bloodshot venom at him.



â€œNow, look hereâ€”â€ I began, turning on Percy with determined firmness, but Germain stopped me.

â€œHeâ€™s the man who was looking for Papa in New Bern last year,â€ Germain said. Heâ€™d put down the looking glass and was watching the evolving scene with interest. â€œGrand-pÃ¨re thinks heâ€™s a villain.â€

Percy cast Germain a startled look, but recovered his composure with remarkable speed.

â€œAh. The proprietor of distinguished frogs,â€ he said, with a smile. â€œI recall. Peter and Simon were their names? One yellow and one green.â€

Germain bowed respectfully.

â€œMonsieur has an excellent memory,â€ he said, with exquisite politeness. â€œWhat do you want with my papa?â€

â€œAn excellent question,â€ said John, putting one hand over his injured eye, the better to glare at Monsieur Beauchamp.

â€œYes, that is a good question,â€ I said mildly. â€œDo sit down, Mr. Beauchampâ€”and bloody explain yourself. And, you,â€ I added, taking John firmly by both shoulders, â€œlie down.â€

â€œThat can wait,â€ John said shortly, resisting my attempt to flatten him. He swung his legs over the side of the cot. â€œWhat are you doing here, Percy?â€

â€œOh, you know him, do you?â€ I said, beginning to be provoked.

â€œCertainly. Heâ€™s my brotherâ€”or was.â€

â€œWhat?â€ Germain and I exclaimed as one. He looked at me and giggled.

â€œI thought Hal was your only brother,â€ I said, recovering. I glanced back and forth between John and Percy. There was no resemblance at all between them, whereas Johnâ€™s resemblance to Hal was as marked as if theyâ€™d been stamped from the same mold.

â€œStepbrother,â€ John said, still more shortly. He got his feet under him, preparing to rise. â€œCome with me, Percy.â€

â€œYouâ€™re not going anywhere,â€ I said, raising my voice slightly.

â€œHow do you propose to stop me?â€ John was on his feet, staggering a little as he tried to focus his eyes. Before I could answer, Mr. Beauchamp had lunged forward and grabbed his arm, to keep him from falling. John jerked violently away from him, nearly falling again as he stumbled backward into the cot. He caught his balance and stood glowering at Beauchamp, his fists half clenched.

Beauchampâ€™s gaze was locked with his, and the air between them was . . . electric. Oh, I thought, glancing from one to the other, suddenly enlightened. Oh.

I must have made some small movement, because Beauchampâ€™s gaze flicked suddenly toward my face. He looked startled at whatever he saw there, then, recovering himself, smiled wryly and bowed.

â€œMadame,â€ he said. Then, in perfect, accentless English, â€œHe is really my stepbrother, though we havenâ€™t spoken in . . . some time. I am here as the guest of the Marquis de La Fayetteâ€”amongst other things. Do allow me to take his lordship to meet the marquis. I promise to bring him back in one piece.â€ He smiled at me, warm-eyed and sure of his charm, which was considerable.



â€œHis lordship is a prisoner of war,â€ said a very dry Scottish voice from behind Beauchamp. â€œAnd my responsibility. I regret that he must remain here, sir.â€

Percy Beauchamp whirled round, gaping at Jamie, who was filling the tent flap in a most implacable fashion.

â€œI still want to know what he wants with Papa,â€ Germain said, small blond brows drawn down in a suspicious glower.

â€œI should like to know that, too, monsieur,â€ Jamie said. He came into the tent, ducking, and nodded toward the stool I had been using. â€œPray be seated, sir.â€

Percy Beauchamp glanced from Jamie to Lord John and back again. His face had gone smooth and blank, though the lively dark eyes were full of calculation.

â€œAlas,â€ he said, the slight French accent back. â€œI am engaged to le marquisâ€”and General Washingtonâ€”just now. You will excuse me, I am sure. Bonjour, Mon GÃ©nÃ©ral.â€ He marched to the tent flap, head held high, turning at the last moment to smile at John. â€œAu revoir, mon frÃ¨re.â€

â€œNot if I bloody see you first.â€



NOBODY MOVED FOR the space of nine heartbeatsâ€”I counted themâ€”following Percy Beauchampâ€™s dignified exit. Finally, John sat down abruptly on the cot, exhaling audibly. Jamie caught my eye and, with a slight nod, sat down on the stool. Nobody spoke.

â€œYou mustnâ€™t hit him again, Grand-pÃ¨re,â€ Germain said earnestly, breaking the silence. â€œHeâ€™s a very good man, and Iâ€™m sure he wonâ€™t take Grannie to bed anymore, now that youâ€™re home to do it.â€

Jamie gave Germain a quelling look, but his mouth twitched. From my position behind the cot, I could see the back of Johnâ€™s neck flush a deep pink.

â€œIâ€™m much obliged to his lordship for his care of your grannie,â€ Jamie told Germain. â€œBut if ye think makinâ€™ impertinent remarks regarding your elders is going to save your arseâ€”think again.â€

Germain shifted uneasily, but rolled his eyes at Lord John in a â€œworth a tryâ€ sort of way.

â€œIâ€™m obliged to you for your good opinion, sir,â€ John told him. â€œAnd I reciprocate the complimentâ€”but I trust you are aware that good intent alone does not absolve one from the consequences of rash conduct.â€

Jamie was beginning to flush as deeply as John.

â€œGermain,â€ I said. â€œDo go away. Ohâ€”see if you can find me some honey, would you?â€

All three of them looked at me, startled at this apparent non sequitur.

â€œItâ€™s viscous,â€ I said, with a slight shrug. â€œAnd antibacterial.â€

â€œOf course it is,â€ John said under his breath in a hopeless sort of way.

â€œWhat does â€˜viscousâ€™ mean?â€ Germain asked, interested.

â€œGermain,â€ said his grandfather, in a menacing tone, and he hastily disappeared without waiting for enlightenment.



Everyone took a deep breath.

â€œLie down now,â€ I said to John, before anything regrettable might be said. â€œHave you got a moment, Jamie? I need someone to hold the mirror while I fix his eye.â€

With no more than an instantâ€™s hesitation, they both obeyed, not looking at each other. I was nearly ready; when Iâ€™d got Jamie positioned and the ray of light focused on the eye, I once more irrigated the eye and socket gently with saline solution, then rinsed my fingers thoroughly with the same stuff.

â€œI need you both to hold completely still,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™m sorry, John, but thereâ€™s no other way to do this, and if weâ€™re lucky, it will be quick.â€

â€œAye, Iâ€™ve heard that one before,â€ Jamie muttered, but desisted when I shot a sideways look at him.

I was afraid to use the forceps, for fear of puncturing his eyeball. So I spread the lids of Johnâ€™s affected eye with the fingers of my left hand, wedged the fingertips of my right as deeply into the eye socket as I could, and squeezed.

He made a shocked, strangled sort of noise, and Jamie gasped but didnâ€™t drop the mirror.

There are not many things in the world slipperier than a wet eyeball. I tried to squeeze as lightly as I could, but there was no help for it; a light pressure merely allowed the eyeball to pop out of my fingers like an oiled grape. I clenched my teeth and tried again, gripping harder.

On the fourth try, I managed to get a sufficient grip as to allow me to try to rotate the eyeball in its socket. I didnâ€™t quite manage it, but at least got a better idea of how it might go.

Five minutes later, John was trembling like a blancmange, hands clenched tight on the rails of the cot, Jamie was praying under his breath in Gaelic, and all three of us were drenched with sweat.

â€œOnce more,â€ I said, drawing breath and wiping sweat from my chin with the back of my hand. I rinsed my fingers again. â€œIf I canâ€™t get it this time, weâ€™ll have a rest and try again later.â€

â€œOh, God,â€ said John. He closed both eyes briefly, swallowed hard, and opened them as wide as he could. Both eyes were watering badly, and tears washed down his temples.

I felt Jamie move slightly next to me. He refocused the mirrorâ€”but I saw that he had also moved nearer to the cot, so that his leg pressed against the rail, just next to Johnâ€™s gripping fingers. I wiggled my wet fingers in preparation, said a brief prayer to St. Claire, patron of sore eyes, and thrust my fingers as deeply into the socket as I could manage.

By this time, I had a very clear mental image of the fracture, a dark line beneath the torn conjunctiva, and the line of the inferior rectus muscle wedged into it. I twisted, a short, sharp jerk, before my fingers slippedâ€”and felt the muscle pop free. John shuddered the full length of his body and gave a little moan.

â€œGlory be,â€ I said, and laughed from sheer relief. There was a little bloodâ€”not muchâ€”on my fingers, and I wiped them on my apron. Jamie flinched and looked away.



â€œNow what?â€ he asked, carefully not looking at John.

â€œNow whatâ€”Oh.â€ I considered that one for a moment, then shook my head.

â€œHe has to lie down for several hours with the eye coveredâ€”a day or two, ideally. If Germain finds me some honey, Iâ€™ll lubricate the eye socket with a bit of it, to prevent adhesion.â€

â€œI mean,â€ Jamie said patiently, â€œdoes he require to be kept under a doctorâ€™s care?â€

â€œNot all the time,â€ I said, surveying John critically. â€œSomeoneâ€”me, I meanâ€”needs to check the eye every so often, but thereâ€™s really nothing else to be done for it; the swelling and bruises will take care of themselves. Why? What were you planning to do with him?â€

Jamie made a small gesture of frustration.

â€œI would hand him over to Washingtonâ€™s staff for interrogation,â€ he said. â€œButâ€”â€

â€œBut I surrendered to you personally,â€ John said helpfully. He glanced at me out of his working eye. â€œThat means Iâ€™m his responsibility.â€

â€œAye, thank ye for that,â€ Jamie muttered, giving him an irritable look.

â€œWell, you arenâ€™t going to tell him anything useful, either, are you?â€ I asked, putting a hand on Johnâ€™s forehead. Slightly warm, but no gross fever. â€œSuch as the nature of the relations between yourself and the recent Mr. Beauchamp?â€

Jamie gave a brief snort.

â€œI ken fine what his relations are wiâ€™ that wee sodomite,â€ he said bluntly. He gave John a piercing stare. â€œYe dinna mean to tell me what heâ€™s doing here, do ye?â€

â€œNo,â€ John said cheerfully. â€œThough it almost certainly wouldnâ€™t help you if I did.â€

Jamie nodded, having evidently expected nothing better, and rose with an air of decision.

â€œWell, then. Iâ€™ve work to do, and so have you, Sassenach. Wait here for Germain, if ye will, and when yeâ€™ve finished with the honey, tell Germain heâ€™s to be in charge of his lordship. Heâ€™s no to leave his lordship under any circumstances, save you or I tell him he mayâ€”and should Monsieur Beauchamp pay another call, Germain is to be present at any conversation. He speaks French verra fluently,â€ he advised John. â€œAnd should ye think of attempting to subvert my grandsonâ€™s loyaltyâ€”â€

â€œSir!â€ John said, looking shocked at the mere idea.

â€œMmphm,â€ Jamie said darkly, and left.





THE MULE DISLIKES YOU

I DIDNâ€™T KNOW QUITE what to say to John, in the wake of recent events. He seemed similarly at a loss, but coped with the social awkwardness by closing his eyes and pretending to be asleep. I couldnâ€™t leave him until Germain got back with the honeyâ€”assuming he found any, but I had a fair amount of faith in his abilities.

Well, no point in sitting about with my hands folded. I took out my mortar and pestle and set to work grinding gentian root and garlic for antibiotic ointment. This occupied my hands, but unfortunately not my mind, which was scampering in circles like a hamster on a wheel.

I had two main anxieties at the moment, one of which I could do nothing about: that being the escalating sense of oncoming battle. I knew it very well; I couldnâ€™t be mistaken. Jamie hadnâ€™t told me explicitly, perhaps because he hadnâ€™t had written orders yetâ€”but I knew as clearly as if it had been shouted by a town crier. The army would move soon.

I stole a glance at John, who lay like a tomb effigy, hands neatly crossed at his waist. All it wanted was a small dog curled up at his feet. Rollo, snoring under the cot, would have to do, I supposed.

John, of course, was the other anxiety. I had no idea how heâ€™d come to be where he was, but enough people had seen him surrender that his presence would be common knowledge by nightfall. And once it was . . .

â€œI donâ€™t suppose youâ€™d consider escaping, if I left for a moment?â€ I asked abruptly.

â€œNo,â€ he said, not opening his eyes. â€œI gave my parole. Besides, I wouldnâ€™t make it outside the camp,â€ he added.

The silence resumed, broken by the brumm of a large bumblebee, which had blundered into the tent, and the more distant shouts and drumbeats of soldiers drilling and the low thrashing noises of daily camp life.

The only good thingâ€”if one chose to regard it that way, and I might as wellâ€”was that the rising sense of battle urgency was likely to preclude official curiosity about John. What the devil would Jamie do with him when the army decamped in the morning? I wondered.

â€œGrand-mÃ¨re, Grand-mÃ¨re!â€ Germain burst into the tent, and Rolloâ€”who had slept through Percy Beauchampâ€™s visit without stirring a whiskerâ€”shot out from under the cot with an explosive WOOF! that nearly overturned the cot and John with it.

â€œHush, dog,â€ I said, seeing him glaring wildly round, and took a restraining grip on his scruff. â€œAnd what the heâ€”I mean the devâ€”I mean whatâ€™s the matter, Germain?â€

â€œI saw him, Grannie! I saw him! The man who took Clarence! Come quick!â€ And without waiting for response, he turned and raced out of the tent.

John began to sit up, and Rollo tensed under my hand.

â€œSit!â€ I said to both of them. â€œAnd bloody stay!â€



THE HAIRS ON my forearms were prickling, even as sweat streamed down my neck. Iâ€™d left my hat behind and the sun blazed on my cheeks; I was panting by the time I caught up with Germain, as much from emotion as from heat.

â€œWhereâ€”â€

â€œJust there, Grannie! The big bugger wiâ€™ the kerchief round his arm. Clarence must haâ€™ bitten him!â€ Germain added, with glee.

The bugger in question was big: roughly twice my size, with a head like a pumpkin. He was sitting on the ground under the shade of what I thought of as the hospital tree, nursing his kerchief-wrapped arm and glowering at nothing in particular. A small group of people seeking medical treatmentâ€”you could tell as much from their hunched and drooping attitudesâ€”was keeping a distance from him, looking warily at him from time to time.

â€œYouâ€™d best keep out of sight,â€ I murmured to Germain, but, hearing no answer, glanced round to discover that heâ€™d already faded artfully from view, canny child that he was.

I walked up, smiling, to the little group of waiting peopleâ€”mostly women with children. I didnâ€™t know any of them by name, but they clearly knew who and what I was; they bobbed their heads and murmured greetings, but cut their eyes sideways at the man under the tree. â€œTake him first before he does something messyâ€ was the clear message. Just as clear as the sense of badly contained violence that the man was radiating in all directions.

I cleared my throat and walked over to the man, wondering what on earth I was to say to him. â€œWhat have you done with Clarence the mule?â€ or â€œHow dare you rob my grandson and leave him in the wilderness alone, you bloody bastard?â€

I settled for â€œGood morning. Iâ€™m Mrs. Fraser. What happened to your arm, sir?â€

â€œBleedinâ€™ mule bit me to the bone, gaddamn his stinkinâ€™ hide,â€ the man replied promptly, and glowered at me under eyebrows ridged with scar tissue. So were his knuckles.

â€œLet me see it, will you?â€ Not waiting for permission, I took hold of his wristâ€”it was hairy and very warmâ€”and unwrapped the kerchief. This was stiff with dried blood, and no wonder.

Clarenceâ€”if it was Clarenceâ€”actually had bitten him to the bone. Horse and mule bites could be serious but usually resulted only in deep bruising; equines had powerful jaws, but their front teeth were designed for tearing grass, and as most bites were through clothing, they didnâ€™t often break skin. It could be done, though, and Clarence had done it.



A flap of skinâ€”and a good chunk of fleshâ€”about three inches wide had been partially detached, and I could see past the thin fatty layer to the gleam of tendon and the red membranous covering of the radius. The wound was recent but had stopped bleeding, save for a little oozing at the edges.

â€œHmm,â€ I said noncommittally, and turned his hand over. â€œCan you close your fingers into a fist?â€ He could, though the ring finger and little finger wouldnâ€™t fold in completely. They did move, though; the tendon wasnâ€™t severed. â€œHmm,â€ I said again, and reached into my bag for the bottle of saline solution and a probe. Saline was a little less painful for disinfection than dilute alcohol or vinegarâ€”and it was somewhat easier to get hold of salt, at least when living in a cityâ€”but I kept a tight grip on the enormous wrist as I poured the liquid into the wound.

He made a noise like a wounded bear, and the waiting onlookers took several steps back, as a body.

â€œRather a vicious mule,â€ I observed mildly, as the patient subsided, panting. His face darkened.

â€œGonna beat the gaddamn bastarding fucker to death, soon as I get back,â€ he said, and bared his yellow teeth at me. â€œSkin him, I will, and sell his meat.â€

â€œOh, I wouldnâ€™t advise that,â€ I said, keeping a grip on my temper. â€œYou donâ€™t want to be using that arm violently; it could bring on gangrene.â€

â€œIt could?â€ He didnâ€™t go paleâ€”it wasnâ€™t possible, given the temperatureâ€”but Iâ€™d definitely got his attention.

â€œYes,â€ I said pleasantly. â€œYouâ€™ve seen gangrene, I daresay? The flesh goes green and putridâ€”beastly smellâ€”limb rots, dead in days . . . that sort of thing?â€

â€œI seen it,â€ he muttered, eyes now fixed on his arm.

â€œWell, well,â€ I said soothingly, â€œweâ€™ll do our best here, wonâ€™t we?â€ I would normally have offered a patient in such a case a fortifying draft of whatever liquor was availableâ€”and, thanks to the marquis, I had quite a good supply of French brandyâ€”but in the present instance, I wasnâ€™t feeling charitable.

In fact, my general feeling was that Hippocrates could turn a blind eye for the next few minutes. Do no harm, forsooth. Still, there wasnâ€™t a great deal I could do to him, armed with a two-inch suture needle and a pair of embroidery scissors.

I stitched the wound as slowly as I could, taking care to slosh more saline over it periodically and glancing covertly round for assistance. Jamie was with Washington and the high command as they strategized the imminent engagement; I couldnâ€™t summon him out to deal with a mule thief.

Ian had vanished on his pony, scouting the British rear guard. Rollo was with Lord John. Rachel had gone off with Denny and Dottie in the Quakersâ€™ wagon, to look for supplies in the nearest village. And good luck to them, I thought; General Greeneâ€™s foragers had spread out like locusts over the face of the earth the moment the army halted, stripping farmsteads and storage barns in their path.

The patient was cursing in a rather monotonous and uninspired fashion, but showed no signs of keeling over in a convenient faint. What I was doing to his arm was unlikely to improve his temper; what if he actually did intend to go straight off and beat Clarence to death?



If Clarence was loose, Iâ€™d put good odds on the mule to win any such encounter, but he was very likely tied or hobbled. But then . . . a horrid thought struck me. I knew where Germain was, and what he was doingâ€”or trying to do.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,â€ I muttered, bending my head over the teamsterâ€™s arm to hide an undoubtedly appalled expression. Germain was an extremely talented pickpocket, but stealing a mule out of the middle of a gang of teamsters . . .

What had Jamie said? â€œHeâ€™d be taken up for theft and hanged or flogged within an inch of his life, and I couldna do a thing to stop it.â€ Teamsters being what they were, theyâ€™d likely just break his neck and be done with it, rather than waiting for any sort of military justice.

I swallowed hard and glanced quickly over my shoulder, to see if I could spot the teamstersâ€™ encampment. If I could see Germain . . .

I didnâ€™t see Germain. What I saw was Percy Beauchamp, regarding me thoughtfully from the shadow of a nearby tent. Our eyes met, and he instantly came toward me, straightening his coat. Well, I was in no position to look a gift horseâ€”or muleâ€”in the mouth, was I?

â€œMadame Fraser,â€ he said, and bowed. â€œAre you in need of some assistance?â€

Yes, I bloody did need assistance; I couldnâ€™t drag my surgical repairs out much longer. I darted a look at my massive patient, wondering whether he had any French.

Apparently my face was just as transparent as Jamie had always told me it was; Percy smiled at me and said conversationally in French, â€œI donâ€™t think this clot of decaying menstrual blood is capable of understanding more English than it takes to hire the sort of poxed and imbecile whore who would let him touch her, let alone understand the tongue of angels.â€

The teamster went on muttering, â€œShit-fire, shit-fire, fucking shit-ass fucking-ass mule, that gaddamn hurts . . .â€

I relaxed a little and replied in French. â€œYes, I need helpâ€”with the utmost urgency. My grandson is trying to steal the mule this oaf stole from him. Can you retrieve him from the teamstersâ€™ camp before someone notices?â€

â€œÃ€ votre service, madame,â€ he replied promptly, and, clicking his heels smartly together, bowed and went off.



I TOOK AS long as I could over the final dressing of the wound, worried that should my foul-mouthed patient find Germain among the teamsters, Percyâ€™s French manners might be unequal to the occasion. And I couldnâ€™t really expect Hippocrates to continue turning a blind eye, were I compelled to do something drastic if the man tried to break Germainâ€™s neck.

I heard a familiar loud braying behind me, though, and turned sharply to see Percy, flushed and a trifle disheveled, leading Clarence toward me. Germain sat atop the mule, his face set in lines of vindictive triumph as he glared at my patient.

I stood up hastily, groping for my knife. The teamster, who had been gingerly prodding the fresh bandage round his arm, looked up, startled, then surged to his feet with a roar.

â€œShit-FIRE!â€ he said, and started purposefully toward them, fists clenched. Percy, to his credit, stood his ground, though he paled a little. He handed the reins up to Germain, though, and stepped firmly forward.

â€œMonsieur . . .â€ he began. I would have liked to know just what he had in mind to say but didnâ€™t find out, as the teamster didnâ€™t bother with colloquy, instead driving a hamlike fist into Percyâ€™s belly. Percy sat down hard and folded up like a fan.

â€œBloody hellâ€”Germain!â€ For Germain, nothing daunted by the sudden loss of support, had gathered up Clarenceâ€™s reins and tried to lash the teamster across the face with them.

This might possibly have been effective, had he not telegraphed his intention quite so clearly. As it was, the teamster ducked and reached out, clearly intending to grab either the reins or Germain. The crowd around me had realized what was happening by now, and women started screaming. At this point, Clarence decided to become involved and, laying back his ears, curled his lips and snapped at the teamsterâ€™s face, coming within a toucher of taking off the manâ€™s nose.

â€œSHIT-ASS FUCKING MULE!!â€ Deeply inflamed, the teamster leapt at Clarence and fixed his teeth in the muleâ€™s upper lip, clinging like grim death to his neck. Clarence screamed. The women screamed. Germain screamed.

I didnâ€™t scream, because I couldnâ€™t breathe. I was elbowing my way through the crowd, fumbling for the slit in my skirt so I could reach my knife. Just as I laid my hand on the hilt, though, a hand came down on my shoulder, halting me in my tracks.

â€œPardon me, milady,â€ said Fergus, and, stepping purposefully past me, walked up beside the lunging mass of mule, teamster, and shrieking child, and fired the pistol in his hand.

Everything stopped, for a split second, and then the shouting and screaming started again, everyone surging toward Clarence and his companions to see what had happened. For a long moment, it wasnâ€™t apparent what had happened. The teamster had let go his grip in astonishment and turned toward Fergus, eyes bulging and blood-tinged saliva running down his chin. Germain, with more presence of mind than I would have had in such a situation, got hold of the reins and was hauling on them with all his strength, trying to turn Clarenceâ€™s head. Clarence, whose blood was plainly up, was having none of it.

Fergus calmly put the fired pistol back into his beltâ€”I realized at this point that he must have fired into the dirt near the teamsterâ€™s feetâ€”and spoke to the man.

â€œIf I were you, sir, I would remove myself promptly from this animalâ€™s presence. It is apparent that he dislikes you.â€

The shouting and screaming had stopped, and this made several people laugh.

â€œGot you there, Belden!â€ a man near me called. â€œThe mule dislikes you. What you think of that?â€

The teamster looked mildly dazed but still homicidal. He stood with his fists clenched, legs braced wide apart and shoulders hunched, glowering at the crowd.

â€œWhat I think . . . ?â€ he began. â€œI thinkâ€”â€

But Percy had managed to get to his feet and, while still somewhat hunched, was mobile. Without hesitation, he walked up and kicked the teamster smartly in the balls.

This went over well. Even the man who appeared to be a friend of Beldenâ€™s whooped with laughter. The teamster didnâ€™t go down but curled up like a dried leaf, clutching himself. Percy wisely didnâ€™t wait for him to recover, but turned and bowed to Fergus.

â€œÃ€ votre service, monsieur. I suggest that you and your sonâ€”and the mule, of courseâ€”might withdraw?â€

â€œMerci beaucoup, and I suggest you do the same, tout de suite,â€ Fergus replied.

â€œHey!â€ shouted the teamsterâ€™s friend, not laughing now. â€œYou canâ€™t steal that mule!â€

Fergus rounded on him, imperious as the French aristocrat Percy had implied he might be.

â€œI cannot, sir,â€ he said, inclining his head a quarter of an inch in acknowledgment. â€œBecause a man cannot steal that which already belongs to him, is this not so?â€

â€œIs that not . . . is what not so?â€ demanded the man, confused.

Fergus scorned to answer this. Lifting one dark brow, he strode off several paces, turned, and shouted, â€œClarence! Ã‰coutez-moi!â€

With the teamsterâ€™s collapse, Germain had succeeded in getting Clarence somewhat under control, though the muleâ€™s ears were still laid out flat in displeasure. At the sound of Fergusâ€™s voice, though, the ears rose slowly upright and swiveled in his direction.

Fergus smiled, and I heard a woman behind me sigh involuntarily. Fergusâ€™s smile was remarkably charming. He reached into his pocket and withdrew an apple, which he skewered neatly on his hook.

â€œCome,â€ he said to the mule, extending his right hand and twiddling the fingers in a head-scratching motion. Clarence came, disregarding Mr. Belden, who had now sat down and was clutching his knees, the better to contemplate his state of inner being. The mule ducked his head to take the apple, nudging Fergusâ€™s elbow, and allowed his forehead to be scratched. There was a murmur of interest and approbation from the crowd, and I noticed a few censorious glances being shot at the groaning Mr. Belden.

The sense of being about to faint had left me, and now my insides began to unclench. With some effort, I slid the knife back into its sheath without stabbing myself in the thigh and wiped my hand on my skirt.

â€œAs for you, sans crevelle,â€ Fergus was saying to Germain, with a low-voiced menace that heâ€™d plainly learned from Jamie, â€œwe have a few things to discuss presently.â€

Germain turned a rather sickly shade of yellow. â€œYes, Papa,â€ he murmured, hanging his head in order to avoid his fatherâ€™s minatory eye.

â€œGet down,â€ Fergus said to him, and, turning to me, raised his voice. â€œMadame General, permit me to present this animal personally to General Fraser, in the service of liberty!â€

This was delivered in such a tone of ringing sincerity that a few souls applauded. I accepted, as graciously as possible, on behalf of General Fraser. By the conclusion of these proceedings, Mr. Belden had got awkwardly to his feet and stumbled off toward the teamstersâ€™ camp, tacitly ceding Clarence to the cause.

I took Clarenceâ€™s reins, relieved and glad to see him again. Apparently it was mutual, for he nosed me familiarly in the shoulder and made chummy huffing noises.

Fergus, meanwhile, stood for a moment looking down at Germain, then squared his shoulders and turned to Percy, who still looked a little pale but had straightened his wig and regained his self-possession. Percy bowed very formally to Fergus, who sighed deeply, then bowed back.

â€œAnd I suppose that we, too, have matters to discuss, monsieur,â€ he said, resigned. â€œPerhaps a little later?â€

Percyâ€™s handsome face lighted.

â€œÃ€ votre service . . . seigneur,â€ he said, and bowed again.





AN ALTERNATE USE FOR A PENIS SYRINGE

GERMAIN HAD, IN FACT, found some honey, and now that the excitement of recovering Clarence was over, he produced a large chunk of sticky honeycomb, wrapped in a dirty black kerchief, from the recesses of his shirt.

â€œWhat are you going to do wiâ€™ that, Grannie?â€ he asked, curious. Iâ€™d set the oozing chunk of comb in a clean pottery dish and was again employing the useful penis syringeâ€”carefully sterilized with alcoholâ€”to suck up honey, being careful to avoid bits of wax and noticeable pollen grains. Having been designed for irrigation rather than puncture, the syringe had a blunt, smoothly tapered tip: just the thing for dribbling honey into someoneâ€™s eye.

â€œIâ€™m going to lubricate his lordshipâ€™s bad eye,â€ I said. â€œFergus, will you come and steady his lordshipâ€™s head, please? Put your hand on his forehead. And, Germain, youâ€™ll hold his eyelids open.â€



â€œI can keep still,â€ John said irritably.

â€œBe quiet,â€ I said briefly, and sat down on the stool beside him. â€œNo one can keep still while having things poked into their eye.â€

â€œYou were poking your bloody fingers into my eye not an hour since! And I didnâ€™t move!â€

â€œYou squirmed,â€ I said. â€œItâ€™s not your fault, you couldnâ€™t help it. Now, be quiet; I donâ€™t want to accidentally stab you in the eyeball with this.â€

Breathing audibly through his nose, he clamped his mouth shut and suffered Fergus and Germain to immobilize him. Iâ€™d debated whether to dilute the honey with boiled water, but the heat of the day had made it sufficiently thin that I thought it better to use it at full strength.

â€œItâ€™s antibacterial,â€ I explained to the three of them, using my cautery iron again to lift the eyeball and squirting a slow dribble of honey under it. â€œThat means it kills germs.â€

Fergus and Germain, to whom I had explained germs more than once, nodded intelligently and tried to look as though they believed in the existence of such things, which they didnâ€™t. John opened his mouth as though to speak, but then shut it again and exhaled strongly through his nose.

â€œBut the chief virtue of honey in the present instance,â€ I went on, anointing the eyeball generously, â€œis that itâ€™s viscous. Let go now, Germain. Blink, John. Oh, very good!â€ The handling had of course made the eye water, but even dilute honey retains its viscosity; I could see the altered gleam of the light across the sclera, indicating the presence of a thin, soothingâ€”I hopedâ€”layer of honey. Some had overflowed, of course, and amber beads were sliding down his temple toward his ear; I stanched the flow with a handkerchief.

â€œHow does it feel?â€

John opened and closed his eye a couple of times, very slowly.

â€œEverything looks blurry.â€

â€œDoesnâ€™t matter; you arenâ€™t going to be looking out of that eye for a day or two anyway. Does it feel any better?â€

â€œYes,â€ he said, in a distinctly grudging manner, and the other three of us made approving noises that made him look embarrassed.

â€œRight, then. Sit upâ€”carefully! Yes, thatâ€™s it. Close your eye and hold this to catch the drips.â€ And, handing him a clean handkerchief, I unrolled a length of gauze bandage, thumbed a pad of lint carefully into the eye socket, and rolled the bandage round his head a few times, tucking in the ends. He strongly resembled a figure in an old painting titled The Spirit of â€™76, but I didnâ€™t mention it.

â€œAll right,â€ I said, exhaling and feeling rather pleased with myself. â€œFergus, why donâ€™t you and Germain go and find some food? Something for his lordship, and something for the road tomorrow. I rather think it will be a long day.â€

â€œThis oneâ€™s been quite long enough already,â€ John said. He was swaying a little, and I pushed him gently back down with little resistance. He stretched his neck to ease it, then settled on the pillow with a sigh. â€œThank you.â€

â€œIt was my pleasure,â€ I assured him. I hesitated, but, with Fergusâ€™s departure, I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d have a better chance to ask what was in my mind. â€œI donâ€™t suppose you know what Percival Beauchamp wants with Fergus, do you?â€

The good eye opened and looked at me.

â€œYou mean you donâ€™t think he believes Fergus to be the lost heir to a great fortune? No, I donâ€™t, either. But if Mr. Fraser will take a bit of unsolicited advice, Iâ€™d strongly suggest having as little as possible to do with Monsieur Beauchamp.â€ The eye closed again.

Percy Beauchamp had taken his leaveâ€”very gracefullyâ€”after Clarenceâ€™s rescue, explaining that he must attend le marquis but adding that he would seek out Fergus on the morrow.

â€œWhen things are quieter,â€ heâ€™d added, with a genteel bow.

I regarded John thoughtfully.

â€œWhat did he do to you?â€ I asked. He didnâ€™t open his eye, but his lips tightened.

â€œTo me? Nothing. Nothing at all,â€ he repeated, and turned over on his side with his back to me.





THREE HUNDRED AND ONE

THREE HUNDRED MEN. Jamie stepped into the darkness beyond the 16th New Jerseyâ€™s campfire and paused for a moment to let his eyes adjust. Three hundred bloody men. Heâ€™d never led a band of more than fifty. And never had much in the way of subalterns, no more than one or two men under him.

Now he had ten militia companies, each with its own captain and a few informally appointed lieutenants, and Lee had given him a staff of his own: two aides-de-camp, a secretaryâ€”now, that he could get used to, he thought, flexing the fingers of his maimed right handâ€”three captains, one of whom was striding along at his shoulder, trying not to look worrit, ten of his own lieutenants, who would serve as liaison between him and the companies under his command, a cook, an assistant cookâ€”and, of course, he had a surgeon already.

Despite the preoccupations of the moment, the memory of Leeâ€™s face when Jamieâ€™d told him exactly why he didnâ€™t need an army surgeon assigned to him made him smile.

â€œIndeed,â€ Lee had said, his long-nosed face going blank. Then heâ€™d gathered his wits and gone red in the face, thinking himself practiced upon. But Jamie had pushed back his cuff and shown Lee his right hand, the old white scars on his fingers like tiny starbursts where the bones had come through, and the broad one, still red but neat, straight, and beautifully knit, running down between the middle finger and the little one, showing where the missing finger had been amputated with such skill that one had to look twice to see why the hand seemed strange.

â€œWell, General, your wife seems a most accomplished needlewoman,â€ Lee said, now amused.

â€œAye, sir, she is,â€ heâ€™d said politely. â€œAnd a verra bonny hand with a blade, too.â€

Lee gave him a sardonic look and spread out the fingers of his own right hand; the outer two were missing.

â€œSo was the gentleman who took these off me. A duel,â€ he added offhandedly, seeing Jamieâ€™s raised brows, and curled up his hand again. â€œIn Italy.â€

He didnâ€™t know about Lee. The man had a reputation, but he was a boaster, and the two didnâ€™t often go together. On the other hand, he was proud as one of Louisâ€™s camels, and arrogance sometimes did mark a man who kent his worth.

The plan to attack the British rear guard, at first intended as a quick strike by La Fayette and a thousand menâ€”Lee scorning such a minor commandâ€”had grown more elaborate, as such things always did if you gave commanders time to think about them. Once Washington had decided that the expeditionary force should be five thousand men, Lee had graciously condescended to this more appropriate commandâ€”leaving La Fayette in charge of his own smaller force, for the sake of the marquisâ€™s amour-propre, but with Lee in command overall. Jamie had his doubts, but it wasnâ€™t his place to voice them.

He glanced to his left, where Ian and his dog were ambling along, the former whistling to himself and the latter a huge, shaggy shape in the dark, panting from the heat.

â€œIain,â€ he said casually in GÃ idhlig, â€œdid your friends with the feathers have aught to say about Ounewaterika?â€

â€œThey had, Uncle,â€ Ian replied in the same language. â€œNot much, though, for they know him only by repute. Heâ€™s a most ferocious fighter, or so itâ€™s said.â€

â€œMmphm.â€ The Mohawk were certainly ferocious and did set great store by personal courageâ€”but he thought they had a negligible grasp of strategy, tactics, and judgment. He was about to ask about Joseph Brant, who was likely the closest thing to a generalâ€”in the formal senseâ€”among the Mohawk, but was interrupted by a tall, gangling form stepping out in front of him.

â€œI beg your pardon, sir. Might I have a word?â€ the man said, and, looking right and left at Jamieâ€™s companions, added, â€œA private word.â€

â€œCertainly, Captain . . . Woodsworth,â€ he replied, hoping his hesitation in finding the manâ€™s name was small enough to pass unnoticed. Heâ€™d memorized all the militia captains as he met themâ€”and as many men as he couldâ€”but their names wouldnâ€™t come easy to him for a bit yet.



After a momentâ€™s further hesitation, he nodded to Ian to go on with Captain Whewell to the next fire.

â€œTell them whatâ€™s afoot, Captain,â€ he said, for the next fire was one of Whewellâ€™s assigned companies, â€œbut wait for me there, aye?â€

â€œWhatâ€™s afoot?â€ Woodsworth repeated, sounding alarmed. â€œWhatâ€™s happening? Are we to go now?â€

â€œNot yet, Captain. Come aside, aye? Else weâ€™ll be trampled.â€ For they were standing in the path that led from the fires to a set of hastily dug latrine trenches; he could smell the acrid tang of ordure and quicklime from here.

Leading Woodsworth aside, he acquainted him with the change of commander for the morning, but assured him that this would make no real difference to the militia companies under Jamieâ€™s command; they would receive their orders in the normal way.

He thought privately that it wouldnâ€™t make a difference in how the companies operatedâ€”it might well make a difference as to whether they met battle on the morrow or not, and whether they survived if they didâ€”but there was no telling whether the better odds lay with La Fayette or Lee. Chances were that sheer accident, Fate, or, just possibly, God, would decide.

â€œNow, sir,â€ he said. â€œYe wished to speak wiâ€™ me?â€

â€œOh.â€ Woodsworth inhaled through his nose and straightened himself, hastily retrieving the words of whatever speech heâ€™d composed. â€œYes, sir. I wished to inquire after theâ€”erâ€”the disposition made of Bertram Armstrong.â€

â€œBertram . . . what?â€

â€œThe man you took from myâ€”er, from the lines earlier today, with the little boy.â€

Jamie didnâ€™t know whether to laugh or be annoyed. Bertram?

â€œThe man is well enough disposed for the present, sir. My wifeâ€™s seen to his eye, and heâ€™s been fed.â€

â€œOh.â€ Woodsworth shuffled his feet, but stood his ground. â€œIâ€™m glad of that, sir. But what I meantâ€”I am concerned for him. There is talk about him.â€

â€œIâ€™m sure there is,â€ Jamie said, not bothering to hide the edge in his voice. â€œAnd what is your concern, sir?â€

â€œThey are sayingâ€”the men from Dunningâ€™s companyâ€”that Armstrong is a government spy, that he is a British officer who concealed himself among us. That they found a commission upon him, and correspondence. Iâ€”â€ He paused and gulped breath, the next words coming out in a rush. â€œI cannot believe it of him, sir, nor can any of us. We feel that some mistake must have been made, and weâ€”we wish to say that we hope nothing . . . hasty will be done.â€

â€œNo one has suggested anything of the sort, Captain,â€ Jamie assured him, alarm running down his spine like quicksilver. Only because they havenâ€™t had time. Heâ€™d been able to ignore the thorny problem Grey presented as a prisoner, in the fierce rush of preparation and the fiercer rush of his own feelings, but he couldnâ€™t ignore it much longer. He should have notified La Fayette, Lee, and Washington of Greyâ€™s presence immediately, but had gambled on the confusion of imminent battle to disguise his delay.



His eyes had grown used to the scattered light of stars and fire; he could see Woodsworthâ€™s long face, apologetic but determined.

â€œYes. I hesitate to speak so frankly, sir, but the sorry fact is that when menâ€™s passions run high, regrettable actionsâ€”irretrievable actionsâ€”may be taken.â€ Woodsworth swallowed audibly. â€œI should not like to see that.â€

â€œYe think someone might see fit to take such action? Now?â€ He glanced round at the encircling fires. He could see bodies moving, restless as the flames, dark shadows in the woodsâ€”but he caught no sense of riot, no pulse of anger. A murmur of talk, to be sure, voices raised in excitement, bursts of laughter and even singing, but it was the nervous spirit of anticipation, expectation, not the sullen rumble of a mob.

â€œI am a clergyman, sir.â€ Woodsworthâ€™s voice was stronger now, urgent. â€œI know how men may turn to evil conversation and how quickly such conversation may turn to action. One drink too many, a careless word . . .â€

â€œAye, yeâ€™re right about that,â€ Jamie said. He cursed himself for not having thought of this possibility; heâ€™d let his own feelings cloud his mind. Of course, heâ€™d had no idea when he left Grey that heâ€™d been carrying a commissionâ€”but that was no excuse. â€œIâ€™ve sent word to General Lee about . . . Mr. Armstrong. Should ye hear any more talk about the man, ye might let it be known that the matter is in official hands. That might prevent anything . . . regrettably informal happening.â€

Woodsworthâ€™s sigh of relief was palpable.

â€œYes, sir,â€ he said, with gratitude. â€œI shall certainly let that be known.â€ He stepped aside, bobbing his head, but then stopped, struck by a thought. â€œOh.â€

â€œAye?â€ Jamie spoke impatiently; he felt assailed from all sides by swarms of tiny, stinging troubles, and was inclined to swat this one.

â€œI trust you will forgive my persistence, General. But I just thoughtâ€”the boy who was with Armstrong. Bobby Higgins, heâ€™s called.â€

All Jamieâ€™s senses were instantly alert.

â€œWhat about him?â€

â€œHeâ€”I mean Armstrongâ€”the boy said he was in search of his grandfather, and Armstrong said he knew the manâ€”and that his name was James Fraser. . . .â€

Jamie shut his eyes. If no one lynched John Grey before dawn, he might throttle the man himself.

â€œThe boy is indeed my grandson, Captain,â€ he said, as evenly as he could, opening his eyes. Which means, aye, I ken bloody Bert Armstrong. And if that small bit of information became generally known, there were going to be a lot of very awkward questions asked, by people in a position to demand answers. â€œMy wife is caring for him.â€

â€œOh. Good. I just wished toâ€”â€

â€œTo make known your concern. Aye, Captain. I thank ye. Good night.â€

Woodsworth bowed and stepped back, murmuring, â€œGood night,â€ in his turn, and disappeared into a night that was far from good and getting worse by the moment.

Jamie jerked his coat straight and strode on. Three hundred men to inform and command, to rouse, lead, and control. Three hundred lives in his hands.

Three hundred and bloody one.





MOSQUITOES

JAMIE WALKED INTO the light of the fire quite late, smiled at me, and sat down suddenly.

â€œIs there food?â€ he asked.

â€œThere is, sir,â€ said the woman who was stirring it. â€œAnd youâ€™ll have some, too, maâ€™am,â€ she added firmly, giving me a look that strongly suggested that I was not looking my very best. I wasnâ€™t disposed to care, but accepted with thanks a wooden bowl of something hot and a chunk of bread to eat it with.

I barely noticed what I ate, though I was ravenous. The day had been so filled with activity that I hadnâ€™t had time to eatâ€”would not have eaten at all, in fact, had I not brought food for John, at which point he insisted that I sit down for ten minutes and eat with him. Percy Beauchamp had not come back; that was something on the plus side of the ledger, I supposed.

There had been a couple of dozen men from Jamieâ€™s companies that I rejected by reason of disfirmityâ€”crippled, asthmatic, collapsed with ageâ€”and perhaps three dozen more who were essentially sound but sporting some injury requiring attention, these mostly the result of fistfights or falling down while under the influence of drink. Several of them were still under the influence of drink and had been sent off under guard to sleep it off.

I did wonder for a moment how many men normally went into battle drunk. In all honesty, Iâ€™d be strongly tempted to do it myself, were I required to do what these men were about to do.

There was still a tremendous bustle, but the earlier sense of exhilaration had transmuted into something more concentrated, more focused and sober. Preparations were being made in earnest.

Iâ€™d finished my own, or hoped I had. A small tent for shelter from the blazing sun, packs of medical supplies, surgical kits, each equipped with a jar of wet sutures, a wad of lint for mopping up blood, and a bottle of dilute alcoholâ€”Iâ€™d run out of salt and couldnâ€™t summon the will to badger or beg more from the commissary officer; Iâ€™d try to do it in the morning. And the emergency kit that I carried over my shoulder, no matter what.



I sat close to the fire, but despite that and in spite of the warmth of the night itself, I began to feel chilled and heavy, as though I were slowly ossifying, and only then realized how tired I was. The camp hadnâ€™t gone to sleep entirelyâ€”there was still talk around the fires, and the occasional rasp of a scythe or a sword being sharpened, but the volume had dropped. The atmosphere had settled with the sinking of the moon, even those souls most excited at the prospect of imminent battle succumbing to sleep.

â€œCome and lie down,â€ I said softly to Jamie, and rose from my seat with a muffled groan. â€œIt wonâ€™t be for long, but you need some restâ€”and so do I.â€

â€œAye, all right, but I canna be under canvas,â€ he said, low-voiced, following me. â€œI feel half smothered; couldna breathe in a tent.â€

â€œWell, plenty of room outside,â€ I said, nobly suppressing a twinge at the thought of sleeping on the ground. Fetching a couple of blankets, I followed him, yawning, a little way along the riverbank, until we found a private spot behind the scrim of willows that dragged their leaves in the water.

In fact, it was surprisingly comfortable; there was a thick growth of springy grass on which to spread the blankets, and, so close to the water, the air was at least moving, cool on my skin. I shucked out of my petticoats and took my stays completely off, with a blissful shiver of relief as the coolness stirred gently through my damp shift.

Jamie had stripped to his shirt and was rubbing his face and legs with mosquito ointment, the presence of hordes of these insects accounting for the lack of company near the water. I sat down beside him and helped myself to a small scoop of the mint-smelling grease. Mosquitoes seldom bit me, but that didnâ€™t stop them whining past my ears and poking inquisitively into my mouth and nostrils, which I found disconcerting in the extreme.

I lay back, watching as he finished his more thorough anointing. I could feel the distant approach of morning, but longed all the more for whatever brief oblivion I could get before the sun rose and all hell broke loose.

Jamie closed the tin and stretched out beside me with a low groan, black leaf shadows trembling over the paleness of his shirt. I rolled toward him just as he rolled toward me, and we met with a blind and groping kiss, smiling against each otherâ€™s mouth, wriggling and squirming to find a good way of lying together. Warm as it was, I wanted to be touching him.

He wanted to be touching me, too.

â€œReally?â€ I said, astonished. â€œHow can you possiblyâ€”youâ€™ve been up for hours!â€

â€œNo, only the last minute or two,â€ he assured me. â€œIâ€™m sorry, Sassenach. I ken yeâ€™re tired and I wouldna askâ€”but Iâ€™m desperate.â€ He let go of my bottom long enough to pull up his shirt, and I rather resignedly started disentangling my shift from my legs.

â€œI dinna mind if ye fall asleep while Iâ€™m about my business,â€ he said in my ear, feeling his way one-handed. â€œI willna take long about it. I justâ€”â€

â€œThe mosquitoes will bite your arse,â€ I said, wiggling my own arse into a better position and opening my legs. â€œHadnâ€™t I best put someâ€”oh!â€

â€œOh?â€ he said, sounding pleased. â€œWell, itâ€™s all right if ye want to stay awake, of course . . .â€

I pinched his buttock, hard, and he gave a small yelp, laughed, and licked my ear. The fit was a bit dry, and he fumbled for the tin of mosquito ointment.

â€œAre you sureâ€”â€ I began dubiously. â€œOh!â€ He was already applying the half-liquid ointment, with more enthusiasm than dexterity, but the fact of his enthusiasm was more arousing than skill might have been. Having a small amount of oil of peppermint vigorously applied to oneâ€™s private parts was a rather novel sensation, too.

â€œMake that noise again,â€ he said, breathing heavily in my ear. â€œI like it.â€

He was right; it didnâ€™t take long. He lay half on and half off me, panting, his heart beating slow and hard against my breast. I had my legs wrapped round himâ€”I could feel the flutter of tiny insects on my ankles and bare feet as they swarmed, avid for his unprotected bare fleshâ€”and didnâ€™t mean to let him go. I squeezed him close, rocking gently, slippery and tingling and . . . I didnâ€™t take long, either. My quivering legs relaxed, releasing him.

â€œShall I tell you something?â€ I said, after a bit of mint-scented heavy breathing. â€œThe mosquitoes wonâ€™t bite your cock.â€

â€œI dinna mind if they carry me off to their lair to feed to their bairns,â€ he murmured. â€œCome here, Sassenach.â€

I pushed damp hair out of my face and settled contentedly in the hollow of his shoulder, his arm around me. By now, I had reached that sense of accommodation with the humid atmosphere in which I stopped trying to keep track of my own bodyâ€™s boundaries and simply melted into sleep.

I slept without dreaming and without moving, until a touch of cramp in my left foot roused me enough to shift a little. Jamie raised his arm a bit, then replaced it as I settled again, and I became aware that he wasnâ€™t asleep.

â€œYou . . . all right?â€ I murmured, thick-tongued with drowsiness.

â€œAye, fine,â€ he whispered, and his hand smoothed the hair from my cheek. â€œGo back to sleep, Sassenach. Iâ€™ll wake ye when itâ€™s time.â€

My mouth was sticky, and it took a moment to locate any words.

â€œYou need to sleep, too.â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, soft but definite. â€œNo, I dinna mean to sleep. So close to the battle . . . I have dreams. Iâ€™ve had them the last three nights, and they get worse.â€

My own arm was lying across his midsection; at this, I reached up involuntarily, putting my hand over his heart. I knew heâ€™d dreamedâ€”and I had a very good idea what heâ€™d dreamed about, from the things heâ€™d said in his sleep. And the way heâ€™d wakened, trembling. â€œThey get worse.â€

â€œShh,â€ he said, and bent his head to kiss my hair. â€œDinna fash, a nighean. I want only to lie here wiâ€™ you in my arms, to keep ye safe and watch ye sleep. I can rise then with a clear mind . . . and go to do what must be done.â€





WAR PAINT

â€œNESSUN DORMA.â€ None shall sleep. It was a songâ€”an aria, Brianna had called itâ€”from an opera she knew; sheâ€™d played a part in it at her university, dressed up in Chinese robes. Ian smiled at thought of his cousin, taller than most men, striding up and down on a stage, swishing her silk robes about her; he wished heâ€™d seen that.

Heâ€™d thought of her from the moment heâ€™d opened the little deerskin bag that held his paints. She was a painter, Bree, and a good one. She ground her own pigments, and sheâ€™d made his red ochre for him, and the black and white from charcoal and dried clayâ€”and made for him, too, a deep green from ground malachite, and a brilliant yellow from the gall of the buffalo she and her mother had killed; no other man had such deep colors to his paint, and he wished for a moment that Eats Turtles and some of his other Mohawk clan brothers could be with him to admire them.

The noise of the distant camp was like the singing of cicadas in the trees near a river: a buzz too loud to think through, but one that went away as you got used to it. None shall sleep . . . The women and children, they might sleepâ€”but the whores surely didnâ€™t. Not tonight.

He felt a twitch at the thought, but dismissed it. Thought of Rachel, and dismissed her, too, but reluctantly.

He opened the willow-bark box of deer fat and anointed his face and chest and shoulders with it, slowly, focusing his mind. Normally heâ€™d speak to the spirits of the earth as he did this, and then to his own particular saints, Michael and Bride. But he wasnâ€™t seeing Michael or Bride; Brianna was still faintly with him, but what he was feeling was a strong sense of his da, which was disconcerting.

It didnâ€™t seem respectful to be dismissing his own father. He stopped what he was doing and closed his eyes instead, waiting to see if maybe Da had a thing to tell him.

â€œI hope yeâ€™re no bringing me word of my death, aye?â€ he said aloud. â€œBecause I dinna mean to die until Iâ€™ve lain wiâ€™ Rachel, at least.â€

â€œWell, thereâ€™s a noble goal, to be sure.â€ The dry voice was Uncle Jamieâ€™s, and Ianâ€™s eyes popped open. His uncle was standing among the trailing fronds of a river willow, dressed in nothing but his shirt.

â€œOut of uniform, are ye not, Uncle?â€ he said, though his heart had leapt in his chest like a startled deer mouse. â€œGeneral Washington willna be pleased.â€ Washington was a great stickler for proper uniform. Officers must be dressed suitably at all times; he said the Continentals couldnâ€™t be taken seriously as an army, did they come to the field looking and acting like a rabble in arms.

â€œIâ€™m sorry to interrupt ye, Ian,â€ Uncle Jamie said, stepping out from the willow. The moon was nearly down; he was nay more than a ghost, bare-legged in his floating sark. â€œWho were ye speaking to, though?â€

â€œOh. My da. He was just . . . there in my mind, ken? I mean, I think of him often, but itâ€™s not sae often I feel him with me. So I wondered had he come to tell me Iâ€™d die this day.â€

Jamie nodded, not seeming bothered at the thought.

â€œI doubt it,â€ he said. â€œYeâ€™re putting on your paint, aye? Getting ready, I mean.â€

â€œAye, I was about to. Ye want some, too?â€ It was only half said in jest, and Jamie took it that way.

â€œI would, Ian. But I think General Washington might have me strung up by the thumbs and flogged, should I come before him wiâ€™ my troops all marshaled and me wiâ€™ war paint on.â€

Ian made a small sound of amusement and scooped two fingers into the dish of red ochre, which he began to rub on his chest.

â€œAnd what are ye doinâ€™ out here in your sark, then?â€

â€œWashing,â€ Jamie said, but in a tone indicating that that wasnâ€™t all of it. â€œAnd . . . talkinâ€™ to my ain dead.â€

â€œMmphm. Anyone in particular?â€

â€œMy uncle Dougal, and Murtagh, him who was my godfather. Theyâ€™re the two Iâ€™d most want with me, in battle.â€ Jamie made a small restless movement. â€œIf I can, I make a wee moment to be alone before a fight. To wash, ken, and pray a bit, and then . . . to just ask if theyâ€™ll bide with me as I go.â€

Ian thought this interesting; he hadnâ€™t known either man himselfâ€”theyâ€™d both died at Cullodenâ€”but heâ€™d heard stories.

â€œBonnie fighters,â€ he said. â€œDid ye ask my da, too? To go with ye, I mean. Perhaps thatâ€™s why heâ€™s about.â€

Jamie turned his head sharply toward Ian, surprised. Then relaxed, shaking his head.

â€œI never had to ask Ian MÃ²r,â€ he said softly. â€œHe was always . . . just with me.â€ He gestured briefly to the darkness on his right.

Ianâ€™s eyes stung and his throat closed. But it was dark; it didnâ€™t matter.

He cleared his throat and held out one of the tiny dishes. â€œWill ye help me, Uncle Jamie?â€

â€œOh? Aye, surely. How dâ€™ye want it?â€

â€œRed across my foreheadâ€”I can do that bit. But black from the wee dots to the chin.â€ He drew a finger across the line of tattooed dots that curved under his cheekbones. â€œBlackâ€™s for strength, aye? It declares yeâ€™re a warrior. And yellow means yeâ€™re no afraid to die.â€

â€œOch, aye. Are ye wantinâ€™ the yellow today?â€

â€œNo.â€ He let the smile show in his voice, and Jamie laughed.

â€œMmphm.â€ Jamie dabbed with the rabbit-foot brush, then spread the color evenly with his thumb. Ian closed his eyes, feeling strength come into him with the touch.

â€œDo ye usually do this alone, Ian? Seems hard, save yeâ€™ve a looking glass.â€



â€œMostly. Or sometimes weâ€™d do it together, and a clan brother would paint ye. If itâ€™s an important thingâ€”a big raid, say, or going to make war on someoneâ€”then the medicine man would paint us, and sing.â€

â€œTell me ye dinna want me to sing, Ian,â€ his uncle murmured. â€œI mean, Iâ€™d try, but . . .â€

â€œIâ€™ll do without, thanks.â€

Black for the lower face, red on the forehead, and a band of the malachite green following the line of his tattoos, from ear to ear, across the bridge of his nose.

Ian peered at the small dishes of pigment; it was easy to spot the white, and he pointed to it.

â€œCan ye maybe draw a wee arrow, Uncle? Across my forehead.â€ He drew a finger from left to right, showing where.

â€œI can, aye.â€ Jamieâ€™s head was bent over the paint dishes, hand hovering. â€œDid ye not tell me once the white is for peace, though?â€

â€œAye, should ye be going to parley or trade, ye use a good deal of white. But itâ€™s for the mourning, tooâ€”so if ye go to avenge someone, yeâ€™d maybe wear white.â€

Jamieâ€™s head came up at that, staring at him.

â€œThis oneâ€™s no for vengeance,â€ Ian said. â€œItâ€™s for Flying Arrow. The dead man whose place I took, when I was adopted.â€ He spoke as casually as he could, but he felt his uncle tighten and look down. Neither one of them was ever going to forget that day of parting, when heâ€™d gone to the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka, and both of them had thought it was forever. He leaned over and put a hand on Jamieâ€™s arm.

â€œThat day, ye said to me, â€˜Cuimhnich,â€™ Uncle Jamie. And I did.â€ Remember.

â€œSo did I, Ian,â€ Jamie said softly, and drew the arrow on his forehead, his touch like a priestâ€™s on Ash Wednesday, marking Ian with the sign of the cross. â€œSo did we all. Is that it?â€

Ian touched the green stripe gingerly, to be sure it was dry enough.

â€œAye, I think so. Ken Brianna made me the paints? I was thinking of her, but then I thought I maybe shouldna take her with me that way.â€

He felt Jamieâ€™s breath on his skin as his uncle gave a small snort and then sat back.

â€œYe always carry your women wiâ€™ ye into battle, Ian Ã’g. Theyâ€™re the root of your strength, man.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ That made senseâ€”and was a relief to him. Still . . . â€œI was thinkinâ€™ it maybe wasna right to think of Rachel in such a place, though. Her being Quaker and all.â€

Jamie dipped his middle finger into the deer fat, then delicately into the white clay powder, and drew a wide, swooping â€œVâ€ near the crest of Ianâ€™s right shoulder. Even in the dark, it showed vividly.

â€œWhite dove,â€ he said with a nod. He sounded pleased. â€œThereâ€™s Rachel for ye.â€

He wiped his fingers on the rock, then rose and stretched. Ian saw him turn to look toward the east. It was still night, but the air had changed, just in the few minutes theyâ€™d sat. His uncleâ€™s tall figure was distinct against the sky, where a little before heâ€™d seemed part of the night.

â€œAn hour, nay more,â€ Jamie said. â€œEat first, aye?â€ And, with that, turned and walked away to the stream and his own interrupted prayers.





REACHING FOR THINGS THAT ARENâ€™T THERE

WILLIAM WISHED he could stop reaching for things that werenâ€™t there. A dozen times todayâ€”oftener!â€”heâ€™d reached for the dagger that should have been on his belt. Once or twice, for one of his pistols. Slapped an impotent hand against his hip, missing his sword, missing the small, solid weight of his shot pouch, the swing of his cartridge box.

And now he lay sweating naked on his cot, hand slapped flat on his chest where heâ€™d reached without thinking for the wooden rosary. The rosary that, if heâ€™d had it, would no longer be the comfort it had been for so many years. The rosary that, if heâ€™d had it, no longer said â€œMacâ€ to him. If he did still have it, heâ€™d have snatched it off and thrown it into the nearest fire. Thatâ€™s likely what James Fraser had done with it after William had thrown the rosary in the bastardâ€™s face. But, then, Fraser wasnâ€™t the bastard here, was he?

He muttered â€œScheisse!â€ and flung himself irritably over. Three feet away, Evans stirred and farted in his sleep, a sudden, muffled sound like distant cannon. On his other side, Merbling went on snoring.

Tomorrow. Heâ€™d gone to bed late after an exhausting day and would be up in an hour, maybe, but he lay wide awake, eyes so adapted to the dark that he could see the pale blur of the tent canvas overhead. No chance of sleep, he knew. Even if heâ€™d see no action himselfâ€”and he wouldnâ€™tâ€”the proximity of battle had him so keyed up that he could have leapt from bed and gone straight for the enemy right now, sword in hand.

Thereâ€™d be a battle. Maybe not a big one, but the Rebels were yapping at their heels, and tomorrowâ€”todayâ€”there would be a meeting. It might put paid to Washingtonâ€™s ambitions, though Sir Henry was firm that this was not his goal. He meant to get his army and the people under its protection to New York; that was all that matteredâ€”though if his officers should choose to demonstrate their military superiority while doing so, he had no great objection.

William had stood at attention behind Sir Henryâ€™s chair at dinner, his back against the tent wall, listening attentively while the plans were drawn up. Had in fact had the honor of carrying the formal written orders to von Knyphausen, whose troops were to march to Middletown, while Clintonâ€™s brigade would form up at the rear, to engage the Rebels while my lord Cornwallisâ€™s escorted the baggage train on to safety. Thatâ€™s why heâ€™d been so late getting to bed.

He yawned suddenly, surprising himself, and settled back, blinking. Maybe he could sleep a bit, after all. Thinking of dinner and orders and such mundanities as the color of von Knyphausenâ€™s nightshirtâ€”it was pink silk, with purple pansies embroidered round the neckâ€”rather than the oncoming battle had calmed his mind amazingly. Distraction. Thatâ€™s what he needed.

Worth a try, he supposed. . . . He squirmed into the most comfortable attitude he could manage, closed his eyes, and began mentally extracting the square roots of numbers greater than one hundred.

Heâ€™d got to the square root of 117 and was muzzily groping for the product of 12 and 6 when he felt the sudden stir of air on his damp skin. He sighed and opened his eyes, thinking that Merbling had got up for a piss, but it wasnâ€™t Merbling. A dark figure stood just inside the tent flap. The flap wasnâ€™t closed, and the figure was clearly visible against the faint glow from the banked campfires outside. A girl.

He sat up fast, groping one-handed for the shirt heâ€™d tossed to the foot of his cot.

â€œWhat the devil are you doing here?â€ he whispered, as softly as he could.

Sheâ€™d been hovering, uncertain. But hearing him speak, she came straight for him, and next thing he knew, her hands were on his shoulders, her hair brushing his face. He put up his own hands in reflex and found that she was in her shift, her breasts free and warm under it, a few inches from his face.

She pulled back, and in what seemed like the same motion, skimmed the shift off over her head, shook out her hair, and straddled him, her moist round thighs pressing his.

â€œGet off!â€ He grabbed her by the arms, pushing her away. Merbling stopped snoring. Evansâ€™s bedclothes rustled.

William stood up, snatched up her shift and his shirt, and, taking her by the arm, marched her out of the tent, as quietly as he could.

â€œWhat the devil do you think youâ€™re doing? Here, put that on!â€ He thrust the shift unceremoniously into her arms and hastily pulled his shirt on. They were not in full view of anyone, but might be at any moment.

Her head emerged from the shift like a flower popping out of a snowbank. A rather angry flower.

â€œWell, what do you think I was doing?â€ she said. She pulled her hair free of the shift and fluffed it violently. â€œI was trying to do you a kindness!â€

â€œAâ€”what?â€

â€œYouâ€™re going to fight tomorrow, arenâ€™t you?â€ There was enough light to see the shine of her eyes as she glared at him. â€œSoldiers always want to fuck before a fight! They need it.â€



He rubbed a hand hard over his face, palm rasping on his sprouting whiskers, then took a deep breath.

â€œI see. Yes. Very kind of you.â€ He suddenly wanted to laugh. He alsoâ€”very suddenlyâ€”wanted to take advantage of her offer. But not enough to do it with Merbling on one side and Evans on the other, ears flapping.

â€œIâ€™m not going to fight tomorrow,â€ he said, and the pang it caused him to say that out loud startled him.

â€œYouâ€™re not? Why not?â€ She sounded startled, too, and more than a little disapproving.

â€œItâ€™s a long story,â€ he said, struggling for patience. â€œAnd itâ€™s not your business. Now, look. I appreciate the thought, but I told you: youâ€™re not a whore, at least not for the time being. And youâ€™re not my whore.â€ Though his imagination was busy with images of what might have happened had she stolen into his cot and taken hold of him before he was fully awake . . . He put the thought firmly aside and, taking her by the shoulders, turned her round.

â€œGo back to your own bed now,â€ he said, but couldnâ€™t stop himself from patting her very nice arse in farewell. She turned her head and glared at him over her shoulder.

â€œCoward!â€ she said. â€œA man that wonâ€™t fuck wonâ€™t fight.â€

â€œWhat?â€ For an instant, he didnâ€™t think sheâ€™d really said it, but she had.

â€œYou heard me. Goodâ€”fuckingâ€”night!â€

He reached her in two strides, seized her shoulder, and whirled her round to face him.

â€œAnd who gave you that bit of wisdom, may I ask? Your good friend Captain Harkness?â€ He wasnâ€™t truly angry, but the shock of her unexpected arrival was still reverberating in his blood and he was annoyed. â€œDid I save you from buggery so you could throw my circumstances in my face?â€

Her chin drew back, and she breathed hard, but not in apparent distress.

â€œWhat circumstances?â€ she demanded.

â€œI told youâ€”bloody hell. Do you know what the Convention army is?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œWell, thatâ€™s the long story, and Iâ€™m not telling you it standing in my shirt in the middle of camp. Now, bugger off and take care of your sister and the lads. Thatâ€™s your job; Iâ€™ll take care of myself.â€

She exhaled sharply, with a puh! sound.

â€œDoubtless you will,â€ she said, with the maximum of sarcasm and a pointed glance at his cock, which was poking absurdly at his shirt, making its own urgent preferences known.

â€œScheisse,â€ he said again, briefly, then grabbed her in a bear hug that pressed her body against his all the way down and kissed her. She struggled, but after the first moment he realized that the struggle was not meant to procure her release but to provoke him further. He tightened his grip until she stopped, but didnâ€™t quit kissing her for some time thereafter.

He finally let go, panting and bedewed with perspiration; the air was like breathing hot tar. She was panting, too. He could take her. Wanted to. Push her down on her knees in the grass beside the tent, pull up her shift, and have her from behindâ€”it wouldnâ€™t take more than seconds.



â€œNo,â€ he said, and wiped his mouth on the back of his hand. â€œNo,â€ he said again, more positively. Every nerve in his body wanted her, and had he been sixteen, it would have been long over by this time. But he wasnâ€™t, and he had just enough self-control to turn her round again. He gripped her by scruff and buttock to keep her from turning back and held her immobile.

â€œWhen we get to New York,â€ he whispered, bending to speak in her ear, â€œIâ€™ll think again.â€

She stiffened, her buttock rounding hard in his hand, but didnâ€™t pull away or try to bite him, which heâ€™d half-expected.

â€œWhy?â€ she said, in a calm voice.

â€œThatâ€™s a long story, too,â€ he said. â€œGood night, Jane.â€ And, releasing her, stalked away into the dark. Nearby, the drums of reveille began.





PART FOUR



Day of Battle





GO OUT IN DARKNESS

IAN HAD BEEN OVER the land briefly the day before, scouting. â€œAnd a good thing, too,â€ he said, under his breath. It was the dark of the moon, and he must go canny and keep the road. He wasnâ€™t risking his horseâ€™s legs over the rough land before he had to, and Bride grant him the sky would be fully light by then.

Still, he was glad of the dark, and the solitude. Not that the land was still; the woods lived at night, and many things came out in the strange dawn hour when the light began to swell. But neither the rustle of hares and voles nor the sleepy call of waking birds demanded his notice or took any notice of him. He had finished his own prayers after Uncle Jamie left him, then departed alone in silence, and the peace of his preparations was still on him.

When he had lived with the Mohawkâ€”particularly when things had gone wrong with Emilyâ€”he would leave the longhouse for days, hunting alone with Rollo, until the wilderness had eased his spirit enough to go back, strengthened. He glanced down by reflex, but Rollo had been left behind with Rachel. The wound from the deadfall trap was clean; Auntie Claire had put something on it that helpedâ€”but he wouldnâ€™t have let Rollo come to a battle like this one offered to be, even had he been whole and a good deal younger than he was.

There was no doubt of the coming battle. He could smell it. His body was rising toward the fight; he could feel the tingling of itâ€”but he treasured this momentary stillness the more for that.

â€œWonâ€™t last long, mind,â€ he said softly to the horse, who ignored him. He touched the white dove on his shoulder and rode on, still quiet but not alone.



THE MEN HAD lain on their arms all night, by Sir Henryâ€™s orders. While one didnâ€™t actually lie on a musket and cartridge box, there was something about sleeping with a gun touching your body that kept you alert, ready to rouse from sleep in nothing flat.

William had no arms to lie on, and hadnâ€™t needed rousing, as he hadnâ€™t slept, but was no less alert for the lack. He wouldnâ€™t be fighting, and deeply regretted thatâ€”but he would be out in it, by God.

The camp was a-bustle, drums rattling up and down the aisles of tents, summoning the soldiers, and the air was full of the smells of baking bread, pork, and hot pease porridge.



There was no visible sign of dawn yet, but he could feel the sun there, just below the horizon, rising with the slow inevitability of its daily dominion. The thought reminded him, vividly, of the whale he had seen on the voyage to America: a dark shadow below the shipâ€™s side, easily dismissed as the change of light on the wavesâ€”and then, slowly, the growing bulk, the realization and the breathless wonder of seeing it rise, so close, so hugeâ€”and suddenly there.

He fastened his garters and tugged them tight before buckling his knee bands and pulling on his Hessian boots. At least he had his gorget back, to lend a touch of ceremony to the mundane task of getting dressed. The gorget, of course, reminded him of Janeâ€”was he ever going to be able to wear it without thinking of the damned girl?â€”and of recent events.

Heâ€™d regretted not accepting her offer, and still did. He could still smell her scent, musky and soft, like putting his face in thick fur. Her remark still rankled, too, and he snorted, settling his coat on his shoulders. Perhaps heâ€™d think again before they reached New York.

These idle thoughts were interrupted by the appearance of another of Sir Henryâ€™s aides, Captain Crosbie, who popped his head through the tent flap, clearly in a great flurry.

â€œOh, there you are, Ellesmere. Hoped Iâ€™d catch youâ€”here.â€ He tossed a folded note in Williamâ€™s general direction and vanished.

William snorted again and picked it up off the ground. Evans and Merbling had both left, they having actual troops to inspect and command; he envied them bitterly.

It was from General Sir Henry Clinton, and hit him in the stomach like a blow: . . . in view of your peculiar status, I think it best that you remain with the clerical staff today . . .

â€œStercus!â€ he said, finding German insufficient to his feelings. â€œExcrementum obscaenum! Filius mulieris prostabilis!â€

His chest was tight, blood was pounding in his ears, and he wanted to hit something. It would be useless to appeal to Sir Henry, he knew that much. But to spend the day essentially kicking his heels in the clerksâ€™ tentâ€”for what was there for him to do, if he wasnâ€™t allowed to carry dispatches or even do the lowly but necessary work of shepherding the camp followers and Loyalists? Whatâ€”was he to fetch the clerksâ€™ dinner in, or hold a torch in each hand when it got dark, like a fucking candelabra?

He was about to crumple the note into a wad, when yet another unwelcome head intruded itself, followed by an elegant body: Captain AndrÃ©, dressed for battle, sword at his side and pistols in his belt. William eyed him with dislike, though in fact he was an amiable fellow.

â€œOh, there you are, Ellesmere,â€ AndrÃ© said, pleased. â€œHoped you hadnâ€™t gone off yet. I need you to run me a dispatch, quickly. To Colonel Tarletonâ€”with the British Legion, the new Provincials, green chapsâ€”you know him?â€

â€œI do, yes.â€ William accepted the sealed dispatch, feeling odd. â€œCertainly, Captain.â€

â€œGood man.â€ AndrÃ© smiled and squeezed his shoulder, then strode out, ebullient with the promise of imminent action.

William drew a deep breath, carefully folded Sir Henryâ€™s note back into its original shape, and placed it on his cot. Who was to say that he hadnâ€™t met AndrÃ© first and, owing to the urgency of his request, left immediately, without reading Sir Henryâ€™s note?

He doubted heâ€™d be missed, in any case.





SPARROW-FART

IT WAS PERHAPS four oâ€™clock ack emma. Or before sparrow-fart, as the British armed forces of my own time used to put it. That sense of temporal dislocation was back again, memories of another war coming like a sudden fog between me and my work, then disappearing in an instant, leaving the present sharp and vivid as Kodachrome. The army was moving.

No fog obscured Jamie. He was big and solid, his outlines clearly visible against the shredding night. I was awake and alert, dressed and ready, but the chill of sleep still lay upon me, making my fingers clumsy. I could feel his warmth and drew close to him, as I might to a campfire. He was leading Clarence, who was even warmer, though much less alert, ears sagging in sleepy annoyance.

â€œYouâ€™ll have Clarence,â€ Jamie told me, putting the muleâ€™s reins in my hand. â€œAnd these, to make sure ye keep him, if ye should find yourself on your own.â€ â€œTheseâ€ were a heavy pair of horse pistols, holstered and strung on a thick leather belt that also held a shot bag and powder horn.

â€œThank you,â€ I said, swallowing as I wrapped the reins around a sapling in order to belt the pistols on. The guns were amazingly heavyâ€”but I wouldnâ€™t deny that the weight of them on my hips was amazingly comforting, too.

â€œAll right,â€ I said, glancing toward the tent where John was. â€œWhat aboutâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™ve seen to that,â€ he said, cutting me off. â€œGather the rest of your things, Sassenach; Iâ€™ve nay more than a quarter hour, at most, and I need ye with me when we go.â€

I watched him stride off into the mÃªlÃ©e, tall and resolute, and wonderedâ€”as I had so often beforeâ€”Will it be today? Will this be the last sight I remember of him? I stood very still, watching as hard as I could.

When Iâ€™d lost him the first time, before Culloden, Iâ€™d remembered. Every moment of our last night together. Tiny things would come back to me through the years: the taste of salt on his temple and the curve of his skull as I cupped his head; the soft fine hair at the base of his neck, thick and damp in my fingers . . . the sudden, magical well of his blood in dawning light when Iâ€™d cut his hand and marked him forever as my own. Those things had kept him by me.

And when Iâ€™d lost him this time, to the sea, Iâ€™d remembered the sense of him beside me, warm and solid in my bed, and the rhythm of his breathing. The light across the bones of his face in moonlight and the flush of his skin in the rising sun. I could hear him breathe when I lay in bed alone in my room at Chestnut Streetâ€”slow, regular, never stoppingâ€”even though I knew it had stopped. The sound would comfort me, then drive me mad with the knowledge of loss, so I pulled the pillow hard over my head in a futile attempt to shut it outâ€”only to emerge into the night of the room, thick with woodsmoke and candle wax and vanished light, and be comforted to hear it once more.

If this timeâ€”but he had turned, quite suddenly, as though Iâ€™d called his name. He came swiftly up to me, grasped me by the arms, and said in a low, strong voice, â€œIt willna be today, either.â€

Then he put his arms around me and drew me up on tiptoe into a deep, soft kiss. I heard brief cheers from a few of the men nearby, but it didnâ€™t matter. Even if it should be today, I would remember.



JAMIE STRODE toward his waiting companies, loosely assembled near the river. The breath of the water and the mist rising from it comforted him, keeping him wrapped for a little while longer in the peace of the night and the deep sense of his kin, there at his shoulder. Heâ€™d told Ian MÃ²r to stay with Ian Ã’g, as was right, but had the odd sense that there were three men with him, still.

Heâ€™d need the strength of his dead. Three hundred men, and heâ€™d known them for only days. Always before, when heâ€™d taken men into battle, they were men of his blood, of his clan, men who knew him, trusted himâ€”as he knew and trusted them. These men were strangers to him, and yet their lives were in his hands.

He wasnâ€™t worried by their lack of training; they were rough and undisciplined, a mere rabble by contrast with the Continental regulars whoâ€™d drilled all winter under von Steubenâ€”the thought of the little barrel-shaped Prussian made him smileâ€”but his troops had always been this kind of men: farmers and hunters, pulled from their daily occupations, armed with scythes and hoes as often as with muskets or swords. Theyâ€™d fight like fiends for himâ€”with himâ€”if they trusted him.

â€œHow is it, then, Reverend?â€ he said softly to the minister, who had just blessed his flock of volunteers and was hunched among them in his black coat, arms still half spread like a scarecrow protecting his misty field at dawn. The manâ€™s face, always rather stern in aspect, lightened upon seeing him, and he realized that the sky itself had begun to glow.

â€œAll well, sir,â€ Woodsworth said gruffly. â€œWe are ready.â€ He didnâ€™t, thank God, mention Bertram Armstrong.



â€œGood,â€ said Jamie, smiling from face to face, and seeing them all lighten in turn as the dawn touched them. â€œMr. Whelan, Mr. Maddox, Mr. Hebdenâ€”yeâ€™re all well in yourselves this morning, I hope?â€

â€œWe are,â€ they murmured, looking shyly gratified that he knew their names. He wished he knew them all, but had had to do the best he could, learning the names and faces of a handful of men in each company. It might give them the illusion that he did know every man by nameâ€”he hoped so; they needed to know he cared for them.

â€œReady, sir.â€ It was Captain Craddock, one of his three captains, stiff and self-conscious with the importance of the occasion, and Judah Bixby and Lewis Orden, two of Jamieâ€™s lieutenants, behind him. Bixby was no more than twenty, Orden maybe a year older; they could barely repress their excitement, and he smiled at them, feeling their joy in their young manhood echo in his own blood.

There were some very young men among the militia, he noticed. A couple of half-grown boys, tall and spindly as cornstalksâ€”who were they? Oh, yes, Craddockâ€™s sons. He remembered now; their mother had died only a month ago, and so they had come with their father into the militia.

God, let me bring them back safe! he prayed.

And feltâ€”actually feltâ€”a hand rest briefly on his shoulder, and knew who the third man was who walked with him.

Taing, Da, he thought, and blinked, raising his face so the tears in his eyes might be thought due to the brightness of the growing light.



I TIED CLARENCE to a picquet and made my way back into the tent, less troubled, though still keyed up. Whatever was going to happen was going to happen fast, and likely with little warning. Fergus and Germain had gone to find breakfast; I hoped they would show up before I had to leaveâ€”because when the time came, I would have to leave, no matter my reservations about abandoning a patient. Any patient.

This particular patient was lying on his back, under the lantern, his working eye half closed, singing to himself in German. He desisted when I came in, and turned his head to see who it was, blinking at sight of my armament.

â€œAre we expecting imminent invasion and capture?â€ he asked, sitting up.

â€œLie back down. No, this is Jamie being provident.â€ I touched one of the pistols gingerly. â€œI donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re loaded yet.â€

â€œCertainly they are. The man is nothing if not thorough.â€ He eased himself back down, groaning slightly.

â€œYou think you know him awfully well, donâ€™t you?â€ I asked, with an edge that rather surprised me.

â€œYes, I do,â€ he answered promptly. He smiled slightly at my expression. â€œNot nearly as well as you do in some matters, Iâ€™m sureâ€”but perhaps better in others. We are both soldiers.â€ He tilted his head, indicating the military racket going on outside.

â€œIf you know him that well,â€ I said, nettled, â€œyou should have known better than to say whatever you did say to him.â€



â€œAh.â€ The smile disappeared and he looked up at the canvas overhead in contemplation. â€œI did. Know better. I just said it anyway.â€

â€œAh,â€ I replied, and sat down next to the pile of bags and supplies that had made it thus far. Much of this would have to be abandoned. I could take a good deal in Clarenceâ€™s packs and saddlebags, but not everything. The army had been instructed to abandon almost everything they carried, save weapons and canteens, in the interests of speed.

â€œDid he tell you what it was?â€ John asked after a moment, his voice elaborately casual.

â€œWhat you said? No, but I could very likely guess.â€ I compressed my lips and didnâ€™t look at him, instead lining up bottles on top of a chest. Iâ€™d got salt from the innkeeperâ€”not without troubleâ€”and had made up a couple of bottles of crude saline solution, and there was the alcohol . . . I picked up the candle and began to dribble wax carefully over the corks, lest they loosen and the bottles discharge their contents along the way.

I didnâ€™t want to pursue the history of Johnâ€™s eye any further. Other considerations aside, any discussion might lead a little too close to Wentworth Prison for comfort. However close a friend Jamie might have considered John during the last few years, I was positive that heâ€™d never told John about Black Jack Randall and what had happened at Wentworth. Heâ€™d told his brother-in-law Ian, many years agoâ€”and therefore Jenny must know, too, though I doubted sheâ€™d ever spoken of it to Jamieâ€”but no one else.

John would likely assume that Jamie had hit him purely from revulsion at something overtly sexual from Johnâ€”or from jealousy over me. It was perhaps not quite fair to let him think thatâ€”but fairness didnâ€™t come into it.

Still, I regretted the trouble between them. Beyond whatever personal awkwardness I found in the present situation, I knew how much Johnâ€™s friendship had meant to Jamieâ€”and vice versa. And while I was more than relieved not to be married to John anymore, I did care for him.

Andâ€”while the noise and movement all around urged me to forget everything else but the urgency of departureâ€”I couldnâ€™t forget that this might be the last time I ever saw John, too.

I sighed and began to wrap the waxed bottles in towels. I should add whatever I could find room for from my Kingsessing haul, but . . .

â€œDonâ€™t be troubled, my dear,â€ John said gently. â€œYou know it will all come rightâ€”provided that we all live long enough.â€

I gave him a marked look and nodded toward the tent flap, where the clatter and clash of a military camp on the verge of movement was escalating.

â€œWell, youâ€™ll likely survive,â€ I said. â€œUnless you say the wrong thing to Jamie before we leave and he really does break your neck this time.â€

He glancedâ€”as briefly as possibleâ€”toward the pale shaft of dust-filled light, and grimaced.

â€œYouâ€™ve never had to do it, have you?â€ I said, seeing his face. â€œSit and wait through a battle, wondering if someone you care for will come back.â€

â€œNot with regard to anyone other than myself, no,â€ he replied, but I could see that the remark had gone home. He hadnâ€™t thought of that, and he didnâ€™t like the thought one bit. Welcome to the club, I thought sardonically.



â€œDo you think theyâ€™ll catch Clinton?â€ I asked, after a momentâ€™s silence. He shrugged, almost irritably.

â€œHow should I know? I havenâ€™t the slightest idea where Clintonâ€™s troops areâ€”I have no idea where Washington is, or where we are, for that matter.â€

â€œGeneral Washington would be about thirty yards that way,â€ I said, picking up a basket of bandages and lint, and nodding toward where Iâ€™d last seen the commander. â€œAnd I would be surprised if General Clinton is very much farther off.â€

â€œOh? And why is that, madam?â€ he asked, now half amused.

â€œBecause the order came down an hour ago to jettison all unnecessary suppliesâ€”though I donâ€™t know if he actually said â€˜jettison,â€™ come to think; that may not be a word in common use now. Thatâ€™s why we were inspecting the men, when we found youâ€”to leave back any who arenâ€™t capable of a long forced march on short rations, should that be necessary. Apparently it is.

â€œBut you know whatâ€™s happening,â€ I added, watching him. â€œI can hear it. You surely can.â€ Anyone with ears or eyes could sense the nervous excitement in camp, see the hasty preparations being made, the small fights and outbreaks of cursing as men got in each otherâ€™s way, the bawling of officers, only a hair short of eye-rolling, horn-tossing violence, the braying of mulesâ€”I hoped no one would steal Clarence before I got back to him.

John nodded, silent. I could see him turning the situation over in his mind, along with the obvious implications.

â€œYes, â€˜jettisonâ€™ is certainly a word in common use,â€ he said absently. â€œThough you hear it more in terms of sea cargo. Butâ€”â€ He jerked a little, realizing the further implications of what Iâ€™d said, and stared hard at me with his uncovered eye.

â€œDonâ€™t do that,â€ I said mildly. â€œYouâ€™ll hurt the other one. And what I am or am not isnâ€™t important just now, is it?â€

â€œNo,â€ he muttered, and shut the eye for a moment, then opened it, staring upward at the canvas overhead. Dawn was coming; the yellowed canvas was beginning to glow, and the air around us was thick with dust and the odor of dried sweat.

â€œI know very little that would be of interest to General Washington,â€ he said, â€œand I would be surprised if he didnâ€™t know that little already. I am not a serving officerâ€”or . . . well, I wasnâ€™t, until my bloody brother decided to reenter me on the rolls of his bloody regiment. Do you know, he nearly got me hanged?â€

â€œNo, but it sounds extremely like him,â€ I said, laughing despite my disquiet.

â€œWhat do youâ€”oh, God. Youâ€™ve met Hal?â€ Heâ€™d reared up on one elbow, blinking at me.

â€œI have,â€ I assured him. â€œLie down, and Iâ€™ll tell you.â€ Neither of us was going anywhere for a few minutes at least, and I was able to give him the entire story of my adventures with Hal in Philadelphia, while I wound up bandages, put my medical box in good order, and extracted what I thought the most important items from the supplies Iâ€™d brought. In an emergency, I might be reduced to what I could carry on my back at a dead run, and I made up a small rucksack with that contingency in mind, whilst regaling John with my opinions of his brother.

â€œJesus, if he thinks heâ€™s a chance in hell of preventing Dorothea from marrying Dr. Hunter . . . I believe Iâ€™d pay good money to overhear the conversation when he meets Denzell,â€ he remarked. â€œWho would you bet onâ€”given that Hal hasnâ€™t got a regiment at his back to enforce his opinions?â€

â€œHe likely has met him by now. As to oddsâ€”Denzell, three to two,â€ I said, after a momentâ€™s consideration. â€œHeâ€™s got not only God but loveâ€”and Dorotheaâ€”on his side, and I do think that will outweigh even Halâ€™s brand of . . . of . . . autocratic conviction?â€

â€œIâ€™d call it undiluted bastardliness, myself, but, then, Iâ€™m his brother. Iâ€™m allowed liberties.â€

The sound of voices speaking French announced the arrival of Fergus and Germain, and I stood up abruptly.

â€œI may notâ€”â€ I began, but he raised a hand, stopping me.

â€œIf not, then goodbye, my dear,â€ he said softly. â€œAnd good luck.â€





A SINGLE LOUSE

IT WAS BARELY AN hour past dawn and it would doubtless be another beastly hot day, but for the moment the air was still fresh and both William and Goth were happy. He threaded his way through the boiling mass of men, horses, limbers, and the other impedimenta of war, quietly whistling â€œThe King Enjoys His Own Again.â€

The baggage wagons were already being readied; a great dust cloud rose, roiling and shot through with gold from the rising sun, from the teamstersâ€™ park near von Knyphausenâ€™s division, encamped a quarter mile away, on the other side of Middletown. Theyâ€™d be off directly, heading for Sandy Hookâ€”and Jane, Fanny, Zeb, and Colenso with them, he sincerely hoped. A brief sensory recollection of the skin inside Janeâ€™s thighs sparked through his mind and he stopped whistling for an instant, but then shook it out of his head. Work to be done!

No one quite knew where the new British Legion was, though it was assumed to be somewhere in the vicinity of Clintonâ€™s division, it being one of his personal regiments, raised only a month ago in New York. That might be chancy, but William was quite willing to wager that he could evade Sir Henryâ€™s notice, under the conditions.

â€œLike picking one louse out of a Frenchieâ€™s wig,â€ he murmured, and patted Gothâ€™s neck. The horse was fresh and frisky, couldnâ€™t wait to reach the open road and break into a gallop. Clintonâ€™s division was holding the rear guard at Middletownâ€”enough distance to take the edge off Gothâ€™s bounciness. First, though, theyâ€™d have to get through the spreading mass of camp followers, struggling out of sleep into a desperate haste. He kept Goth on a short rein, lest he trample a childâ€”there were dozens of the little buggers, swarming over the ground like locusts.

Glancing up from the ground, he caught sight of a familiar form, standing in line for bread, and his heart gave a small leap of pleasure. Anne Endicott, dressed for day but without her cap, dark hair in a thick plait down her back. The sight of it gave him a frisson of intimacy, and he barely stopped himself calling out to her. Time enough, after the fight.





FOLIE Ã€ TROIS

FERGUS HAD BROUGHT me a sausage roll and a cannikin of coffeeâ€”real coffee, for a wonder.

â€œMilord will send for you shortly,â€ he said, handing these over.

â€œIs he nearly ready?â€ The food was warm and freshâ€”and I knew it might be the last I got for some timeâ€”but I barely tasted it. â€œHave I time to dress Lord Johnâ€™s eye again?â€ The pervading air of haste was clearly perceptible to me, and my skin had started twitching as though I were being attacked by ants.

â€œI will go and see, milady. Germain?â€ Fergus tilted his head toward the tent flap, beckoning Germain to go with him.

But Germain, out of what might have been either loyalty to John or fear of finding himself alone with Jamieâ€”who had rather plainly meant what he said regarding the future of Germainâ€™s arseâ€”wanted to stay in the tent.

â€œIâ€™ll be fine,â€ John assured him. â€œGo with your father.â€ He was still pale and sweating, but his jaw and hands had relaxed; he wasnâ€™t in severe pain.

â€œYes, he will be fine,â€ I said to Germain, but nodded to Fergus, who went out without further comment. â€œFetch me some fresh lint, will you? Then you can come and help me while his lordship rests. As for youâ€”â€ I turned to John. â€œYou lie flat, keep your eye closed, and bloody stay out of trouble, if such a thing is possible.â€

He swiveled his good eye in my direction, wincing slightly as the movement pulled on the bad one.



â€œAre you accusing me of causing the imbroglio that resulted in my injury, madam? Because I distinctly recall your playing some minor role in its origins.â€ He sounded rather cross.

â€œI had nothing whatever to do with your ending up here,â€ I said firmly, though I could feel my cheeks flush. â€œGermain, have you found the lint?â€

â€œWill the honey not draw flies, Grannie?â€ Germain handed me the requested lint but stood by the cot, frowning down at its occupant. â€œKen what they say, aye? Ye catch more flies wiâ€™ honey than ye do wiâ€™ vinegar. Ye couldna pour vinegar on him, I suppose?â€

â€œHmmm.â€ He had a point. We were no great distance from the teamsters; I could hear mules snorting and braying, and newly wakened flies, still heavy with sleep, had been buzzing round my ears even as I unwrapped the old bandage. â€œRight. Not vinegar, but mint might help. Find the tin with the fleur-de-lis, then, and rub ointment on his lordshipâ€™s face and handsâ€”donâ€™t get it in his eyes. Then bring the small boxâ€”â€

â€œI am certainly capable of rubbing ointment on myself,â€ John interrupted, and extended a hand to Germain. â€œHere, give it to me.â€

â€œLie still,â€ I said, rather cross myself. â€œAs for what youâ€™re capable of, I shudder to think.â€ I had set a small dish of honey to warm near the lantern; I filled my syringe and injected the honey around his bad eye, made a small pad of lint, thumbed it gently into his eye socket, and bound a clean length of gauze round his head to hold it in place, thinking as I did so.

â€œGermain . . . go and fill the canteen, will you?â€ It was half full already, but he obligingly took it and went, leaving me alone with John.

â€œShall I leave Germain with you?â€ I asked, stuffing the last few items into my first-aid kit. â€œAnd Fergus?â€ I added hesitantly.

â€œNo,â€ he said, slightly startled. â€œWhat for?â€

â€œWell . . . protection. In case Monsieur Beauchamp should come back, I mean.â€ I didnâ€™t trust Percy in the slightest. I was also dubious about putting Fergus in close proximity to him, but it had occurred to me that perhaps John might be some protection to him.

â€œAh.â€ He closed his good eye for a moment, then opened it again. â€œNow, that imbroglio is indeed of my own making,â€ he said ruefully. â€œBut while Germain is admittedly a formidable presence, I shanâ€™t need a bodyguard. I rather doubt that Percy intends either to assault or to kidnap me.â€

â€œDo you . . . care for him?â€ I asked curiously.

â€œIs it your business if I do?â€ he replied evenly.

I flushed more deeply, but took a few breaths before answering.

â€œYes,â€ I said at last. â€œYes, I rather think it is. Whatever my role in the origins of this . . . this . . . er . . .â€

â€œFolie Ã  trois?â€ he suggested, and I laughed. Iâ€™d told him what a folie Ã  deux was, with reference to Mrs. Figgâ€™s and the laundressâ€™s shared obsession with starched drawers.

â€œThat will do. But, yes, it is my businessâ€”on Jamieâ€™s behalf, if not yours.â€ But it was on his behalf, as well. The shock and rush of recent events had prevented my thinking through the situation, but I was quite sure that Jamie had. And now that I was thoroughly awake and undistracted by my own affairs, my thoughts were catching up with uncomfortable rapidity.



â€œDo you recall a Captain AndrÃ©?â€ I asked abruptly. â€œJohn AndrÃ©. He was at the Mischianza.â€

â€œI may have lost a few things over the course of the last few days,â€ he said, with some acerbity, â€œbut neither my memory nor my wits. Yet,â€ he added, in a marked manner. â€œOf course I know him. A very sociable and artistic young man; he was invited everywhere in Philadelphia. Heâ€™s on General Clintonâ€™s staff.â€

â€œDid you know that heâ€™s also a spy?â€ My heart was thumping in my ears, and my stays felt suddenly too tight. Was I about to do something hideously irrevocable?

He blinked, obviously startled.

â€œNo. Why on earth should you think that?â€ And, a half second later, â€œAnd why the devil would you tell me about it, if you do think so?â€

â€œBecause,â€ I said, as evenly as I could, â€œheâ€™ll be caught doing it, in another year or two. Heâ€™ll be found behind the American lines, in civilian clothes, with incriminating documents on his person. And the Americans will hang him.â€

The words hung in the air between us, visible as though they were written in black smoke. John opened his mouth, then shut it again, clearly nonplussed.

I could hear all the sounds of the camp around us: talk, occasional shouting, and the sounds of horses and mules, the beat of a drum in the distance, summoning men to . . . what? Someone at close range practicing a fife, the shrill note breaking in the same place each time. The constant rumble and shriek of the grinding wheel, frenziedly sharpening metal for the last time. And the increasing buzz of flies.

They were drifting into the tent in small clouds of carnivory; two of them landed on Johnâ€™s forehead, to be irritably brushed away. The tin of bug repellent lay on the cot where Germain had put it down; I reached for it.

â€œNo,â€ he said, rather sharply, and took it from my hand. â€œI canâ€”Iâ€”donâ€™t touch me, if you please.â€ His hand trembled, and he had a momentâ€™s difficulty in getting the lid off, but I didnâ€™t help him. Iâ€™d gone cold to the fingertips, in spite of the stifling atmosphere in the tent.

Heâ€™d surrendered to Jamie personally, given his parole. It would be Jamie who would eventually have to hand him over to General Washington. Would have to; too many people had seen the incident, knew where John wasâ€”and, by this time, what he was.

John didnâ€™t sit up, but managed to thumb a glob of the mentholated grease from the tin and rub it on his face and neck.

â€œYou didnâ€™t have anything in your clothes,â€ I ventured, with a faint hope. â€œNo incriminating documents, I mean.â€

â€œI had my warrant of commission in my pocket when the Rebel militia took me, outside Philadelphia,â€ he said, but spoke in an abstract tone, as though it didnâ€™t really matter. He rubbed ointment briskly over his hands and wrists. â€œNot proof of spying in itselfâ€”but certainly proof that I was a British officer, out of uniform and arguably behind the American lines at the time. Donâ€™t talk anymore, my dear; itâ€™s very dangerous.â€

He snapped the lid onto the tin and held it out to me.



â€œYouâ€™d better go,â€ he said, looking me in the eye and speaking in a low voice. â€œYou must not be found alone with me.â€

â€œGrannie?â€ Germain pushed back the tent flap, red as a beet under his shaggy bangs. â€œGrannie! Come quick! Papa says Grand-pÃ¨re wants you!â€

He disappeared and I hastily snatched up my equipment, bedizening myself with bags and boxes. I made for the tent flap, but paused for an instant, turning to John.

â€œI should have askedâ€”does he care for you?â€ I said.

He shut his good eye and his lips compressed for a moment.

â€œI hope not,â€ he said.



I HURRIED AFTER Germain with my medical satchel full of gurgling bottles slung over my shoulder, a small box of extra instruments and sutures under my arm, Clarenceâ€™s reins in hand, and a mind so agitated I could hardly see where I was going.

I realized now that I hadnâ€™t been telling John anything he didnâ€™t know. Well . . . bar the account of Captain AndrÃ©â€™s future fate, and while that was chilling enough, it wasnâ€™t of direct importance at the moment.

Heâ€™d stopped me speaking, because heâ€™d already known how much danger he stood inâ€”and what the effects were likely to be on Jamie, and on me. â€œYou must not be found alone with me.â€

Because Iâ€™d been at one point his wife, he meant. Thatâ€™s what heâ€™d been thinking but hadnâ€™t wanted to tell me, until I forced the issue.

If anything happenedâ€”well, be blunt about it: if he broke his parole and escapedâ€”Iâ€™d very likely be suspected of having a hand in it, but the suspicion would be a great deal more pronounced if anyone could testify to having seen us in private conversation. And Jamie would be suspected of complicity at worst, or, at best, of having a wife who was disloyal both to him and to the cause of independence. . . . I could easily end up in a military prison. So might Jamie.

But if John didnâ€™t escape . . . or escaped and was recaptured . . .

But the road lay before me, and Jamie was there on his horse, holding the reins of my mare. And it was Jamie with whom Iâ€™d cross the Rubicon todayâ€”not John.



THE MARQUIS de La Fayette was waiting for them at the rendezvous, face flushed and eyes bright with anticipation. Jamie couldnâ€™t help smiling at sight of the young Frenchman, got up regardless in a glorious uniform with red silk facings. He wasnâ€™t inexperienced, though, despite his youth and his very obvious Frenchness. Heâ€™d told Jamie about the battle at Brandywine Creek a year before, where heâ€™d been wounded in the leg, and how Washington had insisted that he lie beside him and wrapped him in his own cloak. Gilbert idolized Washington, who had no sons of his own, and who clearly felt a deep affection for the wee marquis.



Jamie glanced at Claire, to see if she was appreciating La Fayetteâ€™s stylish toilette, but her gaze was fixedâ€”with a small frownâ€”on a group of men in the far distance, beyond the Continental regulars drawn up in orderly formations. She wasnâ€™t wearing her spectacles; he could see easily at a distance and half-stood in his stirrups to look.

â€œGeneral Washington and Charles Lee,â€ he told her, sitting back in the saddle. La Fayette, spotting them, as well, swung himself into his own saddle and rode toward the senior officers. â€œI suppose Iâ€™d best go join them. Dâ€™ye see Denzell Hunter yet?â€ He had it in mind to confide Claire to Hunterâ€™s care; he didnâ€™t mean her to be wandering the battlefieldâ€”if there was oneâ€”on her own, no matter how helpful she might be there, and was wary of leaving her alone.

Hunter was driving his wagon, though, and that couldnâ€™t keep up with the marching men. Clouds of dust rose in the air, stirred by thousands of eager feet; it tickled in his chest, and he coughed.

â€œNo,â€ she said. â€œDonâ€™t worry.â€ And she smiled at him, brave, though her face was pale despite the heat, and he could feel the flutter of her fear in his own wame. â€œAre you all right?â€ She always looked at him in that searching way when he set out to a fight, as though committing his face to memory in case he was killed. He kent why she did it, but it made him feel strangeâ€”and he was already unsettled this morning.

â€œAye, fine,â€ he said, and taking her hand, kissed it. He should have spurred up and gone, but lingered for a moment, loath to let go.

â€œDid youâ€”â€ she began, and then stopped abruptly.

â€œPut on clean drawers? Aye, though itâ€™s like to be wasted effort, ken, when the guns start firinâ€™.â€ It was a feeble enough jest, but she laughed, and he felt better.

â€œDid I what?â€ he prompted, but she shook her head.

â€œNever mind. You donâ€™t need anything else to think of now. Justâ€”be careful, will you?â€ She swallowed visibly, and his heart turned over.

â€œI will,â€ he said, and took up the reins but looked back over his shoulder, in case Young Ian should be coming. She was safe enough, in the midst of the forming companies, but heâ€™d still be happier with someone to look after her. And if he told her that, sheâ€™d likelyâ€”

â€œThereâ€™s Ian!â€ she exclaimed, squinting to see. â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with his horse, I wonder?â€

He looked where she was looking and saw the cause at once. His nephew was afoot, leading the halting horse, and both of them were looking crankit.

â€œLame,â€ he said. â€œAnd badly lamed, too. Whatâ€™s amiss, Ian?â€ he called.

â€œStepped on summat sharp, coming up the bank, and cracked his hoof, right down into the quick.â€ Ian ran a hand down the horseâ€™s leg and the animal all but leaned on him, picking up its unshod hoof at once. Sure enough, the crack was visible, and deep enough to make Jamie wince in sympathy. Like having a toenail torn off, he supposed, and having to walk a distance with it.

â€œTake my horse, Ian,â€ Claire said, and slid off in a flurry of petticoats. â€œI can ride Clarence. No need for me to be fast, after all.â€

â€œAye, all right,â€ Jamie said, though a bit reluctant. Her mare was a good one, and Ian had to have a mount. â€œShift the saddles, then, and, Ian, watch out for Dr. Hunter. Dinna leave your auntie â€™til he comes, aye? Goodbye, Sassenach; Iâ€™ll see ye later in the day.â€ He could wait no longer, and nudged his horse away into the crowd.

Other officers had gathered around Washington; heâ€™d barely be in time. But it wasnâ€™t the risk of being conspicuously late that cramped his bowels. It was guilt.

He ought to have reported John Greyâ€™s arrest at once. He kent that fine, but had delayed, hoping . . . hoping what? That the ridiculous situation would somehow evaporate? If he had reported it, Washington would have had Grey taken into custody and locked up somewhereâ€”or hanged him out of hand, as an example. He didnâ€™t think that likely, but the possibility had been enough to keep him from saying anything, counting on the chaos of the impending exodus to keep anyone from noticing.

But what was eating at his insides now was not guilt over duty deferred, or even over exposing Claire to danger by keeping the wee sodomite in his own tent instead of turning him over. It was the fact that he had not thought to revoke Greyâ€™s parole this morning when he left. If he had, Grey might easily have escaped in the confusion of leaving, and even if there had been trouble later over it . . . John Grey would be safe.

But it was too late, and with a brief prayer for the soul of Lord John Grey, he reined up beside the Marquis de La Fayette and bowed to General Washington.





MORASSES AND IMBROGLIOS

THERE WERE THREE CREEKS running through the land, cutting it up. Where the earth was soft, the water had cut deep and the creek ran at the bottom of a steep ravine, the banks of it thick with saplings and underbrush. A farmer heâ€™d spoken to while scouting the day before had told him the names of themâ€”Dividing Brook, Spotswood Middle Brook, and Spotswood North Brookâ€”but Ian wasnâ€™t at all sure he kent for sure which this one was.

The ground here was wide and low; the creek ran out into a sunken, marshy sort of place, and he turned away; bad footing for either man or horse. One of the farmers had called the ravines â€œmorasses,â€ and he thought that a good word. He looked up the creek, searching for good watering places, but the ravine fell too steeply. A man could make shift to scramble down to the water, maybe, but not horses or mules.

Ian felt them before he saw them. The sense of a hunting animal, lying concealed in the wood, waiting for prey to come down to drink. He turned his horse sharply and rode along the creek bank, watching the trees on the other side.

Movement, a horseâ€™s head tossing against flies. A glimpse of a faceâ€”facesâ€”painted, like his own.

A thrill of alarm shot up his spine and instinct flattened him against the horseâ€™s neck, as the arrow whizzed over his head. It stuck, quivering, in a nearby sycamore.

He straightened, his own bow in hand, nocked an arrow in the same movement, and sent it back, aiming blind for the spot where heâ€™d seen them. The arrow shredded leaves as it went but struck nothingâ€”he hadnâ€™t expected it to.

â€œMohawk!â€ came a derisory shout from the other side, and a few words in a language he didnâ€™t understand but whose intended meaning was clear enough. He made a very Scottish gesture, whose meaning was also clear, and left them laughing.

He paused to yank the arrow out of the sycamore. Fletched with a yaffleâ€™s tail feathers, but not a pattern he knew. Whatever theyâ€™d been speaking wasnâ€™t an Algonquian tongue. Might be something northern like Assiniboineâ€”heâ€™d know, if he got a clear look at themâ€”but might equally be something from nearer to hand.

Very likely working for the British army, though. He kent most of the Indian scouts presently with the Rebels. And while they hadnâ€™t been trying to kill himâ€”they could have done so, easily, if theyâ€™d really wanted toâ€”this was rougher teasing than might be expected. Perhaps only because theyâ€™d recognized him for what he was.

Mohawk! To an English speaker, it was just easier to say than â€œKahnyenâ€™kehaka.â€ To any of the tribes who lived within knowledge of the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka, it was either a word to scare children with or a calculated insult. â€œMan-eater,â€ it meant, for the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka were known to roast their enemies alive and devour the flesh.

Ian had never seen such a thing, but he knew menâ€”old menâ€”who had and would tell you about it with pleasure. He didnâ€™t care to think about it. It brought back much too vividly the night the priest had died in Snaketown, mutilated and burned aliveâ€”the night that had inadvertently taken Ian from his family and made him a Mohawk.

The bridge lay upstream, perhaps sixty yards from where he was. He paused, but the woods on the other side were silent, and he ventured across, his horseâ€™s hooves a careful clopping on the boards. If there were British scouts here, the army was not too far beyond.

There were broad meadows past the woods on the far side, and beyond these the fields of a good-sized farm; he could see a snatch of the buildings through the treesâ€”and the movement of men. He turned hastily, circling a copse and coming out into ground open enough to see.

There were green-coated soldiers on the ridgeline beyond the farm buildings, and he could smell the sulfur of their slow match on the heavy air. Grenadiers.

He wheeled his horse and headed back, to find someone to tell.



WILLIAM FINALLY discovered the cavalry detachment of the British Legion, filling their canteens from a well in the yard of a farmhouse. They had a picket out, though, who gave a warning shout at sight of a lone horseman, and half the company swung round, on the alert. A well-trained company; Banastre Tarleton was a good, energetic officer.

Tarleton himself was standing relaxed in the shade of a big tree, his ornately plumed helmet cradled in one arm, mopping his face with a green silk kerchief. William rolled his eyes briefly at this bit of affectation, but not so Tarleton could see. He came to a walk and rode up beside Tarleton, leaning down to give him the dispatch.

â€œFrom Captain AndrÃ©,â€ he said. â€œBeen busy?â€ The men had been fighting; he could smell the smoke on them, and a couple of men with what looked like minor wounds were sitting against the barn, uniforms streaked with blood. The barn doors hung open on emptiness, and the yard was trampled and spotted with dung; he wondered for a moment whether the farmer had driven his own stock away, or whether one or another of the armies had taken the animals.

â€œNot nearly busy enough,â€ Tarleton replied, reading the note. â€œThis may help, though. Weâ€™re to go reinforce my lord Cornwallis.â€ His face was flushed with the heat, and his leather stock was clearly cutting into his thick, muscular neck, but he looked exceedingly cheerful at the prospect.

â€œGood,â€ said William, reining up to turn and go, but Tarleton stopped him with a raised hand. He tucked the dispatch away in his pocket, along with the green kerchief.

â€œSince I see you, Ellesmereâ€”saw a tasty piece last night in camp, in the bread line,â€ he said. Tarleton sucked his lower lip for an instant and released it, red and wet. â€œVery tasty, and a sweet little sister with her, too, though that oneâ€™s not quite ripe enough for me.â€ William raised his brows, but felt himself tense in thighs and shoulders.

â€œMade her an offer,â€ Tarleton said, overtly careless but with a swift glance at Williamâ€™s hands. William relaxed them with an effort. â€œShe declined, thoughâ€”said she was yours?â€ This last was not quite a question, but not quite not.

â€œIf her name is Jane,â€ William said shortly, â€œshe and her sister are traveling under my protection.â€

Tarletonâ€™s quizzical look flowered into open amusement.

â€œYour protection,â€ he repeated. His full lips twitched. â€œI believe she told me that her name was Arabella, thoughâ€”perhaps weâ€™re thinking of different girls.â€

â€œNo, weâ€™re not.â€ William did not want to be having this conversation, and gathered up his reins. â€œDonâ€™t fucking touch her.â€

That was a mistake; Tarleton never passed up a challenge. His eyes sparkled and William saw him set himself, legs spread.



â€œFight you for her,â€ he said.

â€œWhat, here? Are you insane?â€ There were bugles in the distance, and not a very far distance, either. To say nothing of Tarletonâ€™s troops, many of them clearly listening to this exchange.

â€œWouldnâ€™t take long,â€ Tarleton said softly, rocking back on his heels. His left fist was loosely curled and he rubbed his right hand flat on the side of his breeches, coat pushed back. He glanced over his shoulder, to the empty barn. â€œMy men wouldnâ€™t interfere, but we could go in there, if youâ€™re shy.â€ â€œShyâ€ said with that particular intonation that made it clear that cowardice was meant.

It had been on the tip of Williamâ€™s tongue to say, â€œI donâ€™t own the girlâ€â€”but to make that admission was to give Tarleton license to go after her. Heâ€™d seen Ban with girls often enough; he wasnâ€™t violent with them, but he was insistent. Never left without getting what he wanted, one way or another.

And after Harkness . . . His thoughts hadnâ€™t caught up with his body; he was on the ground, shucking his coat, before heâ€™d made a conscious decision.

Ban laid his helmet on the ground, grinning, and took off his own coat in a leisurely fashion. The motion attracted all his men at once, and in seconds they were surrounded by a circle of dragoons, whistling and hooting encouragement. The only dissenter was Banâ€™s lieutenant, who had gone a sickly shade of gray.

â€œColonel!â€ he said, and William realized that the manâ€™s fear had all to do with taking issue with Ban and not the consequences of what might happen if he didnâ€™t. He meant to do his duty, though, and reached out a hand to grip Tarletonâ€™s arm. â€œSir. Youâ€”â€

â€œLet go,â€ Ban said, not taking his eyes off William. â€œAnd shut up.â€ The lieutenantâ€™s hand dropped away as though someone had punched him in the shoulder.

William felt at once detached, as though he were watching this from somewhere outside himself, above it allâ€”and that part of him wanted to laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. And some very tiny remnant of conscience was appalled. But the fleshly part of him was grimly exultant, and very much in charge.

Heâ€™d seen Ban fight before, and didnâ€™t make the mistake of waiting for any sort of signal. The moment the green coat hit the ground, William launched himself andâ€”ignoring a ferocious hook that slammed into his ribsâ€”grabbed Tarleton by both shoulders, jerked him forward, and butted him in the face with a horrid sound of cracking bone.

He let go, pushed Ban hard in the chest, and sent him staggering backward, blood flying from his broken nose and a surprised look on his face that turned immediately to berserk fury. Tarleton dug in his heels and leapt at William like a rabid dog.

William had six inches and forty pounds on Ban, and three older cousins who had taught him to fight. Banastre Tarleton had an unshakable conviction that he was going to win any fight he started.

They were struggling on the ground, so locked that neither was actually able to hit the other effectively, when William dimly heard the lieutenantâ€™s voice, full of panic, and a rush all round them. Hands seized him and dragged him away from Tarleton; more hands pushed him frantically toward his horse. There were drums coming down the lane and the sound of marching feet.

He mounted in a daze, a taste of blood in his mouth, and spat by reflex. His coat was thrown across his lap, and someone slapped his horse with a sharp â€œTâ€™cha!â€ that nearly unseated William, whose feet were nowhere near the stirrups.

He pressed knees and calves into the horseâ€™s sides, urging Goth into a gallop, and burst from the lane directly in front of an infantry column, whose sergeant recoiled with a shout of alarm. Scots. He saw the checkered trews and caps, and heard a few uncouth shouts in what might be Scots or Gaelic, but didnâ€™t care. They belonged to a regiment he didnâ€™t knowâ€”and so their officers wouldnâ€™t know him.

Tarleton could give what explanations he liked. Williamâ€™s left ear was ringing, and he shook his head and pressed the flat of his hand against the ear to quiet it.

When he took the hand away, the ringing had eased, and a number of people were singing â€œYankee Doodleâ€ instead. He glanced over his shoulder, incredulous, and saw a number of blue-coated Continentals, dragging a number of cannon, making for the distant ridgeline.

Go back and tell the Scots infantry and Tarletonâ€™s men? Head south to Cornwallis?

â€œHey, redcoat!â€ A shout from his left made him look in that direction, and just in time. A group of ten or fifteen men in hunting shirts was bearing down on him, most of them armed with scythes and hoes. One man was aiming a musket at him; apparently he was the one who had shouted, for he did so again: â€œDrop your reins and get off!â€

â€œThe devil I will,â€ William replied, and booted Goth, who took off as though his tail were on fire. William heard the boom of the musket, but crouched low over the horseâ€™s neck and kept going.





PECULIAR BEHAVIOR OF A TENT

WHILE NOT EAGER to be removed to a prison of some sort, John Grey was beginning to wish at least for solitude. Fergus Fraser and his son had insisted on remaining with him until someone came for him. Presumably so they could tell Jamie how he had been disposed of.



He was peculiarly disinterested in the method and means of that disposal, content to await developments. What he wanted solitude for was a contemplation of Percy Wainwrightâ€™s presence, motives, and possible action. With La Fayette, heâ€™d said. Adviser. John shuddered to think what sort of advice might be given by that . . . and what about his interests in Fergus Fraser?

He glanced at said printer, presently engaged in argument with his precocious offspring.

â€œYou did it!â€ Germain glowered up at his father, face flushed red with righteous indignation. â€œYe told me so yourself, a dozen times or more! How you went to war with Grand-pÃ¨re, and stabbed a man in the leg, and rode on a cannon when the soldiers dragged it back from Prestonpansâ€”and ye werenâ€™t even as old as I am now when ye did all that!â€

Fergus paused for an instant, regarding his offspring through narrowed eyes, obviously regretting his previous prolixity. He breathed steadily through his nose for a moment, then nodded.

â€œThat was different,â€ he said evenly. â€œI was milordâ€™s employee at the time, not his son. I had a duty to attend him; he had no responsibility to prevent me doing so.â€

Germain blinked, frowning uncertainly.

â€œYou werenâ€™t his son?â€

â€œOf course not,â€ Fergus said, exasperated. â€œIf I told you about Prestonpans, surely I have told you that I was an orphan in Paris when I met your grand-pÃ¨re. He hired me to pick pockets for him.â€

â€œHe did?â€ John hadnâ€™t meant to interrupt, but couldnâ€™t help it. Fergus glanced at him, startled; evidently he hadnâ€™t really noticed Johnâ€™s presence, focused as he was on Germain. He bowed.

â€œHe did, my lord. We were Jacobites, you understand. He required information. Letters.â€

â€œOh, indeed,â€ John murmured, and took a sip from his flask. Then, recalling his manners, offered it to Fergus, who blinked in surprise, but then accepted it with another bow and took a healthy gulp. Well, it must be thirsty work, pursuing an errant child through an army. He thought briefly of Willie, and thanked God his son was safeâ€”or was he?

Heâ€™d known that William would of course have left Philadelphia when Clinton withdrew the armyâ€”perhaps as a non-fighting aide-de-camp to a senior officer. But he hadnâ€™t thought about that supposition in conjunction with the apparent present fact that General Washington was now in hot pursuit of Clinton and might just possibly catch up with him. In which case, William . . .

These thoughts had distracted him from the ongoing tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, and he was jerked out of them by a question directed to him by Germain.

â€œMe? Oh . . . sixteen. I might have gone to the army earlier,â€ John added apologetically, â€œhad my brotherâ€™s regiment been formed, but he only raised it during the Jacobite Rising.â€ He looked at Fergus with new interest. â€œYou were at Prestonpans, were you?â€ That should have been his own first battle, tooâ€”and would have been, save for his happening to meet one Red Jamie Fraser, notorious Jacobite, in a mountain pass two nights before.

â€œDid you kill anybody?â€ Germain demanded.



â€œNot at Prestonpans. Later, at Culloden. I wish I hadnâ€™t.â€ He stretched out a hand for the flask. It was nearly empty, and he drained it.

A moment later, he was glad of his celerity; had he not drained the flask already, he might have choked. The tent flap folded back, and Percy Wainwright/Beauchamp stuck his head in, then froze in surprise, dark eyes darting from one to another of the tentâ€™s inhabitants. John had an impulse to throw the empty flask at him, but thought better of it, instead saying coldly, â€œI beg your pardon, sir; I am engaged.â€

â€œSo I see.â€ Percy didnâ€™t look at John â€œMr. Fergus Fraser,â€ he said softly, coming into the tent, hand outstretched. â€œYour servant, sir. Comment Ã§a va?â€

Fergus, unable to avoid him, shook his hand with reserve and bowed slightly but said nothing. Germain made a small growling noise in his throat, but desisted when his father gave him a sharp glance.

â€œI am so pleased finally to have encountered you in private, Monsieur Fraser,â€ Percy said, still speaking French. He smiled as charmingly as possible. â€œMonsieurâ€”do you know who you are?â€

Fergus regarded him thoughtfully.

â€œFew men know themselves, monsieur,â€ he said. â€œFor my part, I am entirely content to leave such knowledge to God. He can deal with it far better than I could. And having come to this conclusion, I believe that is all I have to say to you. Pardonnez-moi.â€ With that, he shouldered past Percy, taking him off-guard and knocking him off-balance. Germain turned at the tent flap and stuck out his tongue.

â€œDamned frog!â€ he said, then disappeared with a small yelp as his father jerked him through the flap.

Percy had lost one of his silver-buckled shoes in trying to stay upright. He brushed dirt and vegetable matter from the bottom of his stocking and screwed his foot back into the shoe, lips compressed and a rather attractive flush showing across his cheekbones.

â€œOughtnâ€™t you to be with the army?â€ John inquired. â€œSurely you want to be there, if Washington does meet Clinton. I imagine your â€˜interestsâ€™ would want a full report by an eyewitness, wouldnâ€™t they?â€

â€œShut up, John,â€ Percy said briefly, â€œand listen. I havenâ€™t got much time.â€ He sat down on the stool with a thump, folded his hands on his knee, and looked intently at John, as though evaluating his intelligence. â€œDo you know a manâ€”a British officerâ€”called Richardson?â€



FERGUS MADE HIS way through the shambles left by the exodus of the army, holding Germain firmly by the hand. The camp followers and such men as had been left behind as unfit were setting to the work of salvage, and no one gave the Frasers more than a glance. He could only hope that the horse was where he had left it. He touched the pistol tucked under his shirt, just in case.

â€œFrog?â€ he said to Germain, not bothering to keep amusement out of his voice. â€œDamned frog, you said?â€



â€œWell, he is, Papa.â€ Germain stopped walking suddenly, pulling his hand free. â€œPapa, I need to go back.â€

â€œWhy? Have you forgotten something?â€ Fergus glanced over his shoulder at the tent, feeling an uneasiness between his shoulder blades. Beauchamp couldnâ€™t force him to listen, let alone to do anything he didnâ€™t wish to, and yet he had a strong aversion to the man. Well, call it fear; he seldom bothered lying to himself. Though why he should fear a man such as that . . .

â€œNo, but . . .â€ Germain struggled to choose among several thoughts that were plainly all trying to emerge into speech at once. â€œGrand-pÃ¨re told me I must stay with his lordship and if Monsieur Beauchamp should come, I must listen to anything they said.â€

â€œReally? Did he say why?â€

â€œNo. But he said it. And, also, I wasâ€”I amâ€”his lordshipâ€™s servant, his orderly. I have a duty to attend him.â€ Germainâ€™s face was touchingly earnest, and Fergus felt his heart squeeze a little. Still . . .

Fergus had never mastered the Scottish way of making crude but eloquent noises in the throatâ€”he rather envied themâ€”but was not bad with similar communications made via the nose.

â€œAccording to what the soldiers said, he is a prisoner of war. Do you mean to accompany him to whatever dungeon or hulk they put him in? Because I think Maman would come and hoick you out of it by the scruff of your neck. Come along, sheâ€™s very worried and waiting to hear that youâ€™re safe.â€

Mention of Marsali had the hoped-for effect; Germain cast down his eyes and bit his lip.

â€œNo, I donâ€™tâ€”I mean, Iâ€™m not . . . well, but, Papa! I have to just go and be sure that Monsieur Beauchamp isnâ€™t doing anything bad to him. And maybe see that he has some food before we leave,â€ he added. â€œYou wouldna have him starve, would you?â€

â€œMilord looked reasonably well nourished,â€ Fergus said, but the urgency on Germainâ€™s face drew him a reluctant step back toward the tent. Germain at once glowed with relief and excitement, seizing his fatherâ€™s hand again.

â€œWhy do you think Monsieur Beauchamp means his lordship harm?â€ Fergus asked, holding Germain back for a moment.

â€œBecause his lordship doesna like him, and neither does Grand-pÃ¨re,â€ the boy said briefly. â€œCome on, Papa! His lordship is unarmed, and who knows what that sodomite has in his pocket?â€

â€œSodomite?â€ Fergus stopped dead in his tracks.

â€œOui, Grand-pÃ¨re says heâ€™s a sodomite. Come on!â€ Germain was nearly frantic now and drew his father on by sheer willpower.

Sodomite? Well, that was interesting. Fergus, observant and very much experienced in the ways of the world and of sex, had some time ago drawn his own conclusions regarding milord Greyâ€™s preferences but had naturally not mentioned these to Jamie, as the English lord was his fatherâ€™s good friend. Did he know? Regardless, that might make his lordshipâ€™s relationship with this Beauchamp a good deal more complex, and he approached the tent with a heightened sense of both curiosity and wariness.

He was prepared to clap his hand over Germainâ€™s eyes and drag him away, should anything untoward be going on in that tent, but before they came close enough to see through the flap, he saw the canvas quiver in a very odd way, and pulled Germain to a halt.

â€œArrÃªte,â€ he said softly. He couldnâ€™t conceive of even the most depraved sexual practices causing a tent to behave in that way and, gesturing to Germain to stay put, moved soft-footed to one side, keeping a little distance among the camp debris.

Sure enough, Lord John was wriggling out under the back edge of the tent, cursing quietly in German. Eyes on this peculiar exhibition, Fergus didnâ€™t notice that Beauchamp had emerged from the front of the tent until he heard Germainâ€™s exclamation and turned to find the boy behind him. He was impressed at Germainâ€™s ability to move quietly, but this was not the time for praise. He motioned to his son and withdrew a little farther, taking cover behind a pile of spiled barrels.

Beauchamp, with a high color in his face, walked off briskly, dusting chaff from the elegant skirts of his coat. Lord John, scrambling to his feet, made off in the other direction, toward the woods, not bothering about his own costume, and no wonder. What on earth had the man been doing, dressed in such a way?

â€œWhat shall we do, Papa?â€ Germain whispered.

Fergus hesitated only a moment, glancing after Beauchamp. The man was heading toward a large inn, likely General Washingtonâ€™s erstwhile center of command. If Beauchamp were remaining with the Continental army, he could be found againâ€”if that proved necessary.

â€œShall we follow Lord John, Papa?â€ Germain was vibrating with anxiety, and Fergus put his hand on the boyâ€™s shoulder to calm him.

â€œNo,â€ he said, firmly but with some regretâ€”he himself was more than curious. â€œClearly his business is urgent, and our presence would be more likely to cause him danger than to help.â€ He didnâ€™t add that Lord John was almost certainly headed for the battlefieldâ€”if there should be one. Such an observation would only make Germain more eager.

â€œButâ€”â€ Germain had his motherâ€™s sense of Scottish stubbornness, and Fergus suppressed a smile at seeing his small blond brows draw down in Marsaliâ€™s exact expression.

â€œHe will be looking either for your grand-pÃ¨re or for his compatriots,â€ Fergus pointed out. â€œEither will take care of him, and in neither case would our presence be useful to him. And your mother will assassinate both of us if we donâ€™t return to Philadelphia within the week.â€

He also didnâ€™t mention that the thought of Marsali and the other children alone in the printshop caused him a great uneasiness. The exodus of the British army and a horde of Loyalists hadnâ€™t rendered Philadelphia safe, by any means. There were a good many looters and lawless men who had moved in to pick over the leavings of those who had fledâ€”and there were plenty still left with Loyalist sympathies who didnâ€™t admit them openly but might easily act upon them under cover of darkness.

â€œCome,â€ he said more gently, and took Germain by the hand. â€œWeâ€™ll need to find some food to eat along the way.â€





JOHN GREY MADE his way through the wood, stumbling now and then by reason of having only one working eye; the ground wasnâ€™t always where he thought it was.

Once away from the campsite, he made no effort to keep out of sight; Claire had packed his eye with cotton lint and wrapped his head in a most professional manner with a gauze bandage to keep the lint in place. It would protect the bad eye while allowing air to dry the skin around it, she said. He supposed it was workingâ€”his eyelids werenâ€™t as raw and sore as they had been, only rather stickyâ€”but at the moment was only grateful that he looked like a wounded man whoâ€™d been left behind by the rushing American army. No one would stop or question him.

Well, no one save his erstwhile comrades of the 16th Pennsylvania, should he have the misfortune to encounter them. God only knew what theyâ€™d thought when he surrendered to Jamie. He felt badly about themâ€”theyâ€™d been very kind to him and must feel their kindness betrayed by the revelation of his identity, but there hadnâ€™t been much bloody choice about it.

There wasnâ€™t much choice about this, either.

â€œThey mean to take your son.â€ It was probably the one thing Percy could have said that would have made him attend.

â€œThey who?â€ heâ€™d said sharply, sitting up. â€œTake him where? And what for?â€

â€œThe Americans. As to what forâ€”you and your brother.â€ Percy had looked him over, shaking his head. â€œDo you have the slightest notion of your value, John?â€

â€œValue to whom?â€ Heâ€™d stood up then, swaying perilously, and Percy had grabbed his hand to steady him. The touch was warm and firm and startlingly familiar. He withdrew his hand.

â€œIâ€™m told I have considerable value as a scapegoat, should the Americans decide to hang me.â€ Where was that bloody note from Hal . . . who had it now? Watson Smith? General Wayne?

â€œWell, that wonâ€™t do at all, will it?â€ Percy appeared undisturbed at thought of Greyâ€™s imminent demise. â€œDonâ€™t worry. Iâ€™ll have a word.â€

â€œWith whom?â€ he asked, curious.

â€œGeneral La Fayette,â€ Percy said, adding with a slight bow, â€œto whom I have the honor of being an adviser.â€

â€œThank you,â€ Grey said dryly. â€œI am not concerned with the possibility of being hangedâ€”at least not right this minuteâ€”but I want to know what the devil you mean about my son, William.â€

â€œThis would be much easier over a bottle of port,â€ Percy said, with a sigh, â€œbut time doesnâ€™t permit, alas. Sit down, at least. You look as though youâ€™re going to fall on your face.â€

Grey sat, with as much dignity as he could muster, and glared up at Percy.

â€œTo put it as simply as possibleâ€”and itâ€™s not simple, I assure youâ€”there is a British officer named Richardsonâ€”â€

â€œI know him,â€ Grey interrupted. â€œHeâ€”â€

â€œI know you do. Be quiet.â€ Percy flapped a hand at him. â€œHeâ€™s an American spy.â€

â€œHeâ€”what?â€ For an instant, he thought he might really fall on his face, despite the fact of sitting down, and grasped the cotâ€™s frame with both hands to prevent this. â€œHe told me that he proposed to arrest Mrs. Fraser for distributing seditious materials. That was what caused me to marry her. Iâ€”â€

â€œYou?â€ Percy goggled at him. â€œYou married?â€

â€œCertainly,â€ Grey said crossly. â€œSo did you, or so you told me. Go on about bloody Richardson. How long has he been spying for the Americans?â€

Percy snorted but obliged.

â€œI donâ€™t know. I became aware of him in the spring of last year, but he may well have been at it before that. Active fellow, Iâ€™ll give him that. And not content with merely gathering information and passing it on, either. Heâ€™s what one might call a provocateur.â€

â€œHeâ€™s not the only one whoâ€™s provoking,â€ Grey muttered, resisting the urge to rub his bad eye. â€œWhatâ€™s he got to do with William?â€ He was beginning to have an unpleasant feeling in his abdomen. He had given William permission to undertake small intelligence-gathering missions for Captain Richardson, whoâ€”

â€œPut as bluntly as possible, heâ€™s tried more than once to lure your son into a position where he might appear to have sympathies with the Rebels. I gather that last year he sent him into the Great Dismal in Virginia, with the intention that he should be captured by a nest of Rebels who have a bastion thereâ€”presumably they would let it be known that he had deserted and joined their forces, while actually holding him prisoner.â€

â€œWhat for?â€ Grey demanded. â€œWill you bloody sit down? Looking up at you is giving me a headache.â€

Percy snorted again and satâ€”not on the conveniently placed stool, but beside Grey on the camp bed, hands on his knees.

â€œPresumably to discredit your familyâ€”Pardloe was making rather inflammatory speeches in the House of Lords at the time, about the conduct of the war.â€ He made a small, impatient gesture that John recognized, a quick flutter of the fingers. â€œI donâ€™t know everythingâ€”yetâ€”but what I do know is that heâ€™s arranged to have your son taken, during the journey to New York. Heâ€™s not bothering with indirection or politics; things have changed, now that France has come into the war. This is simple abduction, with the intent of demanding yourâ€”and Pardloeâ€™sâ€”cooperation in the matter of the Northwest Territoryâ€”and possibly something elseâ€”as the price of the boyâ€™s life.â€

Grey closed his good eye, in an effort to stop his head spinning. Two years before, Percy had abruptly reentered his life, bearing a proposal from certain French â€œinterestsâ€â€”to wit, that these interests wanted the return of the valuable Northwest Territory, presently held by England, and in return for assistance in achieving that goal would offer their influence to keep France from entering the war on the side of the Americans.

â€œThings have changed,â€ he repeated, with an edge.

Percy inhaled strongly through his nose.

â€œAdmiral dâ€™Estaing sailed from Toulon with a fleet, in April. If heâ€™s not already off New York, he will be shortly. General Clinton may or may not know that.â€

â€œJesus!â€ He clenched his fists on the bedframe, hard enough to leave marks from the nailheads. So the bloody French had now officially entered the war. Theyâ€™d signed a Treaty of Alliance with America in February, and declared war on England in March, but talk was cheap. Ships and cannon and men cost money.

Suddenly he grasped Percyâ€™s arm, squeezing hard.

â€œAnd where do you come into this?â€ he said, voice level and cold. â€œWhy are you telling me all this?â€

Percy drew breath, but didnâ€™t jerk away. He returned Greyâ€™s stare, brown eyes clear and direct.

â€œWhere I come into it doesnâ€™t matter,â€ he said. â€œAnd there isnâ€™t time. You need to find your son quickly. As to why I tell you . . .â€

John saw it coming and didnâ€™t pull away. Percy smelled of bergamot and petitgrain and the red wine on his breath. Johnâ€™s grip on Percyâ€™s arm loosened.

â€œPour vos beaux yeux,â€ Percy had whispered against his lipsâ€”and laughed, damn him.





THE SORT OF THING THAT WILL MAKE A MAN SWEAT AND TREMBLE

WE FOLLOWED IN the wake of the army. Because of the speed of march, the soldiers had been instructed to jettison their nonessential equipment, and I had had to abandon many of my supplies, as well. Still, I was mounted and thus would be able to keep up, even loaded with what I managed to keep. After all, I reasoned, it would do me no good to catch up with the army if I had nothing with which to treat wounds when I did.

I had Clarence packed with as much as he could reasonably be expected to carry. As he was a large mule, this was a substantial amount, including my small tent, a folding camp bed for surgery, and all I could cram in, in terms of bandages, lint, and disinfectantâ€”I had both a small cask of purified saline solution and a couple of bottles of straight ethyl alcohol (these disguised as poison, with large skull-and-crossbones labels painted on). Also a jug of sweet oil for burns, my medicine chest, and bundles of raw herbs, large jars of prepared ointment, and dozens of small bottles and vials of tinctures and infusions. My surgical instruments, stitching needles, and sutures were in their own small box, this in a haversack with extra bandage rolls, to be carried on my person.

I left Clarence tied and went to find out where the hospital tents were to be set up. The camp was milling with non-combatants and support personnel, but I was finally able to locate Denny Hunter, who told me that on the basis of General Greeneâ€™s reports, the surgeons were to be dispatched to the village of Freehold, where there was a large church that could be used as a hospital.

â€œThe last thing Iâ€™ve heard is that Lee has taken command of the force attacking the British rear and means to encircle the British,â€ he said, polishing his spectacles on the tail of his shirt.

â€œLee? But I thought he didnâ€™t think it an important command and wouldnâ€™t take it.â€ I wouldnâ€™t care one way or the otherâ€”save that Jamie and his companies would be engaged in that mission, and I had my own doubts about General Lee.

Denzell shrugged, putting his spectacles back on and tucking in his shirttail.

â€œApparently Washington decided that a thousand men were insufficient to his purpose and raised the number to five thousand, which Lee considered more appropriate to his . . . sense of his own importance.â€ Dennyâ€™s mouth twisted a little at this. He looked at my face, though, and touched my arm gently.

â€œWe can but put our trust in Godâ€”and hope that the Lord has his eye upon Charles Lee. Will thee come with the girls and me, Claire? Thy mule will bide with us willingly.â€

I hesitated for no more than a moment. If I rode Clarence, I could take only a fraction of the equipment and supplies he could otherwise carry. And while Jamie had said he wanted me with him, I knew quite well that what he really meant was that he wanted to be assured of where I was, and that I was near at hand if he needed me.

â€œThy husband does trust me with thy welfare,â€ Denny said, smiling, having plainly divined what I was thinking.

â€œEt tu, Brute?â€ I said rather curtly, and, when he blinked, added more civilly, â€œI meanâ€”does everyone know what Iâ€™m thinking, all of the time?â€

â€œOh, I doubt it,â€ he said, and grinned at me. â€œIf they did, I expect a number of them would take a deal more care in what they said to thee.â€

I rode in Dennyâ€™s wagon with Dottie and Rachel, Clarence pacing stolidly along behind, tied to the tailboard. Dottie was flushed with heat and excitement; she had never been near a battle before. Neither had Rachel, but she had helped her brother during a very bad winter at Valley Forge and had much more idea of what the day might hold.

â€œDoes thee think perhaps thee should write to thy mother?â€ I heard Rachel ask seriously. The girls were behind Denny and me, sitting in the bed of the wagon and keeping things from bouncing out when we hit ruts and mud bogs.

â€œNo. Why?â€ Dottieâ€™s tone was waryâ€”not quite hostile, but very reserved. I knew she had written to tell her mother that she intended to wed Denzell Hunter, but she hadnâ€™t received a reply. Given the difficulties of correspondence with England, though, there was no assurance that Minerva Grey had ever read the letter.

It occurred to me, with a sudden qualm, that I hadnâ€™t written a letter to Brianna in several months. I hadnâ€™t been able to bear to write about Jamieâ€™s death, and there hadnâ€™t been time since his return even to think about it.

â€œIt is a war, Dottie,â€ Rachel said. â€œUnexpected things may happen. And thee would not wish thy mother to . . . well . . . to discover that thee had perished without some assurance that she was in thy heart.â€

â€œHmm!â€ said Dottie, clearly taken aback. Beside me, I felt Denzell shift his weight, bending a little forward as he took a fresh grip on the reins. He glanced aside at me, and his mouth turned up in an expression that was as much grimace as smile, acknowledging that heâ€™d been listening to the girlsâ€™ talk, too.

â€œShe worries for me,â€ he said very quietly. â€œNever for herself.â€ He let go the reins with one hand to rub a knuckle under his nose. â€œShe has as much courage as her father and brothers.â€

â€œAs much pigheadedness, you mean,â€ I said under my breath, and he grinned, despite himself.

â€œYes,â€ he said. He glanced over his shoulder and so did I, but the girls had moved to the tailboard and were talking over it to Clarence, brushing flies off his face with the needles of a long pine twig. â€œDoes thee think it a familial lack of imagination? For in the case of the men of her family, it cannot be ignorance of the possibilities.â€

â€œNo, it certainly canâ€™t,â€ I agreed, with a note of ruefulness. I sighed and stretched my legs a little. â€œJamie is the same way, and he certainly doesnâ€™t lack for imagination. I think itâ€™s . . .â€ I made a small helpless gesture. â€œPerhaps â€˜acceptanceâ€™ is the word.â€

â€œAcceptance of the fact of mortality?â€ He was interested and pushed his spectacles back into place. â€œWe have discussed thatâ€”Dorothea and I.â€ He nodded back toward the girls. â€œFriends live in the certain knowledge that this world is temporary and there is nothing to fear in death.â€

â€œSome of that, perhaps.â€ In fact, almost everyone in this time had a very matter-of-fact acceptance of mortality; death was a constant presence at everyoneâ€™s elbow, though they regarded that presence in a variety of ways. â€œBut theyâ€”those menâ€”what they do is something different, I think. Itâ€™s more an acceptance of what they think God made them.â€

â€œReally?â€ He seemed slightly startled by that, and his brows drew together in consideration. â€œWhat does thee mean by that? That they believe God has created them deliberately toâ€”â€

â€œTo be responsible for other people, I think,â€ I said. â€œI couldnâ€™t say whether itâ€™s the notion of noblesse obligeâ€”Jamie was a laird, you know, in Scotlandâ€”or just the idea that . . . thatâ€™s what a man does,â€ I ended, rather lamely. Because â€œthatâ€ was plainly not what Denzell Hunter thought a man should do. Though I did wonder a bit. Plainly the question troubled him a little.

As well it might, given his position. I could see that the prospect of battle excited him and that the fact that it did troubled him a great deal.



â€œYouâ€™re a very brave man,â€ I said quietly, and touched his sleeve. â€œI saw that. When you played Jamieâ€™s deserter game, after Ticonderoga.â€

â€œIt wasnâ€™t courage, I assure thee,â€ he said, with a short, humorless laugh. â€œI didnâ€™t seek to be brave; I only wanted to prove that I was.â€

I made a rather disrespectful noiseâ€”I wasnâ€™t in either Jamieâ€™s or Ianâ€™s class, but I had picked up a few pointersâ€”and he glanced at me in surprise.

â€œI do appreciate the distinction,â€ I told him. â€œBut Iâ€™ve known a lot of brave men in my time.â€

â€œBut how can thee know what liesâ€”â€

â€œBe quiet.â€ I waved my fingers at him. â€œ â€˜Braveâ€™ covers everything from complete insanity and bloody disregard of other peopleâ€™s livesâ€”generals tend to go in for that sortâ€”to drunkenness, foolhardiness, and outright idiocyâ€”to the sort of thing that will make a man sweat and tremble and throw up . . . and go and do what he thinks he has to do anyway.

â€œWhich,â€ I said, pausing for breath and folding my hands neatly in my lap, â€œis exactly the sort of bravery you share with Jamie.â€

â€œThy husband does not sweat and tremble,â€ he said dryly. â€œIâ€™ve seen him. Or, rather, I have not seen him do such things.â€

â€œHe does the sweating and trembling on the inside, mostly,â€ I replied. â€œThough he really does often vomit beforeâ€”or duringâ€”a battle.â€

Denzell blinked, once, and didnâ€™t speak for a bit, absorbedâ€”apparentlyâ€”in steering his way past a large hay wagon whose oxen had suddenly decided they didnâ€™t want to go any farther and stopped dead in the middle of the road.

At last he took a breath and let it out explosively.

â€œI am not afraid to die,â€ he said. â€œThat isnâ€™t my difficulty.â€

â€œWhat is?â€ I asked, curious. â€œAre you afraid of being maimed and left helpless? I certainly would be.â€

â€œNo.â€ His throat moved as he swallowed. â€œItâ€™s Dorothea and Rachel. Iâ€™m afraid I would lack the courage to see them die without trying to save them, even if that meant killing someone.â€

I couldnâ€™t think of anything to say to this, and we jolted on in silence.



LEEâ€™S TROOPS LEFT Englishtown at about 6 A.M., heading east toward Monmouth Courthouse. Lee arrived at the courthouse at about nine-thirty, to find that the bulk of the British army had leftâ€”presumably moving toward Middletown, as that was where the road went.

Lee was prevented from following, though, by the presence of a small but very belligerent rear guard under the command of General Clinton himself. Or so Ian told Jamie, having got close enough to see Clintonâ€™s regimental banners. Jamie had communicated this information to Lee, but saw no evidence that it affected either that gentlemanâ€™s plan of action (always assuming that he had one) or his disinclination to send out more scouts to reconnoiter.

â€œGo round this lot and see can ye find out where Cornwallis is,â€ Jamie told Ian. â€œThe grenadiers ye saw are likely Hessians, so theyâ€™ll be close to von Knyphausen.â€



Ian nodded and took the full canteen Jamie offered him.

â€œShall I tell General Lee, if I do? He didna seem much interested in what I had to say.â€

â€œAye, tell him if ye see him before ye see meâ€”tell the marquis, too, should ye come within reach of himâ€”but find me, regardless, aye?â€

Ian grinned at him and slung the canteen over his pommel.

â€œGood hunting, a BhrÃ thair-mathÃ r!â€

Jamie had had two companies blooded by midmorning, skirmishing near Monmouth Courthouse, but no one killed yet and only three wounded badly enough to retire. Colonel Owen had requested cover for his artilleryâ€”only two cannon, but any artillery was welcomeâ€”and Jamie had sent Thomas Meleagerâ€™s Pennsylvanians to deal with that.

Heâ€™d sent one of Captain Kirbyâ€™s companies to reconnoiter toward what he thought was the creek and kept back the rest, waiting for orders from La Fayette or Lee. La Fayette was somewhere ahead of him, Lee well behind and to the east with the main body of his troops.

The sun stood just short of ten oâ€™clock when a messenger appeared, crouched dramatically in his saddle as though dashing through a hail of bullets, though in fact there was not a British soldier in sight. He pulled his lathered horse to a stop and gasped out his message.

â€œThereâ€™s dust clouds in the eastâ€”might be more redcoats cominâ€™! And the marky says thereâ€™s redcoat cannon in the cider orchard, sir, and will you do summat about it, please.â€

The sweating messenger gulped air, loosening his rein in obvious preparation for dashing off again. Jamie leaned over and seized the horseâ€™s bridle to prevent it.

â€œWhere is the cider orchard?â€ he asked calmly. The messenger was young, maybe sixteen, and wild-eyed as his rawboned horse.

â€œDunno, sir,â€ he said, and began glancing to and fro, as though expecting the orchard to materialize suddenly out of the meadow they were standing in. A sudden distant boom reverberated in Jamieâ€™s bones, and his horseâ€™s ears pricked up.

â€œNever mind, lad,â€ he said. â€œI hear them. Breathe your horse, or heâ€™s like to die under ye before the sunâ€™s high.â€

Letting go the bridle, he waved to Captain Craddock and turned his own horseâ€™s head toward the sound of cannon.



THE AMERICAN ARMY had several hoursâ€™ lead on him, and the British army very much moreâ€”but a man alone could move a great deal faster than even a company of light infantry. Neither was John burdened with weapons. Or food. Or water.

You know perfectly well that heâ€™s lying to you.

â€œOh, be quiet, Hal,â€ Grey muttered to his brotherâ€™s shade. â€œI know Percy a great deal better than you do.â€

I said, you know perfectly well . . .

â€œI do. What am I risking if he is lyingâ€”and what am I risking if heâ€™s not?â€



Hal was high-handed, but logical. He was also a father; that shut him up.

What he was risking if Percy was lying was being shot or hanged out of hand if anyone recognized him. Anyone. If the Americans found him out before he reached the British lines, theyâ€™d arrest him for breaking his parole and promptly execute him as a spy. If the British didnâ€™t recognize him in time, theyâ€™d shoot him on sight as Rebel militia. He put a hand in the pocket where heâ€™d wadded the LIBERTY OR DEATH cap and debated the wisdom of throwing it away, but, in the event, kept it.

What he was risking if Percy wasnâ€™t lying was Willieâ€™s life. No great effort required to call the odds.

It was midmorning, and the air was like treacle, thick and sweet with flowers, sticky with tree sap, and completely unbreathable. His good eye was beginning to itch from the floating pollen grains, and flies were buzzing interestedly round his head, drawn by the scent of honey.

At least the headache had gone away, dispelled by the burst of alarmâ€”and a brief flare of lust, might as well admit itâ€”occasioned by Percyâ€™s revelation. He wouldnâ€™t begin to speculate as to Percyâ€™s motives, but . . .

â€œâ€˜For your beautiful eyes,â€™ indeed!â€ he muttered, but couldnâ€™t help smiling at the impudence. A wise man would not touch Percy Wainwright with a ten-foot pole. Something shorter, though . . .

â€œOh, do be quiet, will you?â€ he murmured to himself, and made his way down a clay bank to the edge of a tiny creek, where he could throw cold water on his heated face.



IT WAS PERHAPS eight oâ€™clock in the morning when we reached Free-hold, where Tennent Church was to be established as the main hospital. It was a large building, set in the midst of a huge, sprawling churchyard, an acre or more of ground whose headstones were as individual as doubtless their owners had been in life. No neat aisles of uniform white crosses here.

I spared a thought for the graves of Normandy and wondered whether those rows upon rows of faceless dead were meant to impose a sort of postmortem tidiness on the costs of warâ€”or whether it was meant rather to underline them, a solemn accounting carried out in endless rows of naughts and crosses.

But I didnâ€™t think long. Battle had been joined alreadyâ€”somewhereâ€”and there were already wounded coming in, a number of men sitting in the shade of a large tree next to the church, more coming down the road, some staggering with the help of friends, some being carried on littersâ€”or in someoneâ€™s arms. My heart lurched at the sight, but I tried not to look for Jamie or Ian; should they be among the early wounded, Iâ€™d know it soon enough.

There was a bustle near the churchâ€™s porch, where the double doors had been flung wide to accommodate passage, and orderlies and surgeons were coming and going in hasteâ€”but organized haste, so far.

â€œGo and see whatâ€™s happening, why donâ€™t you?â€ I suggested to Denzell. â€œThe girls and I will unload things.â€



He paused long enough to unhitch his own two mules and hobble them, then hastened into the church.

I found the buckets and dispatched Rachel and Dottie to find a well. The day was already uncomfortably hot; we were going to need a good deal of water, one way or another.

Clarence was showing a strong urge to go join Dennyâ€™s mules in cropping grass among the headstones, jerking his head against the pull of his tether and uttering loud cries of annoyance.

â€œAll right, all right, all right,â€ I said, hurrying to undo the packing straps and lift his burdens off. â€œHold yourâ€”oh, dear.â€

A man was staggering toward me, giving at the knees with every step and lurching dizzily. The side of his face was black, and there was blood down the facing of his uniform. I dropped the bundle of tenting and poles and rushed to catch him by the arm before he should trip over a headstone and fall face-first into the dirt.

â€œSit down,â€ I said. He looked dazed and appeared not to hear me, but as I was pulling on his arm, he did go down, letting his knees relax abruptly and nearly taking me with him as he landed on a substantial stone commemorating one Gilbert Tennent.

My patient was swaying as though about to fall over, and yet a hasty check showed me no significant wounds; the blood on his coat was from his face, where the blackened skin had blistered and split. It wasnâ€™t just the soot of black powderâ€”the skin had actually been burned to a crisp, the underlying flesh seared, and my patient smelled appallingly like a pork roast. I took a firm grip on my lurching stomach and stopped breathing through my nose.

He didnâ€™t respond to my questions but stared hard at my mouth, and he seemed lucid, despite his continued swaying. The penny finally dropped.

â€œEx . . . plo . . . sion?â€ I mouthed with exaggerated care, and he nodded vigorously, then stopped abruptly, swaying so far that I had to grasp him by the sleeve and pull him upright.

Artilleryman, from his uniform. So something big had exploded near himâ€”a mortar, a cannon?â€”and not only burned his face nearly to the bone but also likely burst both his eardrums and disturbed the balance of his inner ear. I nodded and set his hands to grip the stone he sat on, to keep him in place while I hastily finished unloading Clarenceâ€”who was making the welkin ring with frustration; I should have realized at once that the artilleryman was deaf, as he was taking no notice of the racketâ€”hobbled him, and set him loose to join Dennyâ€™s mules in the shade. I dug what I needed out of the packs and set about to do what little I could for the injured man, this consisting mostly of soaking a towel in saline and applying it to his face like a poultice, to remove as much soot as I could without scrubbing.

I thanked God that Iâ€™d had the forethought to bring a jug of sweet oil for burnsâ€”and cursed my lack of it for not having asked for aloe at Bartramâ€™s Garden.

The girls hadnâ€™t yet returned with water; I hoped there was a well somewhere close at hand. Creek water so close to an army couldnâ€™t be used without boiling it. That thought led me to look round for a spot where a fire could be lighted and to make a mental note to send the girls to look for wood next.

My mind was jerked from my rapidly expanding mental checklist, though, by Dennyâ€™s sudden emergence from the church. He wasnâ€™t alone; he appeared to be having a passionate argument with another Continental officer. With a brief exclamation of exasperation, I dug in my pocket and found my silk-wrapped spectacles. With these on my nose, the face of Dennyâ€™s interlocutor sprang into clear focusâ€”Captain Leckie, diplomate of the Medical College of Philadelphia.

My patient tugged at my skirt and, when I turned to him, apologetically opened his mouth and mimed drinking. I held up a finger, adjuring him to wait one moment, and went to see whether Denzell required reinforcement.

My appearance was greeted by an austere look from Captain Leckie, who viewed me rather as he might have looked at something questionable on the bottom of his shoe.

â€œMrs. Fraser,â€ he said coldly. â€œI have just been telling your Quaker friend that there is no room inside the church for cunning-women orâ€”â€

â€œClaire Fraser is the most skillful surgeon I have seen operate!â€ Denzell said. He was flushed and fairly bristling with anger. â€œYou will do your patients great harm, sir, by not allowing her toâ€”â€

â€œAnd where did you obtain your training, Dr. Hunter, that you are so confident of your own opinion?â€

â€œIn Edinburgh,â€ Denny said through his teeth. â€œWhere I was trained by my cousin, John Hunter.â€ Seeing that this made no impact on Leckie, he added, â€œAnd his brother, William Hunterâ€”accoucheur to the queen.â€

That took Leckie aback, but unfortunately also got up his nose.

â€œI see,â€ he said, dividing a faint sneer evenly between us. â€œI congratulate you, sir. But as I doubt the army requires a man midwife, perhaps you should assist your . . . colleagueâ€â€”and here he actually flared his nostrils at me, the pompous little swineâ€”â€œwith her seeds and potions, rather thanâ€”â€

â€œWe havenâ€™t time for this,â€ I interrupted firmly. â€œDr. Hunter is both a trained physician and a duly appointed surgeon in the Continental army; you canâ€™t bloody keep him out. And if my experience of battleâ€”which I venture to suggest may be somewhat more extensive than your own, sirâ€”is anything to go on, youâ€™ll need every hand you can get.â€ I turned to Denzell and gave him a long, level look.

â€œYour duty is with those who need you. So is mine. I told you about triage, did I not? I have a tent and my own surgical instruments and supplies. Iâ€™ll do triage out here, deal with the minor cases, and send in anyone requiring major surgery.â€

I had a quick look over my shoulder, then turned back to the two fuming men.

â€œYouâ€™d best go inside and be quick about it. Theyâ€™re starting to pile up.â€

This was not a metaphorical expression. There was a crowd of walking wounded under the trees, a few men lying on makeshift stretchers and sheets of canvas . . . and a small, sinister heap of bodies, these presumably men who had died of their wounds en route to the hospital.

Fortunately, Rachel and Dottie appeared at this moment, each lugging a heavy bucket of water in each hand. I turned my back on the men and went to meet them.

â€œDottie, come and put up the tent poles, will you?â€ I said, taking her buckets. â€œAnd, Rachelâ€”you know what arterial bleeding looks like, I imagine. Go and look through those men and bring me anyone whoâ€™s doing it.â€

I gave my burnt artilleryman water, then helped him to his feet. As he stood up, I saw behind his legs the epitaph carved into Gilbert Tennentâ€™s headstone:

O READER HAD YOU HEARD HIS LAST TESTIMONY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVINCED OF THE EXTREME MADNESS OF DELAYING REPENTANCE.

â€œI suppose there are worse places to be doing this,â€ I remarked to the artilleryman, but, unable to hear me, he simply raised my hand and kissed it before swaying off to sit down on the grass, the wet towel pressed to his face.





THE CIDER ORCHARD

THE FIRST SHOT took them by surprise, a muffled boom from the cider orchard and a slow roll of white smoke. They didnâ€™t run, but they stiffened, looking to him for direction. Jamie said to those near him, â€œGood lads,â€ then raised his voice. â€œTo my left, now! Mr. Craddock, Reverend Woodsworthâ€”circle them; come into the orchard from behind. The restâ€”scatter to the right and fire as ye canâ€”â€ The second crash drowned his words, and Craddock jerked like a puppet with his strings cut and dropped to the ground, blood spraying from the blackened hole in his chest. Jamieâ€™s horse shied violently, nearly unseating him.

â€œGo with the reverend!â€ he shouted at Craddockâ€™s men, who stood there drop-jawed, staring at their captainâ€™s body. â€œGo now!â€ One of the men shook himself, grabbed the sleeve of another, pulled him away, and then they all began to move as a body. Woodsworth, bless him, raised his musket overhead and roared, â€œTo me! Follow me!â€ and broke into the stork-legged shamble that passed with him for runningâ€”but they followed him.

The gelding had settled but was moving uneasily. He wasâ€”supposedlyâ€”used to the sound of guns, but he didnâ€™t like the strong smell of blood. Jamie didnâ€™t like it, either.

â€œShouldnâ€™t we . . . bury Mr. Craddock?â€ a timid voice suggested behind him.

â€œHeâ€™s not dead, lackbrain!â€



Jamie glanced down. He wasnâ€™tâ€”but it wouldnâ€™t be more than a few seconds longer.

â€œGo with God, man,â€ he said quietly. Craddock didnâ€™t blink; his eyes were fixed on the sky, not yet dull but sightless.

â€œGo wiâ€™ your fellows,â€ he said to the two lingerers, then saw that they were Craddockâ€™s two sons, maybe thirteen and fourteen, white-faced and staring as sheep. â€œSay farewell to him,â€ he said abruptly. â€œHeâ€™ll still hear ye. Then . . . go.â€ He thought for a moment to send them to La Fayette, but theyâ€™d be no safer there. â€œRun!â€

They ranâ€”they were a deal safer runningâ€”and with a gesture to Lieutenants Orden and Bixby, he wheeled his horse to the right, following Guthrieâ€™s company. The cannon were firing more regularly from the orchard. He saw a ball bounce past, ten feet away, and the air was thickening with smoke. He could still smell Craddockâ€™s blood.

He found Captain Moxley and sent him with a full company to look at the farmhouse on the far side of the orchard.

â€œAt a distance, mind. I want to know if the redcoats are in it or if the familyâ€™s still there. If the familyâ€™s there, surround the house; go inside if theyâ€™ll let ye, but donâ€™t force your way. If there are soldiers inside and they come out after you, engage them and take the house if ye think ye can. If they stay inside, donâ€™t stir them up; send someone back to tell me. Iâ€™ll be at the back oâ€™ the orchard; the north side.â€

Guthrie was waiting for him, the men lying flat in the long grass behind the orchard. He left the two lieutenants with his horse, which he tied to a fence rail well out of range of the orchard, and scrambled along to the company, keeping low. He dropped to his belly by Bob Guthrie.

â€œI need to know where the cannon areâ€”exactly where they are, and how many. Send three or four men in from different directions, goinâ€™ cannyâ€”ye know what I mean? Aye. Theyâ€™re not to do anything; see what they can and come out again, fast.â€

Guthrie was panting like a dog, stubbled face awash with sweat, but he grinned and nodded and wormed his way off through the grass.

The meadow was dry, brown and brittle in the summer heat; Jamieâ€™s stockings prickled with foxtails, and the warm sharp scent of ripe hay was stronger than that of black powder.

He gulped water from his canteen; it was nearly empty. It wasnâ€™t yet noon, but the sun was coming down on them like a flatiron. He turned to tell one of the lieutenants whoâ€™d been following him to go and find the nearest water, but nothing moved in the grass behind him save hundreds of grasshoppers, whirring up like sparks. Gritting his teeth against the stiffness in his knees, he scrambled up onto hands and feet and scuttled back toward his horse.

Orden was lying ten feet away, shot through one eye. Jamie froze for an instant, and something whirred close past his cheek. It might be a grasshopper and it might not. He was flat to the earth beside the dead lieutenant, heart pounding in his ears before the thought had fully formed.

Guthrie. He darenâ€™t raise his head to call outâ€”but had to. He got his feet under him as best he could, shot out of the grass, and ran like a rabbit, to and fro, zigging away from the orchard as best he could while still going in the direction heâ€™d sent Guthrie.

He could hear the shots now: more than one sniper in the orchard, protecting the cannon, and the sound was the flat crack! of a rifle. Jaegers? He flung himself down and crawled madly, now shouting for Guthrie.

â€œHere, sir!â€ The man popped up suddenly beside him like a groundhog, and Jamie seized Guthrieâ€™s sleeve, pulling him back down.

â€œGet . . . your men back.â€ He gulped air, chest heaving. â€œShootingâ€”from the orchard. This side. Theyâ€™ll be picked off.â€

Guthrie was staring at him, mouth half open.

â€œGet them!â€

Shaken out of his shock, Guthrie nodded like a puppet and started to rise. Jamie grabbed him by the ankle and jerked him flat, pressed him down with a hand on his back.

â€œDonâ€™t . . . stand up.â€ His breathing was slowing and he managed to speak calmly. â€œWeâ€™re still in range here. Get your men and retire with your companyâ€”back to the ridgeline. Join Captain Moxley; tell him to come round and join me . . .â€ His mind went blank for a moment, trying to think of some reasonable place for a rendezvous. â€œSouth of the farmhouse. With Woodbineâ€™s company.â€ He took his hand off Guthrie.

â€œAye, sir.â€ The man scuffed up onto hands and knees, reaching for the hat that had fallen off. He glanced back at Jamie, eyes full of earnest concern.

â€œAre you hit bad, sir?â€

â€œHit?â€

â€œThereâ€™s blood all down your face, sir.â€

â€œItâ€™s nothing. Go!â€

Guthrie swallowed, nodded, wiped his face on his sleeve, and made off through the grass, as fast as he could go. Jamie put a hand to his own face, belatedly aware of a slight sting across his cheekbone. Sure enough, his fingers came away bloody. Not a grasshopper, then.

He wiped his fingers on the skirt of his coat and noticed mechanically that the seam of the sleeve had burst at the shoulder, showing the white shirt beneath. He rose a little, cautious, looking round for Bixby, but there was no sign of him. Maybe dead in the long grass, too; maybe not. With luck, heâ€™d seen what was happening and run back to warn the companies coming up. The horse was still where heâ€™d left it, thank God, tethered to a fence, fifty yards away.

He hesitated for a moment, but there wasnâ€™t time to lose in looking for Bixby. Woodsworth and his two companies would be coming round the orchard in a few minutes, and right into range of the German rifles. He popped up and ran.

Something tugged at his coat, but he didnâ€™t stop, and reached his horse, gasping for air.

â€œTiugainn!â€ he said, swinging up into the saddle. He turned away from the orchard and galloped through a potato field, though it bruised his farmerâ€™s heart to see what the armiesâ€™ passing had done to it already.





I DONâ€™T KNOW when physicians began calling it â€œthe Golden Hour,â€ but surely every battlefield medic from the time of the Iliad onward knows about it. From the time of an accident or injury that isnâ€™t immediately fatal, the victimâ€™s chances of living are best if he receives treatment within an hour of sustaining the injury. After that, shock, continued loss of blood, debility due to pain . . . the chance of saving a patient goes sharply downhill.

Add in blazing temperatures, lack of water, and the stress of running full out through fields and woods, wearing wool homespun and carrying heavy weapons, inhaling powder smoke, and trying either to kill someone or avoid being killed, just prior to being injured, and I rather thought we were looking at a Golden fifteen minutes or so.

Given also the fact that the wounded were having to be carried or to walkâ€”probably more than a mileâ€”to a place where they could find assistance . . . I supposed we were doing well to save as many as we were. If only temporarily, I added grimly to myself, hearing the screaming from inside the church.

â€œWhatâ€™s your name, dear?â€ I said to the young man in front of me. He couldnâ€™t be more than seventeen and was precious near to bleeding to death. A bullet had gone through the meat of his upper arm, which would normally be a fortuitous location for a wound. Unfortunately, in this instance the ball had passed through the underside of the arm and nicked the brachial artery, which had been spurting blood in a slow but earnest manner until Iâ€™d taken a death grip on his arm.

â€œPrivate Adams, maâ€™am,â€ he replied, though his lips were white and he was shaking. â€œBilly, they call me,â€ he added politely.

â€œPleased to meet you, Billy,â€ I said. â€œAnd you, sir . . . ?â€ For heâ€™d been brought in staggering, leaning on another boy of about his own ageâ€”and nearly as white-faced, though I thought he wasnâ€™t hurt.

â€œHoratio Wilkinson, maâ€™am,â€ he said, dipping his head in an awkward bowâ€”the best he could manage while holding his friend upright.

â€œLovely, Horatio,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™ve got him now. Would you pour him out a little water, with a splash of brandy in it? Just there.â€ I nodded at the packing case I was using for a table, on which one of my brown bottles marked POISON stood, along with a canteen full of water and wooden cups. â€œAnd as soon as heâ€™s drunk it, give him that leather strip to bite down on.â€

Iâ€™d have told Horatio to have a tot, too, save that there were only two cups, and the second one was mine. I was sipping water steadilyâ€”my bodice was soaked and clung to me like the membrane inside an eggshell, and sweat ran steadily down my legsâ€”and I didnâ€™t want to be sharing the germs of assorted soldiers who didnâ€™t brush their teeth regularly. Still, I might have to tell him to take a quick gulp direct from the brandy bottle; someone was going to have to apply pressure to Billy Adamsâ€™s arm while I stitched his brachial artery, and Horatio Wilkinson didnâ€™t presently look equal to the task.

â€œWould youâ€”â€ I began, but I was holding a scalpel and a suture needle with a dangling ligature in my free hand, and the sight of these overcame young Mr. Wilkinson. His eyes rolled up in his head and he dropped, boneless, into the gravel.



â€œWounded?â€ said a familiar voice behind me, and I turned my head to see Denzell Hunter looking down at Mr. Wilkinson. He was nearly as pale as Horatio and, with strands of hair come loose and clinging to his cheeks, very much the antithesis of his usual collected self.

â€œFainted,â€ I said. â€œCan youâ€”â€

â€œThey are idiots,â€ he said, so paleâ€”with rage, I now realizedâ€”that he could barely speak. â€œRegimental surgeons, they call themselves! A good quarter of them have never seen a man wounded in battle before. And those who have are barely capable of anything in the way of treatment save the crudest amputation. A company of barbers would do better!â€

â€œCan they stop bleeding?â€ I asked, taking his hand and wrapping it round my patientâ€™s upper arm. He automatically pressed his thumb to the brachial artery near the armpit, and the spurting that had started when I took my own hand away stopped again. â€œThank you,â€ I said.

â€œNot at all. Yes, most of them can do that,â€ he admitted, calming down just a little. â€œBut they are so jealous of privilegeâ€”and so much affiliated with their own regimentsâ€”that some are letting a wounded man die because he is not one of theirs and his own regimental surgeon is otherwise occupied!â€

â€œScandalous,â€ I murmured, and, â€œBite hard now, Private,â€ as I thrust the leather between his teeth and made a quick incision to enlarge the wound enough to find the end of the severed artery. He did bite, and made no more than a low grunting noise as the scalpel sliced into his flesh; perhaps he was sufficiently in shock that he didnâ€™t feel it muchâ€”I hoped not.

â€œWe havenâ€™t a lot of choice,â€ I observed, glancing toward the big shade trees that edged the graveyard. Dottie was minding the victims of heatstroke, giving them water andâ€”as time and buckets permittedâ€”dousing them with it. Rachel was in charge of depressed head fractures, abdominal wounds, and other serious wounds that couldnâ€™t be treated by amputation or binding and splinting. In most cases, this amounted to nothing more than comforting them as they died, but she was a good, steady girl, who had seen a great many men die during the winter at Valley Forge; she didnâ€™t shrink from the job.

â€œWe have to let themâ€â€”I jerked my chin toward the church, my hands being occupied in holding Private Adamsâ€™s arm and ligating the severed vesselâ€”â€œdo what theyâ€™re able to do. Not that we could bloody stop them.â€

â€œNo.â€ Denny breathed out, let go of the arm as he saw I had the vessel tied off, and wiped his face on his coat. â€œNo, we canâ€™t. I just needed to express my anger where it wouldnâ€™t cause more trouble. And to ask if I may have some of thy gentian ointment; I saw thee had two good-sized tubs made up.â€

I gave him a small, wry laugh.

â€œBe my guest. That ass Leckie sent an orderly out a little while ago to try to appropriate my stock of lint and bandages. Do you need some, by the way?â€

â€œIf thee has them to spare.â€ He cast a bleak eye over the dwindling pile of supplies. â€œDr. McGillis has sent an orderly to scavenge the neighborhood for items of use and another to carry word back to camp and bring more.â€

â€œTake half,â€ I said, with a nod, and finished wrapping Billy Adamsâ€™s arm with as miserly a bandage as would still do the job. Horatio Wilkinson had recovered himself a little and was sitting up, though still rather pale. Denny hoisted him to his feet and dispatched him with Billy to sit in the shade for a bit.

I was digging through one of my packs for the gentian ointment when I noticed the approach of another party and straightened up to see what their state of need might be.

None of them appeared to be wounded, though all were staggering. They werenâ€™t in uniform and bore no weapons save clubs; no telling whether they were militia, or . . .

â€œWe hear youâ€™ve some brandy, missus,â€ one of them said, reaching out in a quasi-friendly manner and seizing me by the wrist. â€œCome and share it with us, eh?â€

â€œLet go of her,â€ Denzell said, in a tone of deep menace that made the man holding my wrist actually let go in surprise. He blinked at Denzell, whom he evidently hadnâ€™t noticed before.

â€œWho the hellâ€™re you?â€ he asked, though more in tones of befuddled astonishment than confrontation.

â€œIâ€™m a surgeon with the Continental army,â€ Denzell said firmly, and moved to stand beside me, thrusting a shoulder between me and the men, all of whom were clearly very drunk. One of them laughed at this, a high heeheehee sound, and his fellow giggled and poked him, repeating, â€œsurgeon with the Continental ar-my.â€

â€œGentlemen, you must go,â€ Denzell said, edging farther in front of me. â€œWe have wounded men who need attention.â€ He stood with his fists loosely curled, in the attitude of a man ready to do battleâ€”though I was fairly sure he wouldnâ€™t. I hoped intimidation would do the trick, but glanced at my bottle; it was three-quarters emptyâ€”perhaps it would be better to give it to them and hope they went away. . . .

I could see a small party of wounded Continentals coming down the road, two on stretchers, and a few more stumbling, stripped to their bloodied shirts, coats in their hands being dragged in the dust. I reached for the bottle, intending to thrust it at the intruders, but a movement at the corner of my eye made me look toward the shade where the girls were tending prisoners. Both Rachel and Dottie were standing upright, watching the proceedings, and at this point, Dottie, with a strong look of determination on her face, began to walk toward us.

Denny saw her, too; I could see the sudden shift in his posture, a touch of indecision. Dorothea Grey might be a professed Quaker, but her family blood clearly had its own ideas. And I couldâ€”rather to my surpriseâ€”tell exactly what Denzell was thinking. One of the men had already noticed Dottie and had turnedâ€”swayingâ€”in her direction. If she confronted them and one or more of them attacked her . . .

â€œGentlemen.â€ I interrupted the hum of interest among our visitors, and three pairs of bloodshot eyes turned slowly toward me. I withdrew one of the pistols Jamie had given me, pointed it into the air, and pulled the trigger.

It went off with a violent jerk and a blam that momentarily deafened me, along with a puff of acrid smoke that made me cough. I wiped streaming eyes on my sleeve in time to see the visitors departing hastily, with anxious looks back over their shoulders. I located a spare handkerchief tucked into my stays and wiped a smear of soot from my face, emerging from the damp linen folds to find the doors of the church occupied by several surgeons and orderlies, all goggling at me.

Feeling rather like Annie Oakley, and repressing the urge to try to twirl my pistolâ€”mostly for fear I would drop it; it was nearly a foot longâ€”I re-holstered my weapon and took a deep breath. I felt a trifle light-headed.

Denzell was regarding me with concern. He swallowed visibly and opened his mouth to speak.

â€œNot now,â€ I said, my own voice sounding muffled, and nodded toward the men coming toward us. â€œThere isnâ€™t time.â€





THE DANGERS OF SURRENDER

FOUR BLOODY HOURS. Hours spent slogging through an undulant countryside filled with mobs of Continental soldiers, clots of militia, and more bloody rocks than anyplace required for proper functioning, if you asked Grey. Unable to stand the blisters and shreds of raw skin any longer, heâ€™d taken off his shoes and stockings and thrust them into the pockets of his disreputable coat, choosing to hobble barefoot for as long as he could bear it.

Should he meet anyone whose feet looked his size, he thought grimly, heâ€™d pick up one of the omnipresent rocks and avail himself.

He knew he was close to the British lines. He could feel the tremble in the air. The movement of large bodies of men, their rising excitement. And somewhere, no great distance away, the point where excitement was turning to action.

Heâ€™d felt the presence of fighting since just past daylight. Sometimes heard shouting and the hollow boom of muskets. What would I do if I were Clinton? heâ€™d wondered.

Clinton couldnâ€™t outstrip the pursuing Rebels; that was clear. But he would have had time enough to choose decent ground on which to stand and to make some preparation.

Chances were, some part of the armyâ€”Cornwallisâ€™s brigade, maybe; Clinton wouldnâ€™t leave von Knyphausenâ€™s Hessians to stand aloneâ€”would have taken up some defensible position, hoping to hold off the Rebels long enough for the baggage train to get away. Then the main body would wheel and take up its own positionâ€”perhaps occupying a village. Heâ€™d walked through two or three such, each with its own church. Churches were good; heâ€™d sent many a scout up a steeple in his day.

Whereâ€™s William most likely to be? Unarmed and unable to fight, chances were that he was with Clinton. Thatâ€™s where he should be. But he knew his son.

â€œUnfortunately,â€ he muttered. He would, without hesitation, lay down both life and honor for William. That didnâ€™t mean he was pleased at the prospect of having to do so.

Granted, the current circumstance was not Williamâ€™s fault. He had to admitâ€”reluctantlyâ€”that it was at least in part his own. Heâ€™d allowed William to undertake intelligence work for Ezekiel Richardson. He should have looked much more closely into Richardson . . .

The thought of having been gulled by the man was almost as upsetting as what Percy had told him.

He could only hope to run across Richardson in circumstances that would allow him to kill the man unobtrusively. But if it had to be at high noon in full view of General Clinton and his staffâ€”so bloody be it.

He was inflamed in every particular of his being, knew it, and didnâ€™t care.

There were men coming, rumbling up the road behind him. Americans, disorderly, with wagons or caissons. He stepped off the road and stood still in the shade of a tree, waiting for them to pass.

It was a group of Continentals, pulling cannon. Fairly small: ten guns, and only four-pounders. Pulled by men, not mules. It was the only artillery heâ€™d seen in the course of the morning, though; was it all Washington possessed?

They didnâ€™t notice him. He waited a few minutes, until they were out of sight, and followed in their wake.



HE HEARD MORE cannon, some way to his left, and paused to listen. British, by God! Heâ€™d had somewhat to do with artillery, early in his military career, and the rhythm of a working gun crew was embedded in his bones.

Sponge piece!

Load piece!

Ram!

Fire!

A single artillery unit. Ten-pounders, six of them. They had something in range but werenâ€™t being attacked; the firing was sporadic, not that of hot combat.

Though, to be fair, any physical effort whatever had to be described as â€œhotâ€ today. He lunged into a patch of trees, exhaling in relief at the shade. He was ready to expire in his black coat and took it off for a momentâ€™s respite. Dare he abandon the bloody thing altogether?

Heâ€™d seen a band of militia earlier, shirtsleeved, some with kerchiefs tied over their heads against the sun. Coated, though, he might bluff his way as a militia surgeonâ€”the beastly garment smelled badly enough.

He worked his tongue, bringing a little saliva to his dry mouth. Why the devil had he not thought to bring a canteen when heâ€™d fled? Thirst decided him to make his move now.

Dressed as he was, he might well be shot by any infantryman or dragoon who saw him, before he could speak a word. But while cannon were very effective indeed against a massed enemy, they were almost useless against a single man, as the aim couldnâ€™t be adjusted quickly enough to bear, unless the man was fool enough to advance in a straight lineâ€”and Grey was not that foolish.

Granted, the officer in charge of each gunâ€™s crew would be armed with sword and pistol, but a single man approaching an artillery unit on foot could be no conceivable danger; sheer amazement would likely let him get within earshot. And pistols were so inaccurate at anything over ten paces, he wasnâ€™t risking much anyway, he reasoned.

He hastened his step as much as he could, a wary eye out. There were a lot of Continental troops in his vicinity now, marching furiously. The regulars would take him for walking wounded, but he darenâ€™t try to surrender to the British lines while combat was joined, or heâ€™d be the walking dead in short order.

The artillery in the orchard might be his best chance, hair-raising as it was to walk into the mouths of the guns. With a muffled oath, he put his shoes back on and began to run.



HE RAN HEAD-ON into a militia company, but they were headed somewhere at the trot and gave him no more than a cursory glance. He swerved aside into a hedgerow, where he floundered for a moment before breaking through. He was in a narrow field, much trampled, and on the other side of it was an apple orchard, only the crowns of the trees showing above a heavy cloud of white powder smoke.

He caught a glimpse of movement beyond the orchard and risked a few steps to the side to lookâ€”then ducked back hastily out of sight. American militia, men in hunting shirts or homespun, a few shirtless and glistening with sweat. They were massing there, likely planning a rush into the orchard from behind, in hopes of capturing or disabling the guns.

They were making a good deal of noise, and the guns had stopped firing. Plainly the artillerymen knew the Americans were there and would be making preparations to resist. Not the best time to come calling, then . . .

But then he heard the drums. Well in the distance, to the east of the orchard, but the sound carried clearly. British infantry on the march. A better prospect than the artillery in the orchard. Moving, infantry wouldnâ€™t be disposed or prepared to shoot a single, unarmed man, no matter how he was dressed. And if he could get close enough to attract the attention of an officer . . . but heâ€™d still have to cross the open ground below the orchard in order to reach the infantry before theyâ€™d marched off out of reach.

Biting his lip with exasperation, he shoved through the hedgerow and ran through the clouds of drifting smoke. A shot cracked the air much too near him. He flung himself into the grass by instinct, but then leapt up and ran again, gasping for breath. Christ, there were riflemen in the orchard, defending the cannon! Jaegers.

But most of the riflemen must be facing the other way, ready to meet the gathering militia, for no more shots came on this side of the orchard. He slowed down, pressing a hand to the stitch in his side. He was past the orchard now. He could still hear the drums, though they were drawing away . . . keep going, keep going . . .

â€œHoy! You there!â€ He should have kept going but, short of breath and unsure who was calling, paused for an instant, half-turning. Only half, because a solid body hurtled through the air and knocked him down.

He hit the ground on one elbow and was already grappling the manâ€™s head with his other hand, wet greasy hair sliding through his fingers. He jabbed at the manâ€™s face, squirmed eel-like out from under his weight, kneeing the fellow in the stomach as he moved, and made it lurching to his feet.

â€œStop right there!â€ The voice cracked absurdly, shooting up into a falsetto, and startled him so that he did stop, gasping for breath.

â€œYou . . . no-account . . . filthy . . .â€ The manâ€”no, by God, it was a boy!â€”whoâ€™d knocked him down was getting to his feet. He had a large stone in his hand; his brotherâ€”it had to be his brother; they looked like two peas in a pod, both half grown and gawky as turkey poultsâ€”had a good-sized club.

Greyâ€™s hand had gone to his waist as heâ€™d risen, ready to draw the dagger Percy had given him. Heâ€™d seen these boys before, he thoughtâ€”the sons of the commander of one of the New Jersey militia companies?â€”and, rather clearly, theyâ€™d seen him before, too.

â€œTraitor!â€ One of them yelled at him. â€œBloody fucking spy!â€ They were between him and the distant infantry company; the orchard was at his back, and the three of them were well within range of any Hessian rifleman who happened to look in their direction.

â€œLookâ€”â€ he began, but could see that it was pointless. Something had happened; they were crazed with somethingâ€”terror, anger, grief?â€”that made their features shift like water and their limbs tremble with the need to do something immediate and violent. They were boys, but both taller than he was and quite capable of doing him the damage they clearly intended.

â€œGeneral Fraser,â€ he said loudly, hoping to jar them into uncertainty. â€œWhere is General Fraser?â€





THE PRICE OF BURNT SIENNA

â€œCOMPANIES ALL present, sir!â€ Robert MacCammon rushed up, panting. He was a heavyset man, and even the gently rolling fields and meadows were hard on him; the dark stains in his oxters were the size of dinner plates.

â€œAye, good.â€ Jamie glanced beyond Major MacCammon and saw Lieutenant Herbertâ€™s company emerging from a small wood, glancing cautiously round, their weapons in their hands. They were doing well, untrained as they were, and he was pleased with them.

Lord, let me bring them through it as best I can.

This prayer barely formed in his mind, he turned to look toward the west, and froze. On the slope below him, no more than a hundred yards away, he saw the two Craddock boys, armed with a rock and a stick, respectively, menacing a man whose back was turned to him but whose bare, cropped blond head was instantly recognizable, even without the stained bandage tied round it.

Then he saw Grey put a hand to his waist and knew beyond the shadow of doubt that it was a knife he reached for.

â€œCraddock!!â€ he bellowed, and the boys both started. One dropped his rock and stooped to pick it up again, exposing his scrawny neck to Grey. Grey looked at the vulnerable expanse of flesh, glanced bleakly at the older boy, gripping his stick like a cricket bat, then up the slope at Jamie, and let both hands and shoulders drop.

â€œIfrinn!â€ Jamie muttered under his breath. â€œStay here,â€ he said briefly to Bixby, and ran down the slope, stumbling and pushing his way through a thick growth of alders that left sticky sap all over his hands.

â€œWhere the devil is your company?â€ he demanded without preamble, breathing hard as he came up with the boys and Grey.

â€œOh. Er . . .â€ The younger Craddock looked to his brother to answer.

â€œWe couldnâ€™t find â€™em, sir,â€ the older boy said, and swallowed. â€œWe were looking, when we run into a party of redcoats and had to scamper pretty quick to get away.â€

â€œThen we saw him,â€ the younger Craddock said, thrusting out his chin at Grey. â€œEverybody in camp had said as how he was a redcoat spy, and, sure enough, there he was, makinâ€™ for them, waving and callinâ€™ out.â€

â€œSo we thought as how it was our duty to stop him, sir,â€ the older boy put in, anxious not to be eclipsed by his brother.

â€œAye, I see.â€ Jamie rubbed the spot between his eyebrows, which felt as though a small, painful knot had formed there. He glanced over his shoulder. Men were still running up from the south, but the rest of Craddockâ€™s company was nearly all there, milling anxiously and looking in his direction. No wonder: he could hear British drums, near at hand. Doubtless that was the company the boys had run intoâ€”the one Grey had been making for.

â€œWenn ich etwas sagen dÃ¼rfte,â€ Grey said in German, with a glance at the Craddocks. If I might speak . . .

â€œYou may not, sir,â€ Jamie replied, with some grimness. There wasnâ€™t timeâ€”and if these two wee blockheids survived to get back to camp, theyâ€™d recount every word that had passed between Grey and him to anyone who would listen. The last thing he could afford was for them to report him involved in foreign confabulation with an English spy.

â€œI am in search of my son!â€ Grey switched to English, with another glance at the Craddocks. â€œI have reason to believe heâ€™s in danger.â€

â€œSo is everyone else out here,â€ Jamie replied with an edge, though his heart jerked in his chest. So that was why Grey had broken his parole. â€œIn danger from whom?â€

â€œSir! Sir!â€ Bixbyâ€™s voice was shouting from the other side of the alders, high and urgent. He had to go, and quickly.

â€œComing, Mr. Bixby!â€ he shouted. â€œWhy didnâ€™t you kill them?â€ he asked Grey abruptly, and jerked his head toward the Craddocks. â€œIf you got past them, you could have made it.â€

One fair brow arched above the handkerchief binding Greyâ€™s bad eye.

â€œYouâ€™d forgive me for Claireâ€”but not for killing your . . . men.â€ He glanced at the two Craddocks, spotty as a pair of raisin puddings andâ€”Greyâ€™s look impliedâ€”likely no brighter.

For a split second, the urge to punch him again surged up from Jamieâ€™s bowels, and for the same split second, the knowledge of it showed on John Greyâ€™s face. He didnâ€™t flinch, and his good eye widened in a pale-blue stare. This time, heâ€™d fight back.

Jamie closed his eyes for an instant, forcibly setting anger aside.

â€œGo with this man,â€ he said to the Craddocks. â€œHe is your prisoner.â€ He pulled one of the pistols from his belt and presented it to the elder Craddock, who received it with wide-eyed respect. Jamie didnâ€™t bother telling the lad it was neither loaded nor primed.

â€œAnd you,â€ he said evenly to Grey. â€œGo with them behind the lines. If the Rebels still hold Englishtown, guide them there.â€

Grey nodded curtly, lips compressed, and turned to go.

He reached out and caught Grey by the shoulder. The man whipped round, blood in his eye.

â€œListen to me,â€ Jamie said, speaking loudly enough to be sure the Crad-dock boys could hear him. â€œI revoke your parole.â€ He fixed Greyâ€™s single-eyed glare with one of his own. â€œDâ€™ye understand me? When you reach Englishtown, yeâ€™ll surrender yourself to Captain McCorkle.â€

Greyâ€™s mouth twitched, but he said nothing and gave the merest nod of acknowledgment before turning away.

Jamie turned, too, running for his waiting companies, but risked a single glance over his shoulder.



Shooing the Craddocks before him, awkward and flapping as a pair of geese bound for market, Grey was headed smartly to the south, toward the American linesâ€”if the concept of â€œlinesâ€ held any meaning in this goddamned battle.

Grey had certainly understood, and despite the present emergency, a weight lifted from Jamieâ€™s heart. With his parole revoked, John Grey was once more a prisoner of war, in the custody of his jailors, officially without freedom of movement. But also without the obligation of honor that would hold him prisoner on his own recognizance. Without parole, his primary duty now was that of any soldier in the hands of his enemyâ€”escape.

â€œSir!â€ Bixby arrived at his shoulder, panting. â€œThere are redcoatsâ€”â€

â€œAye, Mr. Bixby. I hear them. Letâ€™s be having them, then.â€



IF IT WERENâ€™T for the coloring book, I might not have noticed immediately. In third or fourth grade, Brianna had had a coloring book featuring scenes from the American Revolution. Sanitized, suitably romantic scenes: Paul Revere flying through the night on a galloping horse, Washington crossing the Delaware while exhibiting (as Frank pointed out) a lamentable lack of seamanship . . . and a double-paged spread featuring Molly Pitcher, that gallant woman who had carried water to the heat-stricken troops (left-hand page) and then taken her wounded husbandâ€™s place to serve his cannon (right-hand page)â€”at the Battle of Monmouth.

Which, it had dawned on me, was very likely what the battle we were engaged in was going to be called, once anyone got round to naming it. Monmouth Courthouse was only two or three miles from my present location.

I wiped my face once moreâ€”this gesture did nothing for the perspiration, which was instantly renewed, but, judging from the state of my three soggy handkerchiefs, was removing a fair amount of dirt from my countenanceâ€”and glanced toward the east, where I had been hearing distant cannon fire most of the day. Was she there?

â€œWell, George Washington certainly is,â€ I murmured to myself, pouring out a fresh cup of water and returning to my work rinsing out bloody cloths in a bucket of salt water. â€œWhy not Molly Pitcher?â€

It had been a complicated picture to color, and as Bree had just got to the phase where she insisted that things be colored â€œreal,â€ the cannon could not be pink or orange, and Frank had obligingly drawn several crude cannon on a sheet of paper and tried out everything from gray (with shadings of black, blue, blue-violet, and even cornflower) to brown, with tints of burnt sienna and gold, before they finally settledâ€”Frankâ€™s opinion as to actual historicity of cannon being diffidently advancedâ€”on black with dark green shadings.

Lacking credentials, I had been relegated to coloring in the grass, though I also got to help with the dramatic shading of Mrs. Pitcherâ€™s raggedly streaming clothes, once Brianna got tired of it. I looked up, the smell of crayons strong in my memory, and saw a small group coming down the road.

There were two Continental regularsâ€”and a man in what I recognized as the light-green uniform of Skinnerâ€™s Greens, a Provincial Loyalist regiment. He was stumbling badly, though supported on both sides by the Continentals. The shorter of these also seemed to be wounded; he had a bloodstained scarf wrapped around one arm. The other was looking from side to side as though on guard, but didnâ€™t seem to be wounded.

At first Iâ€™d looked at the Provincial, who must be a prisoner. But then I looked more closely at the wounded Continental supporting him. And with Molly Pitcher so clearly and recently in mind, I realized with a small shock that the Continental was a woman. The Continentalâ€™s coat covered her hips, but I could plainly see the way in which her legs slanted in toward the knee; a manâ€™s thighbones run straight up and down, but a womanâ€™s width of pelvic basin compels a slightly knock-kneed stance.

It also became clear, by the time they reached me, that the wounded soldiers were related: both were short and thin, with squared-off chins and sloping shoulders. The Provincial was definitely male, thoughâ€”his face was thickly stubbledâ€”while his . . . sister? They seemed close in age . . . was clear-skinned as an egg and nearly as white.

The Provincial was not. He was red as a blast furnace and nearly as hot to the touch. His eyes were white slits, and his head wobbled on his spindly neck.

â€œIs he wounded?â€ I asked sharply, putting a hand under his shoulder to ease him down onto a stool. He went limp the moment his buttocks touched it and would have fallen to the ground had I not tightened my grip. The girl gave a frightened gasp and put out a hand toward him, but she also staggered and would have fallen, had the other man not seized her by the shoulders.

â€œHe took a blow to the head,â€ the male Continental said. â€œIâ€”hit him with the hilt of my sword.â€ This admission was made with some embarrassment.

â€œHelp me lay him down.â€ I ran my hand over the Provincialâ€™s head, detecting an ugly, contused wound under his hair, but found no crepitation, no sense of a skull fracture. Concussion, likely, but maybe no worse. He began to twitch under my hand, though, and the tip of his tongue protruded from his mouth.

â€œOh, dear,â€ I said, under my breath, but not far enough under, for the girl gave a small, despairing cry.

â€œItâ€™s heatstroke,â€ I told her at once, hoping this might sound reassuring. The reality was far from it; once they collapsed and fell into seizures, they usually died. Their core temperature was far above what the systems of the body could tolerate, and seizing like that was often an indication that brain damage had started to occur. Stillâ€”

â€œDottie!â€ I bellowed, and made urgent gestures at her, then turned to the soundâ€”but very frightened-lookingâ€”Continental soldier. â€œSee that young woman in gray? Drag him over into the shade where she is; sheâ€™ll know what to do.â€ It was simple. Pour water over him andâ€”if possibleâ€”into him. That was the sum total of what could be done. Meanwhile . . .

I got hold of the girl by the non-wounded arm and sat her down on the stool, hastily pouring most of what remained in my brandy bottle into a cup. She didnâ€™t look as though she had much blood left.

She didnâ€™t. When I got the scarf off, I discovered that her hand was missing, and the forearm badly mangled. She hadnâ€™t bled to death only because someone had twined a belt round her upper arm and fastened the tourniquet tight with a stick thrust through it. It had been a long time since Iâ€™d fainted at sight of anything, and I didnâ€™t now, but did have one brief moment when the world shifted under my feet.

â€œHow did you do that, sweetheart?â€ I asked, as calmly as possible. â€œHere, drink this.â€

â€œIâ€”grenado,â€ she whispered. Her head was turned away, not to see the arm, but I guided the cup to her lips and she drank, gulping the mix of brandy and water.

â€œSheâ€”he picked it up,â€ said a low, choked voice at my elbow. The other Continental was back. â€œIt rolled by my foot and heâ€”she picked it up.â€

The girl turned her head at his voice, and I saw his anguished look.

â€œShe came into the army because of you, I suppose?â€ Clearly the arm would have to be amputated; there was nothing below the elbow that could be saved, and to leave it in this state was to doom her to death by infection or gangrene.

â€œNo, I didnâ€™t!â€ the girl said, huffing for breath. â€œPhilâ€”â€ She gulped air and twisted her head to look toward the trees. â€œHe tried to make me go with him. Loyalist c-camp . . . follower. Wouldnâ€™t.â€ With so little blood remaining in her body, she was having trouble getting enough oxygen. I refilled the cup and made her drink again; she emerged from it spluttering and swaying, but more alert. â€œIâ€™m a patriot!â€

â€œIâ€”I tried to make her go home, maâ€™am,â€ the young man blurted. â€œBut wasnâ€™t anyone left to look out for her.â€ His hand hovered an inch from her back, wanting to touch her, waiting to catch her if she fell over.

â€œI see. Himâ€”â€ I nodded toward Dottieâ€™s station under the trees, where the man with heatstroke lay in the shade. â€œYour brother?â€

She hadnâ€™t the strength to nod, but closed her eyes briefly in acquiescence.

â€œHer father died just after Saratoga.â€ The young man looked completely wretched. Christ, he couldnâ€™t be more than seventeen, and she looked about fourteen, though she must be older. â€œPhillip was already gone; heâ€™d broke with his father when he joined the Provincials. Iâ€”â€ His voice broke, and he shut his mouth hard and touched her hair.

â€œWhatâ€™s your name, dear?â€ I said. Iâ€™d loosened the tourniquet to check that there was still blood flow to the elbow; there was. Possibly the joint could be saved.

â€œSally,â€ she whispered. Her lips were white, but her eyes were open. â€œSarah.â€ All my amputation saws were in the church with Denzellâ€”I couldnâ€™t send her in there. Iâ€™d stuck my head in once and nearly been knocked over by the thick smell of blood and excrementâ€”even more by the atmosphere of pain and terror and the sounds of butchery.

There were more wounded coming along the road; someone would have to tend them. I hesitated for no more than a minute.

Both Rachel and Dottie had the necessary resolve to deal with things and the physical presence to command distraught people. Rachelâ€™s manner came from months of experience at Valley Forge, Dottieâ€™s more from a habit of autocratic expectation that people would of course do what she wanted them to. Both of them inspired confidence, and I was proud of them. Between them, they were managing as well as could be expected, andâ€”I thoughtâ€”much better than the surgeons and their assistants in the church, though these were commendably quick about their bloody business.

â€œDottie!â€ I called again, and beckoned. She rose and came at the trot, wiping her face on her apron. I saw her look at the girlâ€”at Sarahâ€”then turn with a brief look at the bodies on the grass, and turn back with a look in which curiosity, horror, and a desperate compassion were blended. So the brother was dead already, or dying.

â€œGo and get Denzell, Dottie,â€ I said, moving just a little so that she could see the mangled arm. She turned white and swallowed. â€œTell him to bring my bow-frame saw and a small tenaculum.â€

Sarah and the young man made small gasps of horror at the word â€œsaw,â€ and then he moved swiftly, touching her at last, gripping her by her sound shoulder.

â€œYouâ€™ll be all right, Sally,â€ he said fiercely. â€œIâ€™ll marry you! Wonâ€™t make a blind bit of difference to me. I meanâ€”yourâ€”your arm.â€ He swallowed, hard, and I realized that he needed water, too, and passed over the canteen.

â€œLike . . . hell,â€ Sally said. Her eyes were dark and bright as unfired coal in her white face. â€œI wonâ€™tâ€”be married for pity. Damn . . . you. Nor guilt. Donâ€™t . . . need you!â€

The young manâ€™s face was blank with surpriseâ€”and, I thought, affront.

â€œWell, what are you going to live on?â€ he demanded, indignant. â€œYou donâ€™t own a thing in this world but that damned uniform! Youâ€”youâ€”â€ He pounded a fist on his leg in frustration. â€œYou canâ€™t even whore, with one arm!â€

She glared at him, breathing slow and hard. After a moment, a thought crossed her face and she nodded a little and turned to me.

â€œYou reckon the army might . . . pay me . . . a pension?â€ she asked.

I could see Denzell now, blood-splattered but collected, hurrying across the gravel with the box of surgical instruments. I would have sold my soul for ether or laudanum, but had neither. I took a deep breath of my own.

â€œI expect they will. Theyâ€™ll give Molly Pitcher one; why not you?â€





IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME

WILLIAM TOUCHED his jaw gingerly, congratulating himself that Tarleton had only managed to hit him in the face once, and it hadnâ€™t been in the nose. His ribs, arms, and abdomen were another matter, and his clothes were muddy and his shirt rent, but it wouldnâ€™t be apparent to a casual observer that heâ€™d been in a fight. He might just get away with itâ€”so long as Captain AndrÃ© didnâ€™t happen to mention the dispatch to the British Legion. After all, Sir Henry had had his hands full during the morning, if half what William had heard along his way was true.

A wounded infantry captain on his way back to camp had told of seeing Sir Henry, in command of the rear guard, lead a charge against the Americans, getting so far out to the front that he was nearly captured before the men behind came up to him. William had burned, hearing thisâ€”he would have loved to be part of that. But at least he hadnâ€™t stayed mewed up in the clerksâ€™ tent. . . .

He was no more than a quarter mile along his way back to Cornwallisâ€™s brigade when Goth threw a shoe. William said something very bad, pulled up, and swung down to have a look. He found the shoe, but two nails had gone and a quick search didnâ€™t turn them up; no chance of hammering it back on with the heel of his boot, which had been his first thought.

He shoved the shoe in his pocket and looked round. Soldiers swarmed in every direction, but there was a company of Hessian grenadiers on the opposite side of the ravine, forming up at the bridgehead. He led Goth across, stepping gingerly.

â€œHallo!â€ he called to the nearest fellow. â€œWo ist der nÃ¤chste Hufschmied?â€

The man glanced indifferently at him and shrugged. A young fellow, though, pointed across the bridge and called out, â€œZwei Kompanien hinter uns kommen Husaren!â€ Hussars are coming, two companies behind!

â€œDanke!â€ William called back, and led Goth into the sparse shade of a stand of spindly pines. Well, that was luck. He wouldnâ€™t have to walk the horse a long way; he could wait for the farrier and his wagon to come to him. Still, he fretted at the delay.

Every nerve was keyed tight as a harpsichord string; he kept touching his belt, where his weapons would normally be. He could hear the sounds of musket fire in the far distance, but couldnâ€™t see a thing. The countryside was folded up like a leporello, rolling meadow diving suddenly into wooded ravines, then springing back out, only to disappear again.

He dug out his handkerchief, so soggy by now that it served only to sluice the sweat from his face. He caught a faint breath of coolness wafting up from the creek, forty feet below, and walked nearer the edge in hopes of more. He drank warm water from his canteen, wishing he could scramble down and drink from the stream, but he darenâ€™t; he might get down the steep slope without trouble, but coming back up would be an awkward climb, and he couldnâ€™t risk missing the farrier.

â€œEr spricht Deutsch. Er gehÃ¶rt!â€ Heard what? He hadnâ€™t been paying attention to the grenadiersâ€™ sporadic conversation, but these hissed words came to him clearly, and he glanced round to see who it was they were saying spoke German, only to see two of the grenadiers quite close behind him. One of them grinned nervously at him, and he stiffened.

Suddenly two more were there, between him and the bridge. â€œWas ist hier los?â€ he demanded sharply. â€œWas machst Ihr da?â€ What is this? What are you doing?

A burly fellow pulled an apologetic face.

â€œVerzeihung. Ihr seid hier falsch.â€

Iâ€™m in the wrong place? Before William could say anything more, they closed on him. He elbowed, punched, kicked, and butted wildly, but it didnâ€™t last more than a few seconds. Hands pulled his arms behind him, and the burly fellow said once more, â€œVerzeihung,â€ and, still looking apologetic, bashed him in the head with a rock.

He didnâ€™t lose consciousness altogether until he hit the bottom of the ravine.



THERE WAS THE devil of a lot of fighting, Ian thoughtâ€”but that was about all you could say about it. There was a good deal of movementâ€”particularly among the Americansâ€”and whenever they met with a group of redcoats, there was fighting, often ferocious fighting. But the countryside was so irregular, the armies seldom came together anywhere in large numbers.

He had found his way around several companies of British infantry more or less lying in wait, though, and beyond this vanguard were a goodly number of British, regimental banners in the midst of them. Would it help to know who was in command here? He wasnâ€™t sure he could tell, even if he was close enough to make out the details of the banners.

His left arm ached, and he rubbed it absently. The ax wound had healed well, though the scar was still raised and tenderâ€”but the arm hadnâ€™t yet recovered anything like its full strength, and loosing an arrow at the Indian scouts earlier had left the muscles quivering and jumping, with a burning deep in the bone.

â€œBest not try that again,â€ he murmured to Rolloâ€”then remembered that the dog wasnâ€™t with him.



He looked up and discovered that one of the Indian scouts was with him, though. Or at least he thought so. Twenty yards away, an Abenaki warrior sat on a rawboned pony, eyeing Ian thoughtfully. Yes, Abenaki, he was sure of it, seeing the scalp shaved clean from brows to crown and the band of black paint across the eyes, the long shell earrings that brushed the manâ€™s shoulders, their nacre glittering in the sun.

Even as he made these observations, he was turning his own mount, seeking shelter. The main body of men was a good two hundred yards distant, standing in open meadow, but there were stands of chestnut and poplar, and perhaps a half mile back the way heâ€™d come, the rolling land dipped into one of the big ravines. Wouldnâ€™t do to be trapped in the low ground, but if he had enough lead, it was a good way to disappear. He kicked his horse sharply and they shot off, turning abruptly left as they passed a patch of thick growthâ€”and a good thing, too, because he heard something heavy whiz past his head and go crashing into the growth. Throwing stick? Tomahawk?

It didnâ€™t matter; the only important thing was that the man whoâ€™d thrown it was no longer holding it. He did look back, thoughâ€”and saw the second Abenaki come round the grove from the other side, ready to cut him off. The second one shouted something and the other answeredâ€”hunting cries. Beast in view.

â€œCuidich mi, a Dhia!â€ he said, and jammed his heels hard into his horseâ€™s sides. The new mare was a good horse, and they made it out of the open ground, crashed through a small copse of trees and out the other side to find a rail fence before them. It was too close to stop, and they didnâ€™t; the horse dropped her hindquarters, bunched, and soared over, back hooves clipping the top rail with a solid whank! that made Ian bite his tongue.

He didnâ€™t look back but bent low over his horseâ€™s neck, and they ran flat out for the curving land he could see before him, dropping down. He turned and ran at an angle, not wanting to hit the edge of the ravine straight on, in case it should be steep just there. . . . No sound from behind save the rumble and clash of the army massing. No yelps, no hunting calls from the Abenaki.

There it was, the thick growth that marked the edge of the ravine. He slowed and now risked a look over his shoulder. Nothing, and he breathed and let the horse slow to a walk, picking their way along the edge, looking for a good way down. The bridge was just visible above him, maybe fifty yards distant, but no one was on itâ€”yet.

He could hear men fighting in the ravineâ€”perhaps three hundred yards from where he wasâ€”but there was sufficient growth that he was hidden from them. Only a scuffle, from the soundsâ€”heâ€™d heard or seen that a dozen times already today; men on both sides, driven by thirst down to the creeks that had carved the ravines, occasionally meeting and going for one another in a bloody splash among the shallows.

The thought of it reminded him of his own thirstâ€”and the horseâ€™s, for the creature was stretching out her neck, nostrils greedily flaring at the scent of water.

He slid off and led the way down to the creekâ€™s edge, careful of loose stones and boggy earthâ€”the creek bank here was mostly soft mud, edged with mats of duckweed and small reedbeds. A glimpse of red caught his eye and he tensed, but it was a British soldier, facedown in the mud and clearly dead, his legs swaying in the current.

He shucked his moccasins and edged out into the water himself; the creek was fairly wide here and only a couple of feet deep, with a silty bottom; he sank in ankle-deep. He edged out again and led the horse farther up the ravine, looking for better footing, though the mare was desperate for the water, pushing Ian with her head; she wouldnâ€™t wait long.

The sounds of the skirmish had faded; he could hear men up above and some way off, but nothing in the ravine itself anymore.

There, that would do. He let the horseâ€™s reins fall, and she lunged for the creek, stood with her forefeet sunk in mud but her hind feet solid on a patch of gravel, blissfully gulping water. Ian felt the pull of the water nearly as much and sank to his knees, feeling the blissful chill as it soaked his clout and leggings, that sensation fading instantly to nothingness as he cupped his hands and drank, and cupped and drank again and again, choking now and then in the effort to drink faster than he could swallow.

At last he stoppedâ€”reluctantlyâ€”and dashed water over his face and chest; it was cooling, though the bear grease in his paint made the water bead and run off his skin.

â€œCome on,â€ he said to the horse. â€œYeâ€™ll burst and ye keep on like that, amaidan.â€ It took some struggle, but he got the horseâ€™s nose out of the creek, water and bits of green weed sloshing out of the loose-lipped mouth as the horse snorted and shook her head. It was while hauling the horseâ€™s head round in order to lead her up the bank that he saw the other British soldier.

This one was lying near the bottom of the ravine, too, but not in the mud. He was lying facedown, but with his head turned to one side, and . . .

â€œOch, Jesus, no!â€ Ian flung his horseâ€™s reins hastily round a tree trunk and bounded up the slope. It was, of course. Heâ€™d known it from the first glimpse of the long legs, the shape of the head, but the face made it certain, even masked with blood as it was.

William was still alive; his face twitched under the feet of a half-dozen black flies feeding on his drying blood. Ian put a hand under his jaw, the way Auntie Claire did, but, with no idea how to find a pulse or what a good one should feel like, took it away again. William was lying in the shadow of a big sycamore, but his skin was still warmâ€”it couldnâ€™t help but be, Ian thought, even if he was dead, on a day like this.

Heâ€™d risen to his feet, thinking rapidly. Heâ€™d need to get the bugger onto the horse, but maybe best undress him? Take off the telltale coat, at least? But what if he were to take him back toward the British lines, find someone there to take charge of him, get him to a surgeon? That was closer.

Still need to take the coat off, or the man might die of the heat before he got anywhere. So resolved, he knelt again, and thus saved his own life. The tomahawk chunked into the sycamoreâ€™s trunk just where his head had been a moment before.

And, a moment later, one of the Abenaki raced down the slope and leapt on him with a shriek that blasted bad breath into his face. That split second of warning, though, was enough that heâ€™d got his feet under him and pushed to the side, heaving the Abenakiâ€™s body over his hip in a clumsy wrestling throw that landed the man in the mud four feet away.

The second one was behind him; Ian heard the manâ€™s feet in the gravel and weeds and whirled to meet the downward strike, catching the blow on his forearm, grabbing for the knife with his other hand.

He caught itâ€”by the blade, and hissed through his teeth as it cut into his palmâ€”and chopped down on the manâ€™s wrist with his half-numbed arm. The knife jarred loose. Hand and knife were slippery with blood; he couldnâ€™t get hold of the hilt but had got it awayâ€”he turned and threw it as far as he could upstream, and it plunked into the water.

Then they were both on him, punching, kicking, and tearing at him. He staggered backward, lost his balance but not his grip on one of his attackers, and succeeded in falling into the creek with the man atop him. After that, he lost track.

He had one of the Abenaki on his back in the water, was trying earnestly to drown him, while the other rode his own back and tried to get an arm around his neckâ€”and then there was a racket on the other side of the ravine and everything stopped for a moment. A lot of men, moving in a disorganized sort of wayâ€”he could hear drums, but there was a noise like the distant sea, incoherent voices.

The Abenaki stopped, too, just for an instant, but that was long enough: Ian twisted, flinging the man off his back, and bounded awkwardly through the water, slipping and sinking in the muddy bottom, but made it to shore and ran for the first thing that met his eyeâ€”a tall white oak. He flung himself at the trunk and shinned up, grabbing at branches as they came in reach to pull himself higher, faster, reckless of his wounded hand, the rough bark scraping his skin.

The Indians were after him, but too late; one leapt and slapped at his bare foot but failed to get a grip, and he got a knee over a large branch and clung, panting, to the trunk, ten feet up. Safe? He thought so, but after a moment peered down cautiously.

The Abenaki were casting to and fro like wolves, glancing up at the noise above the rim of the ravine, then up at Ianâ€”then across the creek toward William, and that made Ianâ€™s wame curl up. God, what could he do if they should decide to go cut the manâ€™s throat? He hadnâ€™t even got a stone to throw at them.

The one good thing was that neither of them seemed to have either a gun or a bow; must have left those with their horses, up above. They couldnâ€™t do anything but throw stones at him, and they seemed disinclined.

More noise from aboveâ€”a lot of men up there; what were they shouting?â€”and the Abenaki abruptly abandoned Ian. They splashed back across the stream, their leggings clinging with water and streaked with black mud, paused briefly to turn William over and rummage his clothesâ€”evidently heâ€™d already been robbed, for they found nothingâ€”and then untied Ianâ€™s horse and with a last mocking call of â€œMohawk!â€ disappeared with the mare into a growth of pussy willows downstream.





IAN HAD DRAGGED himself one-handed up the slope, crawled some distance, and then lay for a while under a fallen log on the edge of a clearing, spots coming and going before his eyes like a swarm of midgies. There was a lot going on nearby, but none of it near enough to cause him immediate concern. He closed his eyes, hoping that would make the spots go away. They didnâ€™t, instead turning from black to a horrid constellation of swimming pink and yellow blobs that made him want to vomit.

He hastily opened his eyes again, in time to see several powder-blackened Continental soldiers, stripped to their shirts, some bare to the waist, dragging a cannon down the road. They were followed in short order by more men and another cannon, all staggering with the heat and white-eyed with exhaustion. He recognized Colonel Owen, stumping along between the limbers, sooty face set in unhappy desperation.

Some sense of stirring drew Ianâ€™s wandering eye away toward a group of men, and he realized with a faint sense of interest that it was a very large group of men, with a standard hanging limp as an unstuffed haggis against its pole.

That in turn stirred recognition. Sure enough, there was General Lee, long-nosed and frowning but looking very keen, riding out of the mass toward Owen.

Ian was too far away and there was too much noise to hear a word, but the trouble was obvious from Owenâ€™s gestures and pointings. One of his cannon was broken, burst, probably from the heat of firing, and another had broken free of its limber and was being dragged with ropes, its metal scraping on the rocks as it juddered along.

A dim sense of urgency was reasserting itself. William. He needed to tell someone about William. Plainly it wasnâ€™t going to be the British.

Leeâ€™s brows drew in and his lips thinned, but he kept his composure. He had bent down from his saddle to listen to Owen; now he nodded, spoke a few words, and straightened up. Owen wiped a sleeve across his face and waved to his men. They picked up their ropes and leaned into the weight, disconsolate, and Ian saw that three or four were wounded, cloths wrapped round heads or hands, one half-hopping with a bloody leg, a hand on one of the cannon for support.

Ianâ€™s wame had begun to settle now, and he was desperately thirsty, despite having drunk his fill at the creek only a short time before. Heâ€™d taken no notice where he was going but, seeing Owenâ€™s cannon come down the road, knew he must be near the bridge, though it was out of sight. He crawled out of his hiding place and managed to stand up, holding on to the log for a moment while his vision went black and white and black again.

William. He had to find someone to help . . . but first he had to find water. He couldnâ€™t manage without it. Everything heâ€™d drunk at the creek had run off him as sweat, and he was parched to the bone.

It took several tries, but he got water at last from an infantryman who had two canteens hanging round his neck.

â€œWhat happened to you, chum?â€ the infantryman asked, eyeing him with interest.

â€œHad a fight with a British scout,â€ Ian replied, and reluctantly handed back the canteen.

â€œHope you won it, then,â€ the man said, and waved without waiting for an answer, moving off with his company.

Ianâ€™s left eye was stinging badly and his vision was cloudy; a cut in his eyebrow was bleeding. He groped in the small bag at his waist and found the handkerchief wrapped round the smoked ear he carried. The cloth was a small one, but big enough to tie round his brow.

He wiped his knuckles over his mouth, already longing for more water. What ought he to do? He could see the standard now being vigorously waved, flapping heavily in the thick air, summoning the troops to follow. Plainly Lee was headed over the bridge; he knew where he was going, and his troops with him. No one wouldâ€”or couldâ€”stop to climb down a ravine to aid a wounded British soldier.

Ian shook his head experimentally and, finding that his brains didnâ€™t seem to rattle, set off toward the southwest. With luck, heâ€™d meet La Fayette or Uncle Jamie coming up, and maybe get another mount. With a horse, he could get William out of the ravine alone. And whatever else might happen today, heâ€™d settle the hash of those Abenaki bastards.





HIGH NOON

ONE OF LA FAYETTEâ€™S men came up at this point with orders to fall back, to rejoin La Fayetteâ€™s main body near one of the farms between Spotswood South Brook and Spotswood Middlebrook. Jamie was pleased to hear it; there was no reasonable way for half-armed militia companies to lay siege to the artillery entrenched in the orchard, not with rifles guarding the cannon.

â€œGather your companies, Mr. Guthrie, and join me on the road up there,â€ Jamie said, pointing. â€œMr. Bixby, can ye find Captain Kirby? Tell him the same thing; Iâ€™ll fetch along Craddockâ€™s troops.â€

Captain Craddockâ€™s companies had been badly demoralized by his death, and Jamie had brought them under his own direct command to prevent them scattering like bumblebees.

They made their way across the fields, picking up Corporal Filmer and his men at the farmhouseâ€”it was deserted; no need to leave anyone thereâ€”and across the bridge over one of the creeks. He slowed a little as his horseâ€™s hooves thudded on the planks, feeling the blessed cool dampness coming up from the water thirty feet below. They should stop, he thought, for waterâ€” they hadnâ€™t, since early morning, and the canteens would be running dryâ€”but it would take too long for so many men to work their way along the ravine, down to the creek, and back up. He thought they could make it to La Fayetteâ€™s position; there were wells there.

He could see the road ahead and peeled an eye for lurking British. He wondered, with a momentâ€™s irritation, where Ian was; he would have liked to know where the British were.

He found out an instant later. A gunshot cracked nearby, and his horse slipped and fell. Jamie yanked his foot free and rolled out of the saddle as the horse hit the bridge with a thud that shook the whole structure, struggled for an instant, neighing loudly, and slid over the edge into the ravine.

Jamie scrambled to his feet; his hand was burning, all the skin taken off his palm when heâ€™d skidded on the splintered boards.

â€œRun!â€ he shouted, with what breath he had left, and waved an arm wildly, gathering the men, pointing them down the road toward a growth of trees that would cover them. â€œGo!â€

He found himself among them, the surge of men carrying him with them, and they stumbled into cover, gasping and wheezing with the effort of running. Kirby and Guthrie were sorting out their companies, the late Captain Craddockâ€™s men were clustering near Jamie, and he nodded, breathless, to Bixby and Corporal Greenhow to count noses.

He could still hear the sound the horse had made, hitting the ground below the bridge.

He was going to vomit; he felt it rising and knew better than to try to hold it back. He made a quick staying motion toward Lieutenant Schnell, who wanted to speak to him, stepped behind a large pine, and let his stomach turn itself out like an emptied sporran. He stayed bent for a moment, mouth open and forehead pressed against the rough bark for support, letting the gush of saliva wash the taste of it from his mouth.

Cuidich mi, a Dhia . . . But his mind had lost all notion of words for the moment, and he straightened up, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. As he came out from behind the tree, though, all thought of what might be going on and what he might have to do about it vanished. Ian had come out of the trees nearby and was making his way across the open space. The lad was afoot and moving slowly, but doggedly. Jamie could see the bruises, even from a distance of forty feet.

â€œThat one of ourn or one of theirn?â€ a militiaman asked doubtfully, raising his musket to bear on Ian, just in case.

â€œHeâ€™s mine,â€ Jamie said. â€œDonâ€™t shoot him, aye? Ian! Ian!â€ He didnâ€™t runâ€”his left knee hurt too much to runâ€”but made his way toward his nephew as fast as possible and was relieved to see the glassy look in Ianâ€™s eyes shatter and brighten into recognition at sight of him.

â€œUncle Jamie!â€ Ian shook his head as though to clear it and stopped abruptly with a gasp.

â€œAre ye bad hurt, a bhalaich?â€ Jamie asked, stepping back and looking for blood. There was some, but nothing dreadful. The lad wasnâ€™t clutching himself as though wounded in the vitals. . . .



â€œNo. No, itâ€™sâ€”â€ Ian worked his mouth, trying to get up the spit to make words, and Jamie thrust his canteen into Ianâ€™s hand. There was pitifully little water left in it, but some, enough, and Ian gulped it.

â€œWilliam,â€ Ian gasped, lowering the empty canteen. â€œYourâ€”â€

â€œWhat about him?â€ Jamie interrupted. There were more men coming down the road, some of them half-running, looking back. â€œWhat?â€ he repeated, grasping Ianâ€™s arm.

â€œHeâ€™s alive,â€ Ian said at once, correctly gauging both intent and intensity of the question. â€œSomeone hit him on the head and left him in the bottom of yon ravine.â€ He gestured vaguely toward the scouts. â€œMaybe three hundred yards west oâ€™ the bridge, aye? Heâ€™s no dead, but I dinna ken how bad hurt he may be.â€

Jamie nodded, making instant calculations.

â€œAye, and what happened to you?â€ He could only hope that William and Ian hadnâ€™t happened to each other. But if William was unconscious, it couldnâ€™t be he whoâ€™d taken Ianâ€™s horse, and plainly someone had, forâ€”

â€œTwo Abenaki scouts,â€ Ian replied with a grimace. â€œThe buggers have been following me forâ€”â€

Jamie was still holding Ian by the left arm and felt the impact of the arrow and the shock of its reverberation through the ladâ€™s body. Ian glanced unbelievingly at his right shoulder, where the shaft protruded, and gave at the knees, his weight pulling him from Jamieâ€™s grasp as he keeled over.

Jamie launched himself over Ianâ€™s body and hit the ground rolling, avoiding the second arrow; he heard it rip the air near his ear. Heard the militiamanâ€™s gun speak just above him and then a confusion of screaming and shouting, a group of his men breaking, running toward the source of the arrows, bellowing.

â€œIan!â€ He rolled his nephew onto his back. The lad was conscious, but as much of his face as showed under the paint was white and ghastly, his throat working helplessly. Jamie grasped the arrow; it was lodged in what Claire called the deltoid, the fleshy part of the upper arm, but it didnâ€™t budge when he shook it gently.

â€œI think itâ€™s struck the bone,â€ he said to Ian. â€œNo bad, but the tipâ€™s stuck fast.â€

â€œI think so, too,â€ Ian said faintly. He was struggling to sit up, but couldnâ€™t. â€œBreak it off, aye? I canna be going about wiâ€™ it sticking out like that.â€

Jamie nodded, got his nephew sitting unsteadily upright, and broke the shaft between his hands, leaving a ragged stub a few inches long with which to pull the arrow out. There wasnâ€™t much blood, only a trickle running down Ianâ€™s arm. Claire could see to getting the arrowhead out later.

The shouting and confusion were becoming widespread. A glance showed him more men coming down the road, and he heard a fife signaling in the distance, thin and desperate.

â€œDâ€™ye ken whatâ€™s happened up there?â€ he said to Ian, nodding toward the noise. Ian shook his head.

â€œI saw Colonel Owen cominâ€™ down wiâ€™ his cannon all in shambles. He stopped to say a word to Lee and then came on, but he wasna running.â€



A few men were running, though in a heavy, clumsy wayâ€”not as though pursuit was close. But he could feel alarm beginning to spread through the men around him and turned to them at once.

â€œStay by me,â€ he said calmly to Guthrie. â€œKeep your men together, and by me. Mr. Bixbyâ€”say that to Captain Kirby, as well. Stay by me; dinna move save on my word.â€

The men from Craddockâ€™s company who had run after the Abenakiâ€”he supposed that to be the source of the arrowsâ€”had vanished into the woods. He hesitated for an instant, but then sent a small party after them. No Indian heâ€™d ever met would fight from a fixed position, so he doubted he was sending his men into ambush. Perhaps into the face of the oncoming British, but if that was the case, best he knew about it as soon as possible, and at least one or two would likely make it back to tell him.

Ian was getting his feet under him; Jamie bent and gave the lad an arm under his good shoulder and got him standing. His legs shook in their buckskins and sweat ran in sheets down his bare torso, but he stood.

â€œWas it you who called my name, Uncle Jamie?â€ he asked.

â€œAye, I did when I saw ye come out of the trees.â€ Jamie nodded toward the wood, keeping one eye out for anyone coming back that way. â€œWhy?â€

â€œNot then. Just before thisâ€”â€ He touched the ragged end of the arrow shaft gingerly. â€œSomeone called out behind me; thatâ€™s what made me move, and a good thing, too. Iâ€™d haâ€™ taken this square in the chest otherwise.â€

Jamie shook his head and felt that faint sense of bemusement that always attended brushes with ghostsâ€”if thatâ€™s what this was. The only strangeness of it was that it never seemed strange at all.

But there was no time to think of such things; there were calls now of â€œRetreat! Retreat!â€ and the men behind him stirred and rippled like wheat in a rising wind.

â€œStay by me!â€ he said, in a loud, firm voice, and the ones nearest him took a grip of their weapons and stood.

William. Thought of his son sparked a flare of alarm in his bones. The arrow that had struck Ian had jolted the vision of William, sprawled and bloody in the mud, out of his head, but now . . . Christ, he couldnâ€™t send men after the lad, not with half the army pouring back in this direction, and the British maybe on their heels. . . . A sudden ray of hope: if the British were headed this way, theyâ€™d maybe come across the lad and care for him.

He wanted badly to go himself. If William was dying . . . but he could in no circumstances leave his men, and particularly not in these circumstances. A terrible urgency seized him.

Christ, if I never speak to himâ€”never tell himâ€”

Now he saw Lee and his aides coming down the road. They were moving slowly, no air of haste about it, but deliberateâ€”and looking back now and then, almost surreptitiously, glancing quickly again to the front, sitting straight in their saddles.

â€œRetreat!â€ The cry was springing up now all around them, growing stronger, and men were streaming out of the woods. â€œRetreat!â€

â€œStay by me,â€ Jamie said, softly enough that only Bixby and Guthrie heard himâ€”but it was enough. They stiffened, stood by him. Their resolve would help to hold the rest. If Lee came even with him, ordered him . . . then they would have to go. But not â€™til then.

â€œShit!â€ said one of the men behind him, surprised. Jamie glanced back, saw a staring face, then whipped round to look where the man was looking. Some of Craddockâ€™s men were coming out of the wood, looking pleased with themselves. They had Claireâ€™s mare with them, and over her saddle was the limp body of an Indian, his long, greased scalp locks nearly dragging the ground.

â€œGot him, sir!â€ One of the menâ€”Mortlakeâ€”saluted, grinning white-toothed from the shade of a hat that he didnâ€™t think to remove. His face gleamed like oiled leather, and he nodded to Ian in a friendly fashion, jerking his thumb at the mare. â€œHorseâ€”you?â€

â€œIt is,â€ Ian said, and his Scots accent made Mortlake blink. â€œI thank ye, sir. I think my uncle had best take the horse, though. Yeâ€™ll need her, aye?â€ he added to Jamie, lifting an eyebrow toward the ranks of men behind them.

Jamie wanted to refuse; Ian looked as if he could barely walk. But the lad was right. Jamie would have to lead these men, whether forward or backâ€”and heâ€™d need them to be able to see him. He nodded reluctantly, and the body of the Abenaki was dragged from the saddle and tossed carelessly into the brush. He saw Ianâ€™s eyes follow it, dark with dislike, and thought for a split second of the smoked ear his nephew carried in his sporran, and hoped that Ian wouldnâ€™tâ€”but, no, a Mohawk took no trophies from anotherâ€™s kill.

â€œThere were two of them, ye said, Ian?â€

Ian turned from contemplation of the dead Abenaki and nodded.

â€œSaw tâ€™other one,â€ Mortlake answered the implied question. â€œRan when we shot this villain.â€ He coughed, glancing at the increasing streams of men coming down the road. â€œBeg pardon, sir, but oughtnâ€™t we be moving, too?â€

The men were fidgeting, craning their necks to see, murmuring when they spotted Lee, whose aides were spreading out, trying to marshal the swarming men into some kind of orderly retreat but being roundly ignored. Then something, some change of atmosphere, made Jamie turn, and half the men with him.

And here came Washington up the road on Jamieâ€™s erstwhile white stallion, galloping, and a look on his big, rough face that would have melted brass.

The incipient panic in the men dissolved at once as they pressed forward, urgent to learn what was afoot. There was chaos in the road. Some companies scattered, stopping abruptly to look round for their fellows, some noticing Washingtonâ€™s sudden appearance, others still coming down the road, colliding with those standing stillâ€”and, in the midst of it, Washington pulled his horse up beside Charles Leeâ€™s and leaned toward him, flushed like an apple with heat and anger.

â€œWhat do you mean by this, sir?!â€ was all that Jamie heard clearly, the words carried to him by some freak of the heavy air, before noise and dust and smothering heat settled so thickly on the scene that it was impossible to hear anything over the clishmaclaver, save the disquieting echo of musket volleys and the occasional faint popping of grenadoes in the distance.

He didnâ€™t try to shout above the noise; it wasnâ€™t necessary. His men were going nowhere, as riveted to the spectacle before them as he was.

Leeâ€™s long-nosed face was pinched with fury, and Jamie saw him for a brief instant as Punch, the furious puppet in a Punch-and-Judy show. An unhinged urge to laugh bubbled up, as the necessary corollary irresistibly presented itself: George Washington as Judy, the mobcapped shrew who belabored her husband with a stick. For an instant, Jamie feared he had succumbed to the heat and lost his mind.

Once envisioned, though, he couldnâ€™t escape the thought, and for an instant he was standing in Hyde Park, watching Punch feed his baby to the sausage machine.

For that was what Washington was very clearly doing. It lasted no more than three or four minutes, and then Washington made a furious gesture of disgust and dismissal and, wheeling his horse, set off at a trot, circling back to pass the troops who had clotted along the roadside, watching in fascination.

Emerging from his own fascination with a jolt, Jamie put a foot in the mareâ€™s stirrup and swung up.

â€œIanâ€”â€ he said, and his nephew nodded, putting a hand on his kneeâ€”as much to steady himself, he thought, as to reassure his uncle.

â€œGive me a few men, Uncle Jamie,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™ll see to . . . his lordship.â€

There was barely time to summon Corporal Greenhow and detail him to take five men and accompany Ian, before Washington came close enough to spot Jamie and his companies. The generalâ€™s hat was in his hand and his face was afire, anger and desperation subsumed in eagerness, and the whole of his being radiating something Jamie had seldom seen, but recognized. Had felt himself, once. It was the look of a man risking everything, because there was no choice.

â€œMr. Fraser!â€ Washington shouted to him, and his wide mouth stretched wider in a blazing grin. â€œFollow me!â€





PATER NOSTER

WILLIAM CAME AWAKE slowly, feeling terrible. His head hurt and he wanted to vomit. He was horribly thirsty, but the thought of drinking anything made his gorge rise and he retched feebly. He was lying in grass and bugs; there were bugs crawling on him. . . . He saw, for one vivid moment, a line of tiny ants climbing busily through the dark hairs on his wrist and tried to dash his hand against the ground to dislodge them. His hand didnâ€™t move, though, and his consciousness faded.

It came back with a throbbing rush and jounce. The world was jigging dizzily up and down, and he couldnâ€™t breathe. Then he made out the dark things that went in and out of his field of view as being a horseâ€™s legs and realized that he was belly-down over a saddle, being carried somewhere. Where . . . ?

There was a lot of shouting going on nearby, and the noise hurt his head very much.

â€œStop!â€ shouted an English voice. â€œWhat are you doing with him? Stand! Stand or Iâ€™ll kill you!â€

â€œLeave him! Push him off! Run!â€ A vaguely familiar voice, Scottish.

Then a confusion of noise and somewhere in it the Scottish voice again, shouting, â€œTell myâ€”â€ But then he hit the ground with a thud that knocked out both wit and wind, and slid back into darkness, headfirst.



IN THE END, it was simplicity itself. John Grey walked down a cattle track, following the hoofprints toward what must be water, and walked straight into a startled group of British soldiers filling their canteens at a muddy ford. Light-headed from thirst and heat, he didnâ€™t bother trying to identify or explain himself, just put his hands in the air and gave himself up with an intense feeling of relief.

The soldiers gave him water, at least, and then he was marched off under the guard of a nervous boy with a musket and into the yard of a farmhouse that appeared to be deserted. No doubt the owners had fled upon realizing that they were in the middle of twenty thousand or so armed troops bent on mayhem.

Grey was hustled over to a large wagon half filled with cut grass, made to sit down on the ground with several other captured prisonersâ€”in the shade, thank Godâ€”and left there under the guard of two middle-aged privates, armed with muskets, and a nervous child of fourteen or so in a lieutenantâ€™s uniform, who twitched every time the sound of a volley echoed off the trees.

This might be his best chance. If he could shock or intimidate the boy into sending him to Cornwallis or Clinton . . .

â€œSir!â€ he barked at the boy, who blinked at him, startled. So did the captured Americans.

â€œWhat is your name, sir?â€ he demanded, in his command voice. That rattled the young lieutenant badly; he took two involuntary steps backward before stopping himself. He flushed, though, and rallied.

â€œYou be quiet!â€ he said, and, stepping forward, aimed a cuff at Greyâ€™s ear.

Grey caught him by the wrist by reflex, but before he could release the boy, one of the privates had taken a stride toward him and brought down the butt of his musket on Greyâ€™s left forearm.

â€œâ€™E said be quiet,â€ the private said mildly. â€œIâ€™d do it, was I you.â€

Grey was quiet, but only because he couldnâ€™t speak. That arm had been broken twice beforeâ€”once by Jamie Fraser, once by a cannon explosionâ€” and the third time was definitely not the charm. His vision went black for a moment, and everything inside him contracted into a ball of hot lead. Then it started to hurt, and he could breathe again.

â€œWhatâ€™s that you just said?â€ the man sitting next him said under his breath, eyebrows raised. â€œ â€™Tainâ€™t English, is it?â€

â€œNo,â€ said Grey, and paused for another breath, clutching the arm against his belly. â€œItâ€™s German for â€˜Oh, shit.â€™â€

â€œAh.â€ The man nodded understandingly andâ€”with a wary glance at the guardsâ€”brought a small flask out from under his coat and pulled the cork before handing it to Grey. â€œTry that, friend,â€ he whispered.

The scent of overripe apples surged directly into his brain and very nearly made him vomit. He managed to swallow, though, and handed back the flask with a nod of thanks. Sweat ran down his face in streams, stinging his good eye.

No one spoke. The man whoâ€™d given him the applejack was a Continental regular, middle-aged, with a haggard face and only half his teeth remaining. He sat hunched, elbows on his knees, eyes fixed on the distance, where the sound of fighting was. The others were doing the same thing, he realizedâ€”all craning toward the battle.

Colonel Watson Smith popped into his mind, doubtless summoned up by the fumes of applejack, but appearing so suddenly that Grey jerked a little, and one of the guards stiffened, giving him a hard look. Grey looked away, though, and the man relaxed.

Shocked with pain, exhausted and thirsty, he lay down, nursing his throbbing arm against his chest. The buzzing of insects filled his ears, and the volley of muskets retreated into the meaningless rumble of distant thunder. He let himself lapse into a not unpleasant catatonia visualizing Smith shirtless, lying on the narrow cot under a lantern, cradling Grey in his arms, stroking his back with a comforting hand. At some point, he drifted into an uneasy sleep, punctuated by the sounds of guns and shouting.

He woke suddenly, with a mouth like cotton, to find that several more prisoners had been delivered and that there was an Indian sitting beside him. Greyâ€™s working eye was gummy and bleared, and it took a moment before he recognized the face under the remnants of black and green war paint.

Ian Murray gave him a long, level look that said plainly, â€œDonâ€™t talk,â€ and he didnâ€™t. Murray raised an eyebrow at his wounded arm. Grey lifted his good shoulder in a brief shrug and focused his attention on the water cart that had come to a halt on the nearby road.

â€œYou and you, come with me.â€ One of the privates jerked a thumb at two of the prisoners and led them off toward the cart, from which they returned shortly, carrying buckets of water.

The water was blood-warm and tasted of sodden, half-rotted wood, but they drank greedily, spilling it down their clothes in their haste. Grey wiped a wet hand across his face, feeling somewhat more settled in his mind. He flexed his left wrist experimentally; perhaps it was only a bruiâ€”no, it wasnâ€™t.

Heâ€™d drawn in his breath with a hiss, and Murray, as though in response, closed his eyes, steepled his hands together, and began to intone the Pater Noster.



â€œWhat in b-buggery is that?â€ the lieutenant demanded, stamping over to him. â€œAre you talking Indian, sir?â€

Ian opened his eyes, regarding the child with a mild stare.

â€œItâ€™s Latin. Iâ€™m sayinâ€™ my prayers, aye?â€ he said. â€œDâ€™ye mind?â€

â€œDo Iâ€”â€ The lieutenant stopped, baffled as much by being addressed in a Scottish accent as by the circumstance. He stole a glance at the privates, who looked off into the distance. He cleared his throat.

â€œNo,â€ he said shortly, and turned away, pretending absorption in the distant cloud of white powder smoke that hung low over the trees.

Murray cut his eyes at Grey and, with a slight nod, began the Pater Noster again. Grey, somewhat puzzled, joined him, stumbling a bit. The lieutenant stiffened, but didnâ€™t turn round.

â€œDo they not know who you are?â€ Murray asked in Latin at the end of the prayer, not varying his intonation.

â€œI told them; they donâ€™t believe me,â€ Grey replied, adding a random â€œAve Mariaâ€ at the end for verisimilitude.

â€œGratia plena, Dominus tecum. Shall I tell them?â€

â€œI have no idea what comes next. I suppose it couldnâ€™t hurt.â€

â€œBenedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Jesu,â€ Murray replied, and rose to his feet.

The guards swung round immediately, raising their muskets to their shoulders. Murray ignored this, addressing the lieutenant.

â€œItâ€™s maybe no my business, sir,â€ he said mildly. â€œBut I shouldna like to see ye ruin your career over a wee mistake.â€

â€œBe quiâ€”what mistake?â€ the lieutenant demanded. He had taken off his wig because of the heat but now crammed it back on his head, evidently thinking it might lend him authority. He was mistaken in this impression, as the wig was a good deal too large and immediately slipped sideways over one ear.

â€œThis gentleman,â€ Murray said, gesturing to Grey, who sat up straight and stared impassively at the lieutenant. â€œI canna imagine whatâ€™s brought him here or why he should be dressed as he isâ€”but I ken him well. This is Lord John Grey. The, ehm, brother of Colonel Grey, the Duke of Pardloe?â€ he added delicately.

The hue of the young lieutenantâ€™s face changed noticeably. He glanced quickly back and forth between Murray and Grey, frowning, and absently shoved his wig back into place. Grey rose slowly, keeping an eye on the guards.

â€œThatâ€™s ridiculous,â€ the lieutenant said, but without force. â€œWhy should Lord John Grey be here, looking likeâ€”like that?â€

â€œThe exigencies of war, Lieutenant,â€ said Grey, keeping his voice level. â€œI see you belong to the Forty-ninth, which means that your colonel is Sir Henry Calder. I know him. If you will be so kind as to lend me paper and pencil, I will write him a short note, asking him to send an escort to fetch me. You can send the note via the water carrier,â€ he added, seeing a wild look come into the boyâ€™s eyes, and hoping to calm him before he panicked and decided that the simplest way out of this imbroglio was to shoot Grey.

One of the privatesâ€”the one who had broken Greyâ€™s armâ€”coughed gently.



â€œWeâ€™m goinâ€™ to need more men, sir, in any case. Three of us with a dozen prisoners . . . and doubtless more cominâ€™?â€ The lieutenant looked blank, and the private had another go. â€œI meantersay . . . might be youâ€™d mean to send for reinforcements anyroad.â€ The man caught Greyâ€™s eye and coughed again.

â€œAccidents happen,â€ Grey said, though with no great charity, and the guards relaxed.

â€œAll right,â€ the lieutenant said. His voice broke on it and he repeated, â€œAll right!â€ in a gruff baritone, looking belligerently around. No one was foolish enough to laugh.

Greyâ€™s knees were wanting to tremble, and he sat down rather abruptly to prevent it. Murrayâ€™s faceâ€”well, the faces of all the prisonersâ€”were carefully blank.

â€œTibi debeo,â€ Grey said quietly. I acknowledge the debt.

â€œDeo gratias,â€ Murray murmured, and only then did Grey see the trail of blood that streaked Murrayâ€™s arm and side, staining his breechcloutâ€”and the stub of a broken arrow protruding from the flesh of his right shoulder.



WILLIAM CAME round again lying on something that didnâ€™t move, thank God. There was a canteen being pressed to his lips, and he drank, gulping, lips reaching for more water even as it was drawn away.

â€œNot that fast, youâ€™ll be sick,â€ said a familiar voice. â€œBreathe once, and you can have more.â€ He breathed and forced his eyes open against a glare of light. A familiar face appeared over him, and he reached up a wavering hand toward it.

â€œPapa . . .â€ he whispered.

â€œNo, but the next best thing,â€ said his uncle Hal, taking a firm hold on the groping hand and sitting down beside him. â€œHowâ€™s the head?â€

William closed his eyes and tried to focus on something other than the pain.

â€œNot . . . that bad.â€

â€œPull the other one, itâ€™s got bells on,â€ his uncle murmured, cupping Williamâ€™s cheek and turning his head to the side. â€œLetâ€™s have a look.â€

â€œLetâ€™s have more water,â€ William managed, and his uncle gave a small snort and put the canteen back to Williamâ€™s lips.

When William stopped to breathe again, his uncle set the canteen down and inquired, in a perfectly normal tone of voice, â€œCan you sing, do you think?â€

His vision was going in and out; there were momentarily two of his uncle, then one, then two again. He closed one eye, and Uncle Hal steadied.

â€œYou want me to . . . sing?â€ he managed.

â€œWell, perhaps not right this minute,â€ the duke said. He sat back on his stool and began to whistle a tune. â€œRecognize that, do you?â€ he asked, breaking off.

â€œâ€™Lillibulero,â€™â€ William said, beginning to feel rather cross. â€œWhy, for Godâ€™s sake?â€

â€œKnew a chap once who was hit on the head with an ax and lost his ability to make out music. Couldnâ€™t tell one note from another.â€ Hal leaned forward, holding up two fingers. â€œHow many fingers am I holding up?â€

â€œTwo. Stick them up your nose,â€ William advised him. â€œGo away, will you? Iâ€™m going to be sick.â€

â€œTold you not to drink too fast.â€ But his uncle had a basin under his face and a strong hand on his head, bracing him while he heaved and coughed and shot water out of his nose.

By the time he had subsided back onto his pillowâ€”it was a pillow, he was lying on a camp cotâ€”heâ€™d recovered enough of his senses to be able to look around and determine that he was in an army tentâ€”probably his uncleâ€™s, judging from the battered campaign chest and the sword that lay across itâ€”and the glare of light was coming from the low afternoon sun flooding in through the open tent flap.

â€œWhat happened?â€ he asked, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.

â€œWhatâ€™s the last thing you recall?â€ Uncle Hal countered, handing him the canteen.

â€œTheâ€”erâ€”â€ His mind was full of confused bits and pieces. The last thing he truly remembered was Jane and her sister, laughing at him as he stood bare-arsed in the creek. He sipped water and put cautious fingers to his head, which seemed to be wrapped in a bandage. It felt sore to the touch. â€œTaking my horse down to drink at a creek.â€

Uncle Hal raised one eyebrow. â€œYou were found in a ditch, near a place called Spottiswood or some such thing. Von Knyphausenâ€™s troops were holding a bridge there.â€

William started to shake his head, but thought better of it and closed his eyes against the light.

â€œDonâ€™t remember.â€

â€œIt will likely come back to you.â€ His uncle paused. â€œDo you happen to remember where you last saw your father?â€

William felt an unnatural calm come over him. He just bloody didnâ€™t care anymore, he told himself. The whole world was going to know, one way or another.

â€œWhich one?â€ he said flatly, and opened his eyes. His uncle was regarding him with interest, but no particular surprise.

â€œYouâ€™ve met Colonel Fraser, then?â€ Hal asked.

â€œI have,â€ William said shortly. â€œHow long have you known about it?â€

â€œRoughly three seconds, in the sense of certainty,â€ his uncle replied. He reached up and unfastened the leather stock around his neck, sighing with relief as it came off. â€œGood Lord, itâ€™s hot.â€ The stock had left a broad red mark; he massaged this gently, half-closing his eyes. â€œIn the sense of thinking there was something rather remarkable in your resemblance to the aforesaid Colonel Fraser . . . since I met him again in Philadelphia recently. Prior to that, I hadnâ€™t seen him for a long timeâ€”not since you were very small, and I never saw him in close conjunction with you then, in any case.â€

â€œOh.â€

They sat in silence for a bit, gnats and black flies caroming off the canvas and falling onto Williamâ€™s bed like snowflakes. He became aware of the noises of a large camp surrounding them, and it occurred to him that they must be with General Clinton.

â€œI didnâ€™t know you were with Sir Henry,â€ he said at last, breaking the silence. Hal nodded, pulling his worn silver flask out of his coat pocket before tossing the coat itself over the campaign chest.

â€œI wasnâ€™t; Iâ€™ve been with Cornwallis. Weâ€”the regiment, that isâ€”arrived in New York about two weeks ago. I came down to Philadelphia to see Henry and John and make inquiries about Benjamin. I arrived just in time to leave the city with the army.â€

â€œBen? Whatâ€™s he done that youâ€™re inquiring about?â€

â€œGot married, had a son, and been mug enough to be captured by the Rebels, evidently,â€ his uncle replied lightly. â€œThought he might do with a bit of help. If I give you a sip of this, can you keep it down?â€

William didnâ€™t reply, but reached for the flask. It was filled with good brandy; he breathed it in cautiously, but it seemed not to trouble his wobbly stomach, and he risked a sip.

Uncle Hal watched him for a bit, not speaking. The resemblance between him and Lord John was considerable, and it gave William an odd feeling to see himâ€”something between comfort and resentment.

â€œYour father,â€ Hal said after a few moments. â€œOr my brother, if you prefer. Do you recall when you saw him last?â€

Resentment sparked abruptly into anger.

â€œYes, I bloody do. On the morning of the sixteenth. In his house. With my other father.â€

Hal made a low humming noise, indicating interest.

â€œThat when you found out, was it?â€

â€œIt was.â€

â€œDid John tell you?â€

â€œNo, he bloody didnâ€™t!â€ Blood surged to Williamâ€™s face, making his head throb with a fierce suddenness that made him dizzy. â€œIf I hadnâ€™t come face-to-face with theâ€”the fellow, I donâ€™t suppose heâ€™d ever have told me!â€

He swayed and put out a hand to keep from falling over. Hal grabbed him by the shoulders and eased him back down onto the pillow, where he lay still, teeth clenched, waiting for the pain to ebb. His uncle took the flask from his unresisting hand, sat down again, and took a meditative sip.

â€œYou might have done worse,â€ his uncle observed after a moment. â€œIn the way of sires, I mean.â€

â€œOh, really?â€ William said coldly.

â€œGranted, he is a Scot,â€ the duke said judiciously.

â€œAnd a traitor.â€

â€œAnd a traitor,â€ Hal agreed. â€œDamned fine swordsman, though. Knows his horses.â€

â€œHe was a fucking groom, for Godâ€™s sake! Of course he knows horses!â€ Fresh outrage made William jerk upright again, despite the thunder in his temples. â€œWhat am I bloody going to do?!â€

His uncle sighed deeply and put the cork back in the flask.

â€œAdvice? Youâ€™re too old to be given it and too young to take it.â€ He glanced aside at William, his face very like Papaâ€™s. Thinner, older, dark brows beginning to beetle, but with that same rueful humor in the corners of his eyes. â€œThought of blowing your brains out?â€

William blinked, startled.

â€œNo.â€

â€œThatâ€™s good. Anything else is bound to be an improvement, isnâ€™t it?â€ He rose, stretching, and groaned with the movement. â€œGod, Iâ€™m old. Lie down, William, and go to sleep. Youâ€™re in no condition to think.â€ He opened the lantern and blew it out, plunging the tent into warm gloom.

A rustling as he raised the tent flap, and the searing light of the sinking sun outlined the dukeâ€™s slender figure as he turned.

â€œYou are still my nephew,â€ he said in a conversational tone. â€œDoubt thatâ€™s much comfort to you, but there it is.â€





AMONG THE TOMBSTONES

THE SUN WAS LOW and shining directly into my eyes, but the casualties had come so fast that I couldnâ€™t take time to move my equipment round. Theyâ€™d fought all day; it was still going onâ€”I could hear it, close by, but saw nothing when I glanced up, blinking against the sun. Still, the shouts and banging of muskets and what I thought must be grenadesâ€”Iâ€™d never heard a grenade explode, but something was making a sort of irregular hollow poong! that was quite different from the boom of cannon or the slow percussion of musket fireâ€”were loud enough to drown the sounds of groaning and crying from the shade trees and the relentless buzzing of the flies.

I was swaying with weariness and heat and, for my own part, was nearly indifferent to the battle. Until, that is, a young man in militia brown staggered in, blood streaming down his face from a deep cut in his forehead. I had stanched the bleeding and half-wiped his face before I recognized him.

â€œCorporal . . . Greenhow?â€ I asked dubiously, and a small spurt of fear penetrated the fog of fatigue. Joshua Greenhow was in one of Jamieâ€™s companies; Iâ€™d met him.

â€œYes, maâ€™am.â€ He tried to bob his head, but I stopped him, pressing firmly on the wad of lint Iâ€™d slapped on his forehead.

â€œDonâ€™t move. General Fraserâ€”have you . . .â€ My mouth dried, sticky, and I reached automatically for my cup, only to find it empty.

â€œHeâ€™s all right, maâ€™am,â€ the corporal assured me, and reached out a long arm to the table, where my canteen lay. â€œOr at least he was last time I saw him, and that was no more â€™n ten minutes gone.â€ He poured water into my cup, tossed it into his own mouth, breathed heavily for an instant in relief, then poured more, which he handed to me.

â€œThank you.â€ I gulped it; it was so warm that it was barely discernible as wet, but it eased my tongue. â€œHis nephewâ€”Ian Murray?â€

Corporal Greenhow started to shake his head, but stopped.

â€œHavenâ€™t seen him since about noon, but I havenâ€™t seen him dead, either, maâ€™am. Ohâ€”sorry, maâ€™am. I meantâ€”â€

â€œI know what you meant. Here, put your hand there and keep the pressure on.â€ I placed his hand on the lint and fished a fresh suture needle threaded with silk out of its jar of alcohol. My hands, steady all day, trembled a little, and I had to stop and breathe for a moment. Close. Jamie was so close. And somewhere in the midst of the fighting I could hear.

Corporal Greenhow was telling me something about the fighting, but I was having trouble attending. Something about General Lee being relieved of his command andâ€”

â€œRelieved of command?â€ I blurted. â€œWhat the devil for?â€

He looked startled by my vehemence, but replied obligingly.

â€œWhy, I donâ€™t quite know, maâ€™am. Was something to do with a retreat and how he oughtnâ€™t to have told them to do it, but then General Washington come up on his horse and cursed and swore like the dickensâ€”saving your presence, maâ€™am,â€ he added politely. â€œAnyway, I saw him! General Washington. Oh, maâ€™am, it was so . . .â€ Words failed him, and I handed him the canteen with my momentarily free hand.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,â€ I murmured under my breath. Were the Americans winning? Holding their own? Had bloody Charles Lee cocked things up after allâ€”or not?

Corporal Greenhow luckily hadnâ€™t noticed my language, but was coming to life like a flower in the rain, enthused by his account.

â€œAnd so we rushed straight after him, and he was all along the road and the ridgeline, shouting and waving his hat, and all the troops trudging back down . . . why, they all looked up with their eyes staring out of their heads and then they turned round and fell in with us, and the whole army, we justâ€”we just threw ourselves on the damned redcoats. . . . Oh, maâ€™am, it was just wonderful!â€

â€œWonderful!â€ I echoed dutifully, catching a trickle of blood that threatened to run into his eye. The shadows of the tombstones in the graveyard stretched out long and violet, and the sound of the flies buzzed in my ears, louder than the ringing of the shots that still cameâ€”were coming closerâ€”to the frail barrier of the dead. And Jamie with them.

Lord, keep him safe! I prayed in the silence of my heart.

â€œDid you say something, maâ€™am?â€



JAMIE RUBBED a blood-wet sleeve across his face, the wool rasping his skin, sweat burning in his eyes. It was a church theyâ€™d chased the British intoâ€”or a churchyard. Men were dodging through the tombstones, vaulting them in hot pursuit.

The British had turned at bay, though, an officer shouting them into a ragged line, and the drill began, the muskets grounded, ramrods drawn . . .

â€œFire!â€ Jamie bellowed, with all the power left in his cracked voice. â€œFire on them! Now!â€

Only a few men had loaded weapons, but sometimes it took only one. A shot rang out from behind him, and the British officer who was shouting stopped shouting and staggered. He clutched himself, curling up and falling to his knees, and someone shot him again. He jerked backward, then fell over sideways.

There was a roar from the British line, which dissolved at once into a rush, some men pausing long enough to fix their bayonets, others wielding their guns like clubs. The Americans met them, mindless and shrieking, with guns and fists. One militiaman reached the fallen officer, seized him by the legs, and began to drag him away toward the church, perhaps with the notion to take him prisoner, perhaps to get him help. . . .

A British soldier threw himself upon the American, who stumbled backward and fell, loosing his hold on the officer. Jamie was running, shouting, trying to gather the men, but it was no use; theyâ€™d lost their wits altogether in the madness of fighting, and whatever their original intent in seizing the British officer, theyâ€™d lost that, too.

Leaderless, so had the British soldiers, some of whom were now engaged in a grotesque tug-of-war with two Americans, each grasping the limbs of the deadâ€”for surely he must be now, if he hadnâ€™t been killed outrightâ€”British officer.

Appalled, Jamie ran in among them, shouting, but his voice failed altogether under strain and breathlessness, and he realized he was making no more than faint cawing noises. He reached the fight, grasped one soldier by the shoulder, meaning to pull him back, but the man rounded on him and punched him in the face.

It was a glancing blow off the side of his jaw but made him lose his grip, and he was knocked off-balance by someone shoving past him to grab some part of the hapless officerâ€™s body.

Drums. A drum. Someone in the distance was beating something urgent, a summons.

â€œRetreat!â€ someone shouted in a hoarse voice. â€œRetreat!â€

Something happened; a momentary pauseâ€”and suddenly it was all different and the Americans were coming past him, hasty but no longer frantic, a few of them carrying the dead British officer. Yes, definitely dead; the manâ€™s head lolled like a rag dollâ€™s.

Thank God theyâ€™re not dragging him through the dirt was all he had time to think. Lieutenant Bixby was at his shoulder, blood pouring down his face from an open flap of scalp.

â€œThere you are, sir!â€ he said, relieved. â€œThought you was taken, we did.â€ He took Jamie respectfully by the arm, tugging him along. â€œCome away, sir, will you? I donâ€™t trust those wicked buggers not to come back.â€

Jamie glanced in the direction Bixby was pointing. Sure enough, the British were retiring, under the direction of a couple of officers who had come forward out of a mass of redcoats forming up in the middle distance. They showed no disposition to come closer, but Bixby was right: there were still random shots being fired, from both sides. He nodded, fumbling in his pocket for his extra kerchief to give the man to stanch his wound.

The thought of wounds made him think of Claire, and he recalled suddenly what Denzell Hunter had said: â€œTennent Church, the hospitalâ€™s set up there.â€ Was this Tennent Church?

He was already following Bixby toward the road but glanced back. Yes, the men who had the dead British officer were taking him into the church, and there were wounded men sitting near the door, more of them near a small whiteâ€”God, that was Claireâ€™s tent, was sheâ€”

He saw her at once, as though his thought had conjured her, right there in the open. She was standing up, staring openmouthed, and no wonderâ€”there was a Continental regular on a stool beside her, holding a bloodstained cloth, and more such cloths in a basin at her feet. But why was she out here? Sheâ€”

And then he saw her jerk upright, clap a hand to her side, and fall.



A SLEDGEHAMMER hit me in the side, making me jerk, the needle dropping from my hands. I didnâ€™t feel myself fall but was lying on the ground, black and white spots flashing round me, a sense of intense numbness radiating from my right side. I smelled damp earth and warm grass and sycamore leaves, pungent and comforting.

Shock, I thought dimly, and opened my mouth, but nothing but a dry click came out of my throat. What . . . The numbness of the impact began to lessen, and I realized that I had curled into a ball, my forearm pressed by reflex over my abdomen. I smelled burning, and fresh blood, very fresh. Iâ€™ve been shot, then.

â€œSassenach!â€ I heard Jamieâ€™s bellow over the roaring in my ears. He sounded far off, but I heard the terror in his voice clearly. I wasnâ€™t disturbed by it. I felt very calm.

â€œSassenach!â€ The spots had coalesced. I was looking down a narrow tunnel of light and spinning shadow. At the end of it was the shocked face of Corporal Greenhow, the needle dangling by its thread from the half-sewn gash in his forehead.





PART FIVE



Counting Noses





EVEN PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN DONâ€™T WANT TO DIE TO GET THERE

I SWAM DIZZILY TO the surface of consciousness, thinking, What was it Ernest Hemingway had said, about how one is supposed to pass out from the pain but you donâ€™t? I just had, but he was more or less right; the unconsciousness hadnâ€™t lasted more than a few seconds. I was curled into a tight ball, both hands pressed against my right side, and I could feel the blood welling between my fingers, hot and cold and sticky, and it was beginning to hurt . . . very much . . .

â€œSassenach! Claire!â€ I swam out of the fog again and managed to open one eye. Jamie was kneeling by me. He was touching me, had his hands on me, but I couldnâ€™t feel it. . . .

Sweat or blood or something ran burning into my eyes. I could hear someone gaspingâ€”short, shallow, panting breaths. Me, or Jamie? I was cold. I shouldnâ€™t be cold, it was hot as blazes today. . . . I felt jellied, quivering. And it hurt. A lot.

â€œSassenach!â€

Hands turned me. I screamed. Tried to. I felt it wrench my throat but couldnâ€™t hear it; there was a roaring in my ears. Shock, I thought. I couldnâ€™t feel my limbs, my feet. I felt the blood leaving my body.

It hurt.

The shockâ€™s wearing off, I thought. Or is it getting worse? I could see the pain now, going off in bursts like black lightning, jagged and searing.

â€œSassenach!â€

â€œWhat?â€ I said through clenched teeth. â€œAuh!â€

â€œAre ye dying?â€

â€œProbably.â€

Gutshot. The word formed unpleasantly in my mind, and I hoped vaguely that I hadnâ€™t spoken it out loud. Even if I had, though . . . surely Jamie could see the wound . . .

Someone was trying to pull my hands away, and I struggled to keep them in place, keep pressing, but my arms had no strength and I saw one hand hanging limp as they lifted it, the nails outlined black with blood, fingers coated scarlet, dripping. Someone rolled me onto my back and I thought I screamed again.



It hurt unspeakably. Jellied. Impact shock. Cells blasted to shreds and goo. No function . . . organ failure.

Tightness. Couldnâ€™t breathe. Jerking, and someone cursing above me. My eyes were open, I saw color, but the air was thick with pulsing spots.

Shouting. Talk.

I couldnâ€™t draw breath. Something tight around my middle. Whatâ€™s gone? How much?

God, it hurt. Oh, God.



JAMIE COULDNâ€™T take his eyes off Claireâ€™s face, lest she die in the second when he looked away. He fumbled for a kerchief, but heâ€™d given it to Bixby, and in desperation seized a fold of her skirt and pressed it hard to her side. She made a horrible sound and he nearly let go, but the ground under her was already darkening with blood and he pressed harder, shouting, â€œHelp! Help me, Rachel! Dottie!â€

But no one came, and when he risked a split secondâ€™s glance around, he saw nothing but clumps of wounded and dead under the trees some distance away and the flickering forms of soldiers, some running, some wandering dazed through the tombstones. If the girls had been nearby, they must have been forced to run when the skirmish rolled through the graveyard.

He felt the slow tickle of Claireâ€™s blood running over the back of his hand and shouted again, his dry throat tearing with the effort. Someone must hear.

Someone did. He heard running footsteps on the gravel and saw a doctor named Leckie whom he knew racing toward him, white-faced, hurdling a tombstone as he came.

â€œShot?â€ Leckie asked, breathless, collapsing onto his knees beside Jamie. Jamie couldnâ€™t speak, but nodded. Sweat was running down his face and the crease of his spine, but his hands seemed frozen to her body; he couldnâ€™t pull them away, couldnâ€™t let go until Leckie, pawing in one of Claireâ€™s baskets, seized a wad of lint and jerked Jamieâ€™s hand out of the way in order to clap it in place.

The surgeon elbowed him ruthlessly aside and he scuttled crabwise a foot or two away, then rose to his feet, swaying helplessly. Jamie couldnâ€™t look away but became slowly aware that a knot of soldiers had gathered, appalled, shuffling among themselves, not knowing what to do. Jamie gulped air, seized the nearest of these, and sent him running to the church in search of Dr. Hunter. Sheâ€™d want Denny. If she survived long enough for him to comeâ€”

â€œSir! General Fraser!â€ Not even the shouting of his own name made him look away from the spectacle on the ground: the blood, so much of it, soaking her clothes, making a hideous dark red puddle that stained the knees of Leckieâ€™s breeches as he knelt over her; her hair, untied and spilling wild, full of grass and bits of leaf from the ground she lay on, her faceâ€”oh, Christ, her face.

â€œSir!â€ Someone grabbed his arm to compel his attention. He drove his elbow hard into whoever it was, and the man grunted in surprise and let go.



A gabble of whispers, agitation, people telling the newcomer that it was the generalâ€™s wife, hurt, shot, dead or dying . . .

â€œSheâ€™s not dying!â€ he turned and bellowed at them. He thought dimly that he must look demented; their blackened faces were aghast. Bixby stepped out and touched his shoulder gingerly, as though he were a lighted grenade that might go off in the next second. He thought he might.

â€œCan I help, sir?â€ Bixby said quietly.

â€œNo,â€ he managed to say. â€œIâ€”heâ€”â€ He gestured to Leckie, busy on the ground.

â€œGeneral,â€ said the newcomer, at his other elbow. He turned to find a blue-clad regular, a very young man in a baggy lieutenantâ€™s uniform, face set in dogged earnestness. â€œI dislike to intrude, sir, but as your wifeâ€™s not dyingâ€”â€

â€œGo away!â€

The lieutenant flinched, but stood his ground.

â€œSir,â€ he said stubbornly. â€œGeneral Lee has sent me urgently to find you. He requires that you attend him at once.â€

â€œBugger Lee,â€ said Bixby, very rudely, saving Jamie the trouble, and advanced on the newcomer, fists clenched.

The lieutenant was already flushed with heat, but at this grew redder. He ignored Bixby, though, attention focused on Jamie.

â€œYou must come, sir.â€



VOICES . . . I heard words, disjointed, coming out of the fog like bullets, striking randomly.

â€œ. . . find Denzell Hunter!â€

â€œGeneralâ€”â€

â€œNo!â€

â€œâ€”but youâ€™re needed atâ€”â€

â€œNo!â€

â€œâ€”ordersâ€”â€

â€œNO!â€

And another voice, this one stiff with fear.

â€œ. . . could be shot for treason and desertion, sir!â€

That focused my wandering attention and I heard the reply, clearly.

â€œThen theyâ€™ll shoot me where I stand, sir, for I will not leave her side!â€

Good, I thought, and, comforted, lapsed into the spinning void again.



â€œTAKE OFF YOUR coat and waistcoat, lad,â€ Jamie said abruptly. The boy looked completely bewildered, butâ€”stimulated by a menacing movement from Bixbyâ€”did as he was told. Jamie took him by the shoulder, turned him round, and said, â€œStand still, aye?â€

Stooping swiftly, he scooped a handful from the horrifying puddle of bloody mud and, standing, wrote carefully on the messengerâ€™s white back with a finger:



I resign my commission. J. Fraser.

He made to fling the remnants of mud away but, after a momentâ€™s hesitation, added a smeared and reluctant Sir at the top of the message, then clapped the boy on the shoulder.

â€œGo and show that to General Lee,â€ he said. The lieutenant went pale.

â€œThe generalâ€™s in a horrid passion, sir,â€ he said. â€œI dassenâ€™t!â€

Jamie looked at him. The boy swallowed, said, â€œYes, sir,â€ shrugged on his garments, and went at a run, unbuttoned and flapping.

Rubbing his hands heedlessly on his breeches, Jamie knelt again beside Dr. Leckie, who spared him a quick nod. The doctor was pressing a wad of lint and a handful of skirt hard against Claireâ€™s side with both hands. The surgeonâ€™s hands were red to the elbow, and sweat was running down his face, dripping from his chin.

â€œSassenach,â€ Jamie said softly, afraid to touch her. His own clothes were sodden with sweat, but he was cold to the core. â€œCan ye hear me, lass?â€

Sheâ€™d regained consciousness, and his heart rose into his throat. Her eyes were closed, shut tight in a furious grimace of pain and concentration. She did hear him; the golden eyes opened and fixed on him. She didnâ€™t speak; her breath hissed through clenched teeth. She did see him, though, he was sure of thatâ€”and her eyes werenâ€™t clouded with shock, nor dim with imminent death. Not yet.

Dr. Leckie was looking at her face, too, intent. He let out his own breath, and the tension in his shoulders eased a little, though he didnâ€™t relax the pressure of his hands.

â€œCan you get me more lint, a wad of bandage, anything?â€ he asked. â€œI think the bleeding is slowing.â€

Claireâ€™s bag lay open a little way behind Leckie. Jamie lunged for it, upended it on the ground, and snatched up a double handful of rolled bandages from the litter. Leckieâ€™s hand made a sucking sound as he pulled it away from the sopping wad of cloth and grabbed the fresh bandages.

â€œYou might cut her laces,â€ the doctor said calmly. â€œI need her stays off. And it will help her to breathe more easily.â€

Jamie fumbled his dirk free, hands shaking in his haste.

â€œUn . . . tie . . . them!â€ Claire grunted, scowling ferociously.

Jamie grinned absurdly at hearing her voice, and his hands steadied. So she thought sheâ€™d live to need her laces. He gulped air and set himself to undo the knot. Her stay laces were leather and as usual soaked with sweatâ€”but she used a very simple granny knot, and he got it loose with the tip of his dirk.

The knot fell free and he jerked the laces loose, wrenching the stays wide apart. Her bosom rose white as she gasped, and he felt an instantâ€™s embarrassment as he saw her nipples stiffen through the sweat-soaked fabric of her shift. He wanted to cover her.

There were flies everywhere, black and buzzing, drawn by the blood. Leckie shook his head to dislodge one that lighted on his eyebrow. They were swarming round Jamieâ€™s own ears, but he didnâ€™t bother about them, instead brushing them away as they crawled on Claireâ€™s body, over her twitching, pallid face, her hands half curled and helpless.

â€œHere,â€ Leckie said, and, seizing one of Jamieâ€™s hands, pushed it down on the fresh compress. â€œPress hard on that.â€ He sat back on his heels, grabbed another bandage roll, and unfurled it. With some lifting and grunting and a terrible moan from Claire, together they contrived to pass the cingulum round her body, securing the dressing in place.

â€œRight.â€ Leckie swayed for a moment, then got laboriously to his feet. â€œThe bleedingâ€™s mostly stoppedâ€”for now,â€ he said to Jamie. â€œIâ€™ll come back when I can.â€ He swallowed and looked directly at Claireâ€™s face, wiping his chin on his sleeve. â€œGood luck to you, maâ€™am.â€

And with that, he simply strode off toward the open doors of the church, not looking back. Jamie felt such a rush of fury that he would have gone after the man and dragged him back, could he have left Claireâ€™s side. Heâ€™d leftâ€”just left her, the bastard! Alone, helpless!

â€œMay the devil eat your soul and salt it well first, you whore!â€ he shouted in GÃ idhlig after the vanished surgeon. Overcome by fright and the sheer rage of helplessness, he dropped to his knees beside his wife and pounded a fist blindly on the ground.

â€œDid you just . . . call him a . . . whore?â€ The whispered words made him open his eyes.

â€œSassenach!â€ He was scrambling for his discarded canteen, lost in the rubble of stuff from her bag. â€œHere, let me get ye water.â€

â€œNo. Not . . . yet.â€ She managed to raise one hand halfway, and he stopped dead, canteen in hand.

â€œWhy not?â€ She was the gray of rotted oats and slick with sweat, trembling like a leaf. He could see her lips beginning to crack in the heat, for Godâ€™s sake.

â€œI donâ€™t . . . know.â€ She worked her mouth a moment before finding the next words. â€œDonâ€™t . . . know where it is.â€ The trembling hand touched the dressingâ€”already showing a stain of blood seeping through. â€œIf itâ€™s perf . . . perfâ€™rated the . . . bowel. Drink would . . . kill me. Fast. Intestinâ€™l . . . sh-sh-shock.â€

He sat down by her slowly and, closing his eyes, breathed deliberately for a few seconds. For the moment, everything had disappeared: the church, the battle, the screams and shouts and the rumble of limber wheels along the rutted road through Freehold. There wasnâ€™t anything but her and him, and he opened his eyes to look on her face, to fix it in his mind forever.

â€œAye,â€ he said, keeping his voice as steady as he could. â€œAnd if thatâ€™s the case . . . and if it didna kill ye quick . . . Iâ€™ve seen men die gutshot. Balnain died that way. Itâ€™s long and itâ€™s foul, and I willna have ye die like that, Claire. I wonâ€™t!â€

He meant it, truly he did. But his hand squeezed the canteen hard enough to dent the tin. How could he give her the water that might kill her right before his eyes, right . . . now?

Not now, he prayed. Please, donâ€™t let it be now!

â€œIâ€™m not . . . keen . . . either way,â€ she whispered, after a long pause. She blinked away a green-bellied fly, shining like emerald, that had come to drink her tears. â€œI need . . . Denny.â€ A soft gasp. â€œQuick.â€

â€œHeâ€™s coming.â€ He could barely breathe, and his hands hovered over her, afraid to touch anything. â€œDennyâ€™s coming. Hold on!â€

The answer to this was a tiny gruntâ€”her eyes were squinched shut and her jaw set hardâ€”but sheâ€™d heard him, at least. With the vague recollection that she always said you must cover folk suffering from shock and lift their feet, he took off his coat and put it over her, then took off his waistcoat, rolled it up, and shoved it under her feet. At least the coat covered the blood that had now soaked the whole side of her dress. It terrified him to see that.

Her fists were clenched, both driven hard into her wounded side; he couldnâ€™t hold her hand. He put a hand on her shoulder, so sheâ€™d know he was there, shut his eyes, and prayed with his whole being.





SUNDOWN

THE SUN WAS NEARLY down, and Denzell Hunter was laying out his knives. The air was thick with the sweetness of corn liquor; heâ€™d dipped his instruments in it, and they lay gleaming wetly on the clean napkin Mrs. Macken had put down on the sideboard.

Young Mrs. Macken herself was hovering in the doorway, a hand pressed over her mouth and her eyes big as a cowâ€™s. Jamie tried to give her a reassuring smile, but whatever his expression was, it wasnâ€™t a smile and appeared to alarm her further, for she retreated into the darkness of her pantry.

Sheâ€™d likely been alarmed all day, like everyone else in the village of Freehold; she was heavily pregnant and her husband was fighting with the Continentals. And still more alarmed for the last hour, ever since Jamie had pounded on her door. Heâ€™d battered six doors before hers. She was the first to answer, and, in poor return for her hospitality, now found a badly injured woman lying on her kitchen table, oozing blood like a fresh-killed deer.

That image unnerved him still furtherâ€”Mrs. Macken was not the only one in the house who was shaken by eventsâ€”and he came close and took Claireâ€™s hand, as much to reassure himself as her.

â€œHow is it, Sassenach?â€ he said, low-voiced.

â€œBloody awful,â€ she replied hoarsely, and bit her lip to keep from saying more.

â€œHad ye best have a wee nip?â€ He moved to pick up the bottle of rough corn liquor from the sideboard, but she shook her head.

â€œNot quite yet. I donâ€™t think it struck the bowelâ€”but Iâ€™d rather die of blood loss than sepsis or shock, if Iâ€™m wrong.â€

He squeezed her hand. It was cold, and he hoped she would keep talking, though at the same time he knew he ought not to make her talk. Sheâ€™d need all her strength. He tried as hard as he could to will some of his own strength into her without hurting her.

Mrs. Macken edged into the room, carrying a candlestick with a fresh wax candle; he could smell the sweetness of the beeswax, and the scent of honey reminded him of John Grey. He wondered for an instant whether Grey had made it back to the British lines, but he had no real attention for anything but Claire.

Right this moment, he was busy regretting that heâ€™d ever disapproved of her making ether. He would have given anything he possessed to spare her awareness of the next half hour.

The setting sun washed the room in gold, and the blood seeping through her bandages showed dark.



â€œALWAYS CONCENTRATE when youâ€™re using a sharp knife,â€ I said weakly. â€œYou might lose a finger, else. My granny used to say that, and my mother, too.â€

My mother had died when I was five, my granny a few years laterâ€”but I hadnâ€™t seen her often, as Uncle Lamb spent at least half his time on archaeological expeditions round the world, with me as part of his baggage.

â€œDid you frequently play with sharp knives as a child?â€ Denny asked. He smiled, though his eyes stayed fixed on the scalpel he was carefully sharpening on a small oilstone. I could smell the oil, a soft murky scent under the tang of blood and the resinous smell of the unfinished rafters baking overhead.

â€œConstantly,â€ I breathed, and shifted my position as slowly as I could. I bit my lip hard and managed to ease my back without groaning aloud. It made Jamieâ€™s knuckles go white when I did.

He was standing by the window at the moment, clutching the sill as he looked out.

Seeing him there, broad shoulders outlined by the sinking sun, brought back a sudden memory, surprising in its sharpness. Or rather, memories, for the layers of experience came back altogether, in a wodge, and I was seeing Jamie rigid with his fear and grief, the slight black figure of Malva Christie leaning toward himâ€”and remembered feeling both a vague affront and a tremendous sense of peace as I began to leave my body, carried on the wings of fever.

I shook the memory off at once, frightened even to think of that beckoning peace. The fear was reassuring; I wasnâ€™t yet so close to death as to find it appealing.

â€œIâ€™m sure it went through the liver,â€ I said to Denny, gritting my teeth. â€œThat much blood . . .â€

â€œIâ€™m sure thee is right,â€ he said, pressing gently on my side. â€œThe liver is a great mass of densely vascularized tissue,â€ he added, turning to Jamie, who didnâ€™t turn from the window but hunched his shoulders against the possibility of being told anything else of a horrifying nature.

â€œBut the excellent thing about a wound to the liver,â€ Denny added cheerfully, â€œis that the liver, unlike the other organs of the body, will regenerate itselfâ€”or so thy wife tells me.â€



Jamie cast me a brief, haunted look, and went back to staring out the window. I breathed as shallowly as I could, trying to ignore the pain, and trying even harder not to think about what Denny was about to do.

That little exercise in self-discipline lasted about three seconds. If we were all lucky, it would be simple, and quick. He had to widen the bulletâ€™s entrance wound enough to see the direction of its track and to insert a probe along it, in hopes of finding the bullet before he had to dig for it. Then a quickâ€”I could only hopeâ€”insertion of whichever one of his jawed forceps looked most appropriate. He had three, of different lengths, plus a davier: good for grasping a rounded object, but the jaws were much bigger than the tips of a forceps and would cause more bleeding.

If it wasnâ€™t simple or quick, Iâ€™d very likely be dead within the next half hour. Denny was entirely correct in what heâ€™d told Jamie: the liver is hugely vascularized, an enormous sponge of tiny blood vessels crossed by very large ones like the hepatic portal vein. Thatâ€™s why the wound, superficially tiny, had bled so alarmingly. None of the major vessels had been damagedâ€”yetâ€”because I would have bled to death in minutes if they had been.

I was trying to breathe shallowly, because of the pain, but had an overwhelming need to draw deep, gasping breaths; I needed oxygen, because of the blood loss.

Sally flitted through my mind, and I seized on thought of her as distraction. Sheâ€™d survived the amputation, screaming through a leather gag, Gabrielâ€”yes, Gabriel, that was the name of the young man with herâ€”white-eyed as a panicked horse, fighting to hold her steady and not to faint himself. She had fainted, luckily, toward the endâ€”So sucks to you, Ernest, I thought blearilyâ€”and Iâ€™d left them both in Rachelâ€™s care.

â€œWhereâ€™s Rachel, Denny?â€ I asked, suddenly thinking to wonder. I thought Iâ€™d glimpsed her briefly in the churchyard after Iâ€™d been shot, but couldnâ€™t be sure of anything that had happened in that blur of black and white.

Dennyâ€™s hand stopped for an instant, the cautery iron he was holding suspended over a tiny brazier heâ€™d set fuming at the end of the sideboard.

â€œShe is searching for Ian, I believe,â€ he said quietly, and laid the iron very gently in the fire. â€œIs thee ready, Claire?â€

Ian, I thought. Oh, God. He hasnâ€™t come back.

â€œAs Iâ€™ll ever be,â€ I managed, already imagining the stench of burning flesh. Mine.

If the bullet was resting near one of the large vessels, Dennyâ€™s probing and grasping could rupture it and Iâ€™d hemorrhage internally. The cauterization might cause shock suddenly to set in and assassinate me without warning. Most likely, Iâ€™d survive the surgery but die of lingering infection. Consoling thought . . . At least in that case Iâ€™d have time to write a brief note to Briannaâ€”and perhaps warn Jamie to be more careful about who he married next time. . . .

â€œWait,â€ Jamie said. He didnâ€™t raise his voice, but there was enough urgency in it to freeze Denny.

I closed my eyes, rested a hand gingerly on the dressing, and tried to envision just where the damned bullet might be. Was it only in the liver, or had it gone all the way through? There was so much trauma and swelling, though, that the pain was generalized over the whole right side of my abdomen; I couldnâ€™t pick out a single, vivid line of bright pain leading to the ball.

â€œWhat is it, Jamie?â€ Denny asked, impatient to be about his business.

â€œYour betrothed,â€ Jamie said, sounding bemused. â€œComing up the road with a gang of soldiers.â€

â€œDoes thee think she is under arrest?â€ Denny asked, with a fair assumption of calm. I saw his hand tremble slightly as he picked up a linen napkin, though.

â€œI dinna think so,â€ Jamie said doubtfully. â€œSheâ€™s laughing wiâ€™ a couple of them.â€

Denny took his spectacles off and wiped them carefully.

â€œDorothea is a Grey,â€ he pointed out. â€œAny member of her family would pause on the gallows to exchange witty banter with the hangman before graciously putting the noose about his neck with his own hands.â€

That was so true that it made me laugh, though my humor was cut off at once by a jolt of pain that took my breath away. Jamie looked at me sharply, but I flapped a hand weakly at him, and he went to open the door.

Dorothea popped in, turning to wave over her shoulder and call goodbye to her escort, and I heard Denny sigh in relief as he put his spectacles back on.

â€œOh, good,â€ she said, going to kiss him. â€œI hoped you hadnâ€™t started yet. Iâ€™ve brought a few things. Mrs. Fraserâ€”Claireâ€”how are you? I mean, how is thee?â€ She put down the large basket she was carrying and came at once to the table I was lying on, to take my hand and gaze sympathetically at me with her big blue eyes.

â€œIâ€™ve been slightly better,â€ I said, making an effort not to grit my teeth. I felt clammy and nauseated.

â€œGeneral La Fayette was most concerned to hear that youâ€™d been hurt,â€ she said. â€œHe has all of his aides telling their rosary beads for you.â€

â€œHow kind,â€ I said, meaning it, but rather hoping the marquis hadnâ€™t sent a complicated greeting that I might need to compose a reply to. Having got this far, I wanted to get the bloody business over with, no matter what happened.

â€œAnd he sent this,â€ she said, a rather smug look on her face as she held up a squat green-glass bottle. â€œThee will want this first, I think, Denny.â€

â€œWhatâ€”â€ Denny began, reaching for the bottle, but Dorothea had pulled the cork, and the sweet cough-syrup smell of sherry rolled outâ€”with the ghost of a very distinctive herbal scent beneath it, something between camphor and sage.

â€œLaudanum,â€ said Jamie, and his face took on such a startling look of relief that only then did I realize how frightened he had been for me. â€œGod bless ye, Dottie!â€

â€œIt occurred to me that Friend Gilbert might just possibly have a few things that might be useful,â€ she said modestly. â€œAll the Frenchmen I know are dreadful cranks about their health and have enormous collections of tonics and pastilles and clysters. So I went and asked.â€

Jamie had me half sitting, with his arm braced behind my back and the bottle at my lips, before I could add my own thanks.



â€œWait, will you?â€ I said crossly, putting my hand over the bottleâ€™s open mouth. â€œI havenâ€™t any idea how strong this stuff is. You wonâ€™t do me any good by killing me with opium.â€

It cost me something to say so; my instinct was to drain the bottle forthwith, if it would stop the beastly pain. That nitwit Spartan who allowed the fox to gnaw his vitals had nothing on me. But, come right down to it, I didnâ€™t want to die, either of gunshot, fever, or medical misadventure. And so Dottie borrowed a spoon from Mrs. Macken, who watched in grisly fascination from the door while I took two spoonfuls, lay down, and waited an interminable quarter of an hour to judge the effects.

â€œThe marquis sent all sorts of delicacies and things to aid your recovery,â€ Dottie said encouragingly, turning to the basket and starting to lift things out by way of distraction. â€œPartridge in jelly, mushroom pÃ¢tÃ©, some terrible-smelling cheese, andâ€”â€

My sudden desire to vomit ceased just as suddenly, and I half-sat up, causing Jamie to emit a cry of alarm and grab me by the shoulders. Just as well that he did; I would have fallen onto the floor. I wasnâ€™t attending, though, my attention fixed on Dottieâ€™s basket.

â€œRoquefort,â€ I said urgently. â€œIs it Roquefort cheese? Sort of gray, with green and blue veins?â€

â€œWhy, I donâ€™t know,â€ she said, startled by my vehemence. She gingerly plucked a cloth-wrapped parcel out of the basket and held it delicately in front of me. The odor wafting from it was enough, and I relaxedâ€”very slowlyâ€”back down.

â€œGood,â€ I breathed. â€œDenzellâ€”when youâ€™ve finished . . . pack the wound with cheese.â€

Used to me as he was, this still made Dennyâ€™s jaw drop. He glanced from me to the cheese, plainly thinking that fever must have set in with unusual speed and severity.

â€œPenicillin,â€ I said, swallowing and waving a hand at the cheese. My mouth felt sticky from the laudanum. â€œThe mold that makes that sort of cheese is a species of Penicillium. Use the stuff from the veins.â€

Denny shut his mouth and nodded, determined.

â€œI will. But we must begin soon, Claire. The light is going.â€

The light was going, and the sense of urgency in the room was palpable. But Mrs. Macken brought more candles, and Denny assured me that it was a simple operation; he would do quite as well by candlelight.

More laudanum. I was beginning to feel itâ€”a not unpleasant dizzy sensationâ€”and I made Jamie lay me down again. The pain was definitely less.

â€œGive me a bit more,â€ I said, and my voice didnâ€™t seem to belong to me.

I took as deep a breath as I could and eased myself into a good position, looking with distaste at the leather gag that lay beside me. Someoneâ€”perhaps Dr. Leckieâ€”had slit my shift up the side earlier in the proceedings. I spread the edges of the opening wide and stretched out my hand to Jamie.

The shadows grew between the smoke-stained rafters. The kitchen fire was banked, but still live, and the glow of it began to show red on the hearth. Looking up at the flickering rafters in my drugged state reminded me too much of the time I had nearly died of bacterial poisoning, and I shut my eyes.



Jamie was holding my left hand, curled on my breast, his other hand gently stroking my hair, smoothing damp wisps of it off my face.

â€œBetter now, a nighean?â€ he whispered, and I noddedâ€”or thought I did. Mrs. Macken murmured some question to Dottie, received an answer, and went out. The pain was still there but distant now, a small, flickering fire that I could shut out by closing my eyes. The thud of my heartbeat was more immediate, and I was beginning to experience . . . not hallucinations, quite. Disconnected images, thoughâ€”the faces of strangers that faded in and out behind my eyes. Some were looking at me, others seemed oblivious; they smiled and sneered and grimaced but had nothing, really, to do with me.

â€œAgain, Sassenach,â€ Jamie whispered, lifting my head and putting the spoon to my lips, sticky with sherry and the bitter taste of opium. â€œOne more.â€ I swallowed and lay back. If I died, would I see my mother again? I wondered, and experienced an urgent longing for her, shocking in its intensity.

I was trying to summon her face before me, bring her out of the floating horde of strangers, when I suddenly lost my grip on my own thoughts and began to float off into a sphere of dark, dark blue.

â€œDonâ€™t leave me, Claire,â€ Jamie whispered, very close to my ear. â€œThis time, Iâ€™ll beg. Dinna go from me. Please.â€ I could feel the warmth of his face, see the glow of his breath on my cheek, though my eyes were closed.

â€œI wonâ€™t,â€ I saidâ€”or thought I saidâ€”and went. My last clear thought was that Iâ€™d forgotten to tell him not to marry a fool.



THE SKY OUTSIDE was lavender, and Claireâ€™s skin was washed with gold. Six candles burned around the room, the flames tall and still in the heavy air.

Jamie stood by her head, a hand on her shoulder as though he could comfort her. In fact, it was the sense of her, still alive under his hand, that was keeping him on his feet.

Denny made a small sound of satisfaction behind his highwaymanâ€™s mask, and Jamie saw the muscle of his bared forearm tense as he slowly drew the instrument out of Claireâ€™s body. Blood gushed from the wound, and Jamie tensed like a cat, ready to spring forward with a pledget, but no spurt followed and the blood died to a trickle, with a final small blurt of blood as the jaws of the instrument emerged, something dark clamped between them.

Denny dropped the ball into the palm of his hand and peered at it, then made an irritable noise; his glasses were fogged with the sweat of his efforts. Jamie snatched them off the Quakerâ€™s nose and rubbed them hastily on his shirttail, replacing them before Hunter could blink twice.

â€œI thank thee,â€ Denny said mildly, returning his attention to the musket ball. He turned it delicately and let out an audible breath.

â€œWhole,â€ he said. â€œThank God.â€

â€œDeo gratias,â€ Jamie echoed fervently, and reached out a hand. â€œLet me see it, will ye?â€

Hunterâ€™s brows rose, but he dropped the thing in Jamieâ€™s hand. It was startlingly warm, warm from her body. Warmer even than the air or Jamieâ€™s own sweating flesh, and the feel of it made him fold his fist over it. He stole a look at Claireâ€™s chest: rising, falling, though with alarming slowness. Almost as slowly, he opened his hand.

â€œWhat is thee looking for, Jamie?â€ Denny asked, pausing to re-sterilize his beaked probe.

â€œMarks. A slit, a crossâ€”any mark of tampering.â€ He rolled the ball carefully between his fingers, then relaxed, a small spurt of gratitude making him murmur, â€œDeo gratias,â€ again.

â€œTampering?â€ There were vertical lines between Dennyâ€™s brows, deepening as he looked up. â€œTo make the ball fragment, thee means?â€

â€œThatâ€”or worse. Sometimes a man will rub something into the marksâ€”poison, say, or . . . or shit. Just in case the wound itself isna fatal, aye?â€

Hunter looked shocked, his appalled expression clear even behind the shielding handkerchief.

â€œIf ye mean to kill a man, ye mean him harm,â€ Jamie said dryly.

â€œYes, but . . .â€ Hunter looked down, laying his tool carefully on the towel as though it were made of porcelain, not metal. His breath fluttered the handkerchief tied over his mouth. â€œBut it is one thing, surely, to kill in battle, to shoot at an enemy when it is a matter of oneâ€™s own life . . . and to form the cold-blooded intent that your enemy should die a horrible and lingering death . . .â€

Claire made a ghastly moaning noise and twitched under his hands as Denny gently squeezed the flesh on either side of the wound. Jamie gripped her by the elbows, to keep her from turning. Denny picked up the jawed thing again.

â€œYou wouldnâ€™t do it yourself,â€ Hunter said with certainty. His eyes were intent on his delicate probing, a pledget held to catch the blood that dribbled slowly from the wound. Jamie felt the loss of each drop as though it left his own veins, and felt cold; how much could she lose and still live?

â€œNo. It would be a cowardly thing.â€ But he spoke automatically, scarcely attending. She had gone limp; he saw her fingers uncurl, droop, and looked at her face, her throat, searching for a visible pulse. He felt one, in his thumb where it pressed the bone of her arm, but couldnâ€™t tell whether it was her heart that beat there or his own.

He was acutely conscious of Dennyâ€™s breath, audible behind his mask. It stopped for an instant, and Jamie glanced up from his scrutiny of Claireâ€™s face to see the Quakerâ€™s look of intentness as he drew the thing free once moreâ€”this time clutching a tiny clump of something unrecognizable. Denny opened the jaws of his forceps and dropped the clump on the towel, then used the tool to poke at it, trying to spread it, and Jamie saw the prickle of tiny dark threads as the blood soaked away into a bright red stain on the towel. Cloth.

â€œWhat does thee think?â€ Denny asked him, frowning at the thing. â€œIs it a bit of her shift, or theâ€”the bodiceâ€”or material from her stays? For from the hole in her stays, I should think . . .â€

Jamie rootled hastily in his sporran, pulled out the little silk bag in which he kept the spectacles he used for reading, and clapped these on his nose.

â€œYeâ€™ve at least two separate bits there,â€ he announced, after an anxious perusal. â€œCanvas from the stays, and a lighter bit of cloth. See?â€ He took up a probe and delicately teased the fragments apart. â€œI think that one bitâ€™s her shift.â€

Denny glanced at the disconsolate pile of bloodstained garments on the floor, and Jamie, at once divining his intent, reached in, stirred about, and pulled out the remnants of her dress.

â€œItâ€™s a clean hole,â€ Denny said, looking at the fabric Jamie spread out on the table. â€œMaybe . . .â€ He picked up the forceps and turned back, not finishing.

More probing, deeper, and Jamie gritted his teeth not to cry out in protest. â€œThe liver is so vascular,â€ sheâ€™d said, talking Denny through what he must do. â€œThe risk of hemorrhage . . .â€

â€œI know,â€ Denny murmured, not looking up. The sweat had plastered the handkerchief to his face, molding itself to nose and lips, so his speech was visible. â€œIâ€™m being . . . careful.â€

â€œKen that,â€ Jamie said, but so softly he didnâ€™t know whether Hunter heard him. Please. Please let her live. Blessed Mother, save her . . . saveher, saveher, saveher . . . The words all ran together in an instant and he lost the sense of them, but not the sense of desperate entreaty.

The red stain on the toweling under her had grown to alarming proportions by the time Hunter set down his tool again and sighed, shoulders slumping.

â€œI thinkâ€”I hopeâ€”I have it all.â€

â€œGood. Iâ€”what will ye do next?â€

He saw Denny smile a little behind the sodden cloth, olive-brown eyes soft and steady over it.

â€œCauterize it, bind the wound, and pray, Jamie.â€





NIGHTFALL

IT WAS PAST DARK when Lord John Grey, accompanied by a respectful escort and a slightly damaged Indian, limped into Clintonâ€™s camp.

Things were much as might be expected after a battle: strong currents of mingled agitation and exhaustion, the latter prevailing. No carousing amid the tents, no music. Men around the fires and camp kitchens, though, eating, getting themselves sorted, talking it over in low tones. No sense of celebrationâ€”more a sense of irritation, of disgruntled surprise. The scent of roast mutton came strongly through the smells of dust, mules, and sweating humanity, and Greyâ€™s mouth watered so much that he had to swallow before replying to Captain AndrÃ©â€™s solicitous inquiry as to his immediate desires.

â€œI need to see my brother,â€ he replied. â€œIâ€™ll attend upon General Clinton and my lord Cornwallis later. When Iâ€™ve washed and changed,â€ he added, shucking the horrible black coat for what he sincerely hoped was the last time.

AndrÃ© nodded understandingly, taking the vile garment from him.

â€œOf course, Lord John. And . . . um . . . ?â€ He nodded delicately in the direction of Ian Murray, who was attracting glances, if not stares, from pass-ersby.

â€œAh. Heâ€™d best come, too.â€

He followed AndrÃ© through the orderly aisles of tents, hearing the clinking of mess kits and feeling the comfort of the armyâ€™s stolid routine settle into place around him. Murray paced at his heel, silent. Heâ€™d no idea what the man was thinking and was too weary to care.

He did feel Murrayâ€™s step falter, though, and automatically looked over his shoulder. Murray had turned, all his attention focused on a nearby fire, this an open wood fire, around which sat several Indians. Grey wondered dimly whether these might be friends of Murrayâ€™s . . . and corrected this impression in the next second, as Murray took three giant strides, grabbed one of the Indians with a forearm round his throat, and punched him in the side with such force as to drive the otherâ€™s wind out in an audible whoop.

Murray then threw the Indian on the ground, dropped on him with both kneesâ€”Grey winced at the impactâ€”and gripped the man by the throat. The other Indians lurched out of the way, laughing and making high-pitched yips of encouragement or derision, Grey couldnâ€™t tell which.

He stood there blinking, swaying slightly, and unable either to intervene or to look away. Murray had declined to let one of the field surgeons remove the arrowhead from his shoulder, and fresh blood spattered from the wound as he punched his opponent viciouslyâ€”and repeatedlyâ€”in the face.

The Indianâ€”he had a shaved scalp and dangling earrings of shell; Grey noticed these when Murray ripped one out of the ear and stuffed it into his opponentâ€™s mouthâ€”was making a stout attempt at resistance and retaliation, in spite of his being taken at such a disadvantage.

â€œDo you suppose they are acquainted?â€ Captain AndrÃ© asked Grey. He had turned back, hearing the outcries, and was now standing beside Grey, watching the affray with interest.

â€œI think they must be,â€ Grey replied absently. He glanced briefly at the other Indians, none of whom seemed to have any interest in assisting their fellow, though a few of them appeared to be making wagers on the result. Theyâ€™d plainly been drinking, but seemed no more intoxicated than the average soldier at this time of day.

The combatants were now squirming on the ground, evidently striving for possession of a large knife worn by the man Murray had attacked. The fight was attracting attention from other quarters; a number of men had hurried over from nearby fires and were clustered behind Grey and AndrÃ©, making speculations and hasty bets, offering shouted advice.

Grey was conscious, through his fatigue, of a certain concern for Murrayâ€”and not only on Murrayâ€™s own account. On the off chance that he might at some point in future actually speak with Jamie Fraser again, he didnâ€™t want the first subject raised to be the demise of Fraserâ€™s nephew while more or less in Greyâ€™s custody. He couldnâ€™t think what the hell to do about it, though, and thus continued to stand there, watching.

Like most fights, it didnâ€™t last very long. Murray gained possession of the knife, by the brutal but effective expedient of bending one of his opponentâ€™s fingers backward â€™til it broke and grabbing the hilt as the man let go.

As Murray pressed the blade against the other manâ€™s throat, it belatedly occurred to Grey that he might really intend to kill him. The men around him certainly thought so; there was a universal gasp as Murray drew the blade across his enemyâ€™s throat.

The momentary silence engendered by this was enough for most of the assembled to hear Murray say, with a noticeable effort, â€œI give you back your life!â€ He rose off the Indianâ€™s body, swaying and staring as though blind drunk himself, and hurled the knife into the darknessâ€”causing considerable consternation and not a little cursing among those in whose direction heâ€™d hurled it.

In the excitement, most of the crowd likely didnâ€™t hear the Indianâ€™s reply, but Grey and AndrÃ© did. He sat up, very slowly, hands shaking as they pressed a fold of his shirt to the shallow cut across his throat, and said, in an almost conversational tone, â€œYou will regret that, Mohawk.â€

Murray was breathing like a winded horse, his ribs visible with each gasp. Most of the paint had gone from his face; there were long smears of red and black down his glistening chest, and only a horizontal streak of some dark color remained across his cheekbonesâ€”that and a smudge of white on the point of his shoulder, above the arrow wound. He nodded to himself, once, then twice. And, without haste, stepped back into the circle of firelight, picked up a tomahawk that was lying on the ground, and, swinging it high with both hands, brought it down on the Indianâ€™s skull.

The sound froze Grey to the marrow and silenced every man present. Murray stood still for a moment, breathing heavily, then walked away. As he passed Grey, he turned his head and said, in a perfectly conversational tone of voice, â€œHeâ€™s right. I would have,â€ before disappearing into the night.

There was a sudden, belated stir among the spectators, and AndrÃ© glanced at Grey, but he shook his head. The army took no official notice of what went on among the Indian scouts, save there was an incident involving regulars. And they didnâ€™t get more irregular than the gentleman who had just left them.

AndrÃ© cleared his throat.

â€œWas he your . . . er . . . prisoner, my lord?â€

â€œAh . . . no. A, erm . . . relation by marriage.â€

â€œOh, I see.â€





IT WAS FULL dark before the battle ended. William gathered as much from the orderly whoâ€™d brought him supper, and he could hear the sounds of a camp slowly reassembling itself as companies of soldiers came in, were dismissed, and scattered to drop their equipment and find food. Nothing like the usual sense of relaxation that lay on a camp after sunset. Everything was agitated and restlessâ€”and so was William.

His head ached horribly and someone had stitched his scalp; the stitches were tender and itching. Uncle Hal hadnâ€™t come back, and heâ€™d had no news whatever beyond the orderlyâ€™s sketchy report, which indicated only that there had been no clear victory over the Americans but that all three parts of Clintonâ€™s army had withdrawn in good order, though with considerable casualties.

He wasnâ€™t sure he wanted any further news, to be honest. There was going to be a moment of reckoning with Sir Henry about that ignored orderâ€”though he supposed Sir Henry might just possibly be too preoccupied to realize . . .

Then he heard the sound of footsteps and sat up. His fretting disappeared on the instant when the tent flap lifted and he saw his fatherâ€”Lord John, he corrected himself, but as an absent afterthought. His father seemed surprisingly small, almost fragile, and as Lord John limped slowly into the lantern light, William saw the stained bandage round his head, the makeshift sling, and when William cast his eyes down, he saw, too, the state of his fatherâ€™s bare feet.

â€œAre youâ€”â€ he began, shocked, but Lord John interrupted him.

â€œIâ€™m fine,â€ he said, and tried for a smile, though his face was white and creased with fatigue. â€œEverythingâ€™s all right, Willie. As long as youâ€™re alive, everythingâ€™s all right.â€

He saw his father sway, put out a hand as though to steady himself, and, finding nothing to take hold of, withdraw it and force his body upright. Lord Johnâ€™s voice was hoarse, and his exposed eye bloodshot and exhausted but . . . tender. William swallowed.

â€œIf you and I have things to say to each other, Willieâ€”and of course we doâ€”let it wait until tomorrow. Please. Iâ€™m not . . .â€ He made a vague, wavering gesture that ended nowhere.

The lump in Williamâ€™s throat was sudden and painful. He nodded, hands clenched tight on the bedding. His father nodded, too, drew a deep breath, and turned toward the tent flapâ€”where, William saw, Uncle Hal was hovering, eyes fixed on his brother and brows drawn with worry.

Williamâ€™s heart seized, in a lump more painful than the one in his throat.

â€œPapa!â€ His father stopped abruptly, turning to look over his shoulder.

â€œIâ€™m glad youâ€™re not dead,â€ William blurted.

A smile blossomed slowly on his fatherâ€™s battered face.

â€œMe, too,â€ he said.



IAN MADE HIS way out of the British camp, looking neither to right nor to left. The night was throbbing slowly round him. It was like being trapped inside a huge heart, he thought, feeling the thick walls squeeze him breathless, then draw away to leave him floating and weightless.

Lord John had offered to have an army surgeon tend his wound, but he couldnâ€™t bear to stay. He needed to go, to find Rachel, find Uncle Jamie. Had refused the offer of a horse, as well, unsure that he could stay on it. Heâ€™d do better walking, heâ€™d told his lordship.

And he was walking all right, though obliged to admit that he didnâ€™t feel just that well in himself. His arms were still trembling from the shock of the killing blow. It had come up from his bowels and was still echoing through his bones, couldnâ€™t seem to find a way out of his body. Well, it would settle soon enoughâ€”this wasnâ€™t the first time, though he hadnâ€™t killed anyone in a long while, and a longer while since heâ€™d done it with that much violence.

He tried to think who the last one had been, but couldnâ€™t. He could hear and see and feel things, but while his senses worked, they werenâ€™t joined up aright with the things he sensed. Troops were still marching past him into the camp. The battle must have ceased now with the darkness; the soldiers were coming home. He could hear the din they made, marching, their tin cups and canteens jangling against their cartridge boxesâ€”but he heard it clanging long after theyâ€™d passed, and he couldnâ€™t always tell the light of distant campfires from the glow of fireflies near his feet.

The Scottish overseer. At Saratoga. The manâ€™s face was suddenly there in his memory, and just as suddenly his body remembered the feel of the blow. The violent punch of his knife, hard up under the manâ€™s back ribs, straight into the kidney. The huge, strange flexing heâ€™d felt in his own body as the manâ€™s life surged up and then rushed out.

He wondered for a dazed moment whether butchers felt itâ€”that echoâ€”when they slaughtered a beast. You did, sometimes, when you cut a deerâ€™s throat, but usually not if it was just wringing a chickenâ€™s neck or crushing a weaselâ€™s skull.

â€œOr maybe ye just get used to it,â€ he said.

â€œMaybe yeâ€™d best try not to get used to it. Canna be good for your soul, a bhalaich, beinâ€™ used to that sort of thing.â€

â€œNo,â€ he agreed. â€œBut ye mean when itâ€™s with your hands, aye? Itâ€™s no the same wiâ€™ a gun or an arrow, now, is it?â€

â€œOch, no. I did wonder sometimes, does it make a difference to the man ye kill, as well as yourself?â€

Ianâ€™s feet blundered into a knee-high growth of thick weed and he realized that heâ€™d stumbled off the road. It was just past the dark of the moon, and the stars still faint overhead.

â€œDifferent,â€ he murmured, steering back into the roadway. â€œHow dâ€™ye mean, different? Heâ€™d be dead, either way.â€

â€œAye, thatâ€™s so. Iâ€™m thinkinâ€™ itâ€™s maybe worse to feel itâ€™s personal, though. Beinâ€™ shot in battleâ€™s more like beinâ€™ struck by lightning, ken? But ye canna help it beinâ€™ personal when ye do a man to death wiâ€™ your hands.â€

â€œMmphm.â€ Ian walked a bit farther in silence, the thoughts in his head circling like leeches swimming in a glass, going this way and that.

â€œAye, well,â€ he said at lastâ€”and realized suddenly that heâ€™d spoken aloud for the first time. â€œIt was personal.â€



The trembling in his bones had eased with the walking. The huge throbbing of the night had shrunk and come to rest in the arrow wound, the ache of it pulsing to the beat of his own heart.

It made him think of Rachelâ€™s white dove, though, flying serene above the hurt, and his mind steadied. He could see Rachelâ€™s face now, and he could hear crickets chirping. The cannon fire in his ears had stopped and the night grew slowly peaceful. And if his da had more to say on the subject of killing, he chose to keep his silence as they walked toward home together.



JOHN GREY EASED his battered feet into the pan, teeth gritted against the expected sensation, but to his surprise found that it caused him little pain, in spite of the torn skin and ruptured blisters.

â€œWhatâ€”thatâ€™s not hot water, is it?â€ he asked, leaning forward to look.

â€œSweet oil,â€ his brother said, his worn face relaxing a little. â€œAnd it had better be warm, not hot, or my orderly will be crucified at dawn.â€

â€œIâ€™m sure the man trembles in his boots. Thank you, by the way,â€ he added, gingerly dabbling. He was sitting on Halâ€™s cot, his brother perched on the campaign chest, pouring something out of a canteen into one of the scarred pewter cups that had accompanied him for decades.

â€œYouâ€™re welcome,â€ Hal said, handing him the cup. â€œWhat the devil happened to your eye? And is your arm broken? Iâ€™ve called for a surgeon, but it may be some time.â€ He waved a hand, encompassing the camp, the recent battle, and the stream of the returning wounded and sun-stricken.

â€œI donâ€™t need one. At first I thought my arm was broken, but Iâ€™m fairly sure itâ€™s just badly bruised. As for the eye . . . Jamie Fraser.â€

â€œReally?â€ Hal looked surprised and bent forward to peer at Greyâ€™s eye, now unwrapped from the bandages andâ€”so far as Grey himself could tellâ€”much improved. The constant watering had stopped, the swelling had gone down quite a bit, and he could, with caution, move it. From the look on Halâ€™s face, though, the redness and bruising had perhaps not quite disappeared.

â€œWell, first Jamie, and then his wife.â€ He touched the eye lightly. â€œHe punched me, and then she did something excruciating to fix it and put honey in it.â€

â€œHaving been subject to the ladyâ€™s notions of medical treatment, I am not even faintly surprised to hear that.â€ Hal lifted his cup in brief salute; Grey did the same and they drank. It was cider, and a dim recollection of applejack and Colonel Watson Smith floated through Greyâ€™s mind. Both seemed remote, as though theyâ€™d happened years ago rather than days.

â€œMrs. Fraser doctored you?â€ Grey grinned at his brother. â€œWhat did she do to you?â€

â€œWell . . . saved my life, to be perfectly frank.â€ It was hard to tell in the lantern light, but Grey thought his brother was blushing slightly.

â€œOh. In that case, Iâ€™m doubly obliged to her.â€ He raised the cup again ceremoniously, then drained it. The cider went down gratefully after a hot day with no food. â€œHow the hell did you fall into her clutches?â€ he asked curiously, extending the cup for more.

â€œI was looking for you,â€ Hal said pointedly. â€œIf youâ€™d been where you were supposed to be . . .â€

â€œYou think Iâ€™m supposed to be sitting somewhere waiting for you to turn up without warning and involve me inâ€”do you know you nearly got me hanged? Besides, I was busy being kidnapped by James Fraser at the time.â€

Hal raised one eyebrow and poured more cider. â€œYes, you did say heâ€™d punched you. What for?â€

Grey rubbed two fingers between his brows. He hadnâ€™t really noticed the headache before, only because heâ€™d had it all day. Hal was definitely making it worse, though.

â€œI couldnâ€™t begin to explain it, Hal,â€ he said tiredly. â€œCan you find me a bed? I think Iâ€™m going to die, and if by some unfortunate chance I donâ€™t, Iâ€™ll have to speak to Willie tomorrow about . . . well, never mind.â€ He drank the last of the cider and set down the cup, preparing reluctantly to lift his feet from the soothing oil.

â€œI know about William,â€ Hal said.

Grey stopped abruptly, looking dubiously at his brother, who shrugged.

â€œI saw Fraser,â€ he said simply. â€œIn Philadelphia. And when I said something to William this afternoon, he confirmed it.â€

â€œDid he?â€ Grey murmured. He was surprised but somewhat heartened by that. If Willie had calmed down sufficiently as to talk to Hal about the matter, Greyâ€™s own conversation with his son might be a trifle less fraught than heâ€™d feared.

â€œHow long have you known?â€ Hal asked curiously.

â€œFor certain? Since Willie was two or three.â€ He suddenly gave an enormous yawn, then sat blinking stupidly. â€œOhâ€”meant to ask. How did the battle go?â€

Hal looked at him with something between affront and amusement. â€œYou were bloody in it, werenâ€™t you?â€

â€œMy part of it didnâ€™t go that well. But my perspective was somewhat limited by circumstance. That, and having only one working eye,â€ he added, gently prodding the bad one. A good nightâ€™s sleep . . . Longing for bed made him sway, narrowly catching himself before simply falling into Halâ€™s cot.

â€œHard to tell.â€ Hal fished a crumpled towel out of a basket of laundry lurking disreputably in a corner and, kneeling down, lifted Greyâ€™s feet out of the oil and blotted them gently. â€œHell of a mess. Terrible ground, chopped up by creeks, either farmland or half covered in trees . . . Sir Henry got away with the baggage train and refugees all safe. But as for Washington . . .â€ He shrugged. â€œSo far as I can tell from what I saw and heard, his troops acquitted themselves well. Remarkably well,â€ he added thoughtfully. He rose to his feet. â€œLie down, John. Iâ€™ll find a bed somewhere else.â€

Grey was much too tired to argue. He simply fell over and rolled onto his back, not bothering to undress. The bad eye felt gritty, and he wondered dimly whether to ask Hal to find some honey but decided that could wait â€™til morning.

Hal took the lantern from its hook and turned toward the tent flap, but paused for an instant, turning back.

â€œDo you think Mrs. Fraserâ€”by the way, tomorrow I want to know how on earth she came to marry youâ€”do you think she knows about William and James Fraser?â€

â€œAnyone with eyes whoâ€™d seen the two of them would know,â€ Grey murmured, eyes half closed. â€œShe never mentioned it, though.â€

Hal grunted. â€œApparently everyone knewâ€”save William. Little wonder heâ€™s . . .â€

â€œThatâ€™s one word for it.â€

â€œI hadnâ€™t found one yet.â€

â€œDoes it matter?â€ Greyâ€™s eyes closed all the way. Through the drifting mists of sleep, he heard Halâ€™s quiet voice, by the tent flap.

â€œIâ€™ve had word of Ben. They say heâ€™s dead.â€





LONG ROAD HOME

JAMIE SAT BY THE tiny window in his shirt and breeches, watching his wifeâ€™s hair dry.

It was hot as a forge in the tiny spare room Mrs. Macken had given them, and his sweat lay on him in a heavy dew that broke under its own weight and ran down his sides with any movement, but he was careful not to block any faint breath of air that might seep into the room; the air reeked of Roquefort cheese and blood.

Heâ€™d soaked her hair with water from the ewer Mrs. Macken had brought and wetted her shift; it clung to her body, the round of her buttock showing pink through the fabric as it dried. It showed the thick wad of the dressing, too, and the bloody stain that spread slow upon the cloth.

Slow. His lips formed the word and he thought it passionately but didnâ€™t speak aloud. Slow! Stopping altogether would be much better, but heâ€™d settle for slow just now.

Eight pints. Thatâ€™s how much blood she said a human body had. It must vary some, though; clearly a man his size had more than a woman of hers. Single hairs were beginning to rise from the soaking mass, curling as they dried, delicate as an antâ€™s feelers.

He wished he might give her some of his blood; he had plenty. Sheâ€™d said it was possible, but not in this time. Something to do with things in the blood that mightnâ€™t match.

Her hair was a dozen colors, brown, molasses, cream and butter, sugar, sable . . . gleams of gold and silver where the dying light touched it. A broad streak of pure white at her temple, nearly the shade of her skin. She lay on her side facing him, one hand curled against her bosom, the other loose, upturned, so the inside of her wrist showed pure white, too, the blue veins heartbreaking.

Sheâ€™d said she thought of cutting her wrists when she believed him dead. He didnâ€™t think heâ€™d do it that way, if she died. Heâ€™d seen it: Toby Quinn with his wrist cut to the bone and all his blood run out across the floor, the room stinking of butchery and the word â€œteindâ€ written on the wall above him in blood, his confession. A tithe to hell, it meant, and he shuddered in spite of the heat and crossed himself.

Sheâ€™d said it was maybe the blood that had made Young Ianâ€™s bairns all dieâ€”the blood not matching betwixt him and his Mohawk wifeâ€”and that maybe it would be different with Rachel. He said a quick Ave, that it might be so, and crossed himself again.

The hair that lay upon her shoulders was coiling now, sinuous, slow as rising bread. Ought he rouse her to drink again? She needed the water, to help make more blood, to cool her with sweat. But while she slept, the pain was less. A few moments longer, then.

Not now. Please, not now.

She shifted, moaning, and he saw that she was different; restless now. The stain on her bandage had changed color, darkened from scarlet to rust as it dried. He laid a hand softly on her arm and felt the heat.

The bleeding had stopped. The fever had begun.



NOW THE TREES were talking to him. He wished theyâ€™d stop. The only thing Ian Murray wanted just now was silence. He was alone for the moment, but his ears buzzed and his head still throbbed with noise.

That always happened for a bit after a fight. You were listening so hard, to start with, for the sounds of the enemy, the direction of the wind, the voice of a saint behind you . . . you began to hear the voices of the forest, like you did hunting. And then you heard the shots and shouting, and when there were moments when that stopped, you heard the blood pounding round your body and beating in your ears, and, all in all, it took some time for the racket to die down afterward.

He had brief flashes of things that had happened during the dayâ€”milling soldiers; the thud of the arrow that struck him; the face of the Abenaki heâ€™d killed by the fire; the look of George Washington on his big white horse, racing up the road, waving his hatâ€”but these came and went in a fog of confusion, appearing as though revealed to him by a stroke of lightning, then disappearing into a buzzing mist.

A wind went whispering through the branches over him, and he felt it on his skin as though heâ€™d been brushed with sandpaper. What might Rachel say, when he told her what heâ€™d done?

He could still hear the sound when the tomahawk caved in the Abenakiâ€™s skull. He could still feel it, too, in the bones of his arms, in the bursting pain of his wound.

Dimly, he realized that his feet were no longer keeping to the road; he was stumbling over clumps of grass, stubbing his moccasin-clad toes on rocks. He looked back to find his pathâ€”he saw it, plain, a wavering line of black . . . Why was it wavering?

He didnâ€™t want silence, after all. He wanted Rachelâ€™s voice, no matter what she might say to him.

It came to him dimly that he couldnâ€™t go any farther. He was aware of a faint sense of surprise but was not afraid.

He didnâ€™t remember falling but found himself on the ground, his hot cheek pressed against the cool prickle of pine needles. Laboriously, he got to his knees and scraped away the thick layer of fallen needles. Then he was lying with his body on damp earth, the blanket of needles half pulled over him; he could do no more and said a brief prayer to the tree, that it might protect him through the night.

And as he fell headlong into darkness, he did hear Rachelâ€™s voice, in memory.

â€œThy lifeâ€™s journey lies along its own path, Ian,â€ she said, â€œand I cannot share thy journeyâ€”but I can walk beside thee. And I will.â€

His last thought was that he hoped sheâ€™d still mean it when he told her what heâ€™d done.





IN WHICH ROSY-FINGERED DAWN SHOWS UP MOB-HANDED

GREY WOKE TO THE drums of reveille, not startled by the accustomed rattle but with no clear idea where he was. In camp. Well, that much was obvious. He swung his legs out of the cot and sat up slowly, taking stock. His left arm hurt a lot, one of his eyes was stuck shut, and his mouth was so dry he could barely swallow. Heâ€™d slept in his clothes, smelled rank, and needed badly to piss.

He groped under the cot, found a utensil, and used it, noting in a rather dreamy way that his urine smelled of apples. That brought back the taste of cider and, with it, full recollection of the day and night before. Honey and flies. Artillery. Jamie, blood down his face. Rifle butt and the crack of bone. William . . . Hal . . .

Almost full recollection. He sat down and remained quite still for a moment, trying to decide whether Hal had really told him that his eldest son, Benjamin, was dead. Surely not. It must have been a shred of nightmare, lingering in his mind. And yet he had the dreadful feeling of doomed certainty that comes down like a curtain on the mind, smothering disbelief.

He stood up, staggering a little, determined to go and find his brother. He hadnâ€™t yet found his shoes, though, when the flap was thrown back and Hal came in, followed by an orderly with a basin, a steaming pitcher, and shaving implements.

â€œSit down,â€ Hal said, in a completely ordinary voice. â€œYouâ€™ll have to wear one of my uniforms, and youâ€™re not doing it smelling like that. What the devil happened to your hair?â€

Grey had forgotten his hair and flattened a palm on top of his head, surprised at the bristly stubble there.

â€œOh. A ruse de guerre.â€ He sat down slowly, eyes on his brother. The bad eye had come open, though it was unpleasantly crusty, and so far as Grey could see, Hal looked much as he usually did. Tired, of course, worn, and a little haunted, but everyone looked like that the day after a battle. Surely if it were true, heâ€™d look different. Worse, somehow.

He would have asked, but Hal didnâ€™t linger, going off and leaving John in the hands of the orderly. Before the ablutions were complete, a young Scottish surgeon with freckles appeared, yawning as though he hadnâ€™t slept all night, and blinked blearily at Greyâ€™s arm. He prodded this in a professional manner, pronounced the bone cracked but not broken, and put it in a sling.

The sling had to be removed almost at once, in order for him to dressâ€”another orderly arrived with a uniform and a tray of breakfastâ€”and by the time he was made tidy and had been forcibly fed, he was wild with impatience.

He would have to wait for Hal to reappear, though; no point going out to scour the camp for him. And he really must talk to his brother before seeking out William. A small dish of honey had been provided with his toast, and he was dipping a dubious finger into it, wondering whether he ought to try dabbing it into his eye, when at last the flap opened again and his brother was with him.

â€œDid you actually tell me that Ben is dead?â€ he blurted at once. Halâ€™s face contracted a bit, but his jaw was set.

â€œNo,â€ Hal said evenly. â€œI told you that Iâ€™d had news of Ben, and they said he was dead. I donâ€™t believe it.â€ He gave John a stare defying him to contradict this belief.

â€œOh. Good,â€ Grey said mildly. â€œThen I donâ€™t believe it, either. Who told you, though?â€

â€œThatâ€™s why I donâ€™t believe it,â€ Hal replied, turning to lift the tent flap and peer outâ€”evidently to be sure of not being overheard, and the thought made Greyâ€™s belly flutter a little. â€œIt was Ezekiel Richardson who brought me the news, and I wouldnâ€™t trust that fellow if he told me I had a hole in the seat of my breeches, let alone something like that.â€

The flutter in Greyâ€™s belly became a full-blown beating of wings.

â€œYour instincts havenâ€™t led you amiss there,â€ he said. â€œSit down and have a piece of toast. I have a few things to tell you.â€



WILLIAM WOKE with a shattering headache and the conviction that he had forgotten something important. Clutching his head, he discovered a bandage wound round it, chafing his ear. He pulled it off impatiently; there was blood on it, but not much and all dried. He recalled vague bits of things from the night beforeâ€”pain, nausea, his head swimming, Uncle Hal . . . and then an image of his father, white-faced and fragile . . . â€œIf you and I have things to say to each other . . .â€ Christ, had he dreamed that?

He said something bad in German, and a young voice repeated it, rather doubtfully.

â€œWhatâ€™s that mean, sir?â€ asked Zeb, who had popped up beside his cot with a covered tray.

â€œYou donâ€™t need to know, and donâ€™t repeat it,â€ William said, sitting up. â€œWhat happened to my head?â€

Zebâ€™s brow creased.

â€œYou donâ€™t remember, sir?â€

â€œIf I did, would I be asking you?â€

Zebâ€™s brow creased in concentration, but the logic of this question escaped him, and he merely shrugged, set down the tray, and answered the first one.

â€œColonel Grey said you was hit on the head by deserters.â€

â€œDesertâ€”oh.â€ He stopped to consider that. British deserters? No . . . there was a reason why German profanity had sprung to his mind. He had a fleeting memory of Hessians, and . . . and what?

â€œColensoâ€™s got over the shits,â€ Zeb offered helpfully.

â€œGood to know the dayâ€™s starting out well for somebody. Oh, Jesus.â€ Pain crackled inside his skull, and he pressed a hand to his head. â€œHave you got anything to drink on that tray, Zeb?â€

â€œYes, sir!â€ Zeb uncovered the tray, triumphantly revealing a dish of coddled eggs with toast, a slice of ham, and a beaker of something that looked suspiciously murky but smelled strongly of alcohol.

â€œWhatâ€™s in this?â€

â€œDunno, sir, but Colonel Grey says itâ€™s a hair-of-the-dog-what-bit-you sort of thing.â€

â€œOh.â€ So it hadnâ€™t been a dream. He shoved that thought aside for the moment and regarded the beaker with a cautious interest. Heâ€™d had the first of his fatherâ€™s restoratives when he was fourteen and had mistaken the punch being prepared for Lord Johnâ€™s dinner party as the same sort that ladies had at garden parties. Heâ€™d had a few more in the years since and found them invariably effective, if rather startling to drink.



â€œRight, then,â€ he said, and, taking a deep breath, picked up the beaker and drained it, swallowing heroically without pausing for breath.

â€œCor!â€ said Zeb, admiring. â€œThe cook said he could send some sausages, was you up to eating â€™em.â€

William merely shook his headâ€”being momentarily incapable of speechâ€”and picked up a piece of toast, which he held for a moment, not quite ready to consider actually inserting it into his mouth. His head still hurt, but the restorative had jarred loose a few more bits from the detritus in his brain.

â€œ. . . Advice? Youâ€™re too old to be given it and too young to take it. . . .â€

â€œ. . . Er spricht Deutsch. Er gehÃ¶rt! . . .â€ He speaks German. He heard.

â€œI heard,â€ he said slowly. â€œWhat did I hear?â€

Zeb appeared to think this another rhetorical question and, instead of trying to answer it, asked one of his own.

â€œWhat happened to Goth, sir?â€ His thin face was solemn, as though he expected to receive bad news.

â€œGoth,â€ William repeated blankly. â€œHas something happened to Goth?â€

â€œWell, heâ€™s gone, sir,â€ Zeb said, apparently trying to be tactful. â€œThat isâ€”when the regulars took you and the Indian away from the Rebels, you wasnâ€™t on him.â€

â€œWhen the . . . what Indian?â€”what the devil happened yesterday, Zeb?â€

â€œHow would I know?â€ Zeb said, affronted. â€œWasnâ€™t there, was I?â€

â€œNo, of courseâ€”bloody hell. Is my uncleâ€”the Duke of Pardloeâ€”in camp? I need to talk to him.â€

Zeb looked dubious.

â€œWell, I can go and look for him, I sâ€™pose.â€

â€œDo, please. Now.â€ William waved him off, then sat still for a moment, trying to stick the jagged fragments of his memory back together. Rebels? Goth . . . He did recall something about Goth, but what was it? Had he run into Rebels, who took the horse? But what was this about Indians and deserters, and why did he keep hearing echoes of German speech in the back of his brain?

And who, come to think of it, was the Colonel Grey that Zeb had referred to? Heâ€™d assumed it was Uncle Halâ€”but his fatherâ€™s rank was lieutenant colonel, and heâ€™d also be addressed as â€œColonelâ€ in common use. He glanced at the tray and the empty beaker. Uncle Hal certainly knew about the hair of the dog, but . . .

â€œAs long as youâ€™re alive, everythingâ€™s all right.â€

He put the untouched toast down, a sudden lump in his throat. Again. Heâ€™d had the lump last night, when he saw Papa. When heâ€™d said to his fatherâ€”yes, God damn it, his father!â€”â€œIâ€™m glad youâ€™re not dead.â€

He maybe wasnâ€™t quite ready to talk to Papaâ€”or Papa to himâ€”and he didnâ€™t quite agree that everything was all right, but . . .

A shaft of brilliant sunlight lanced into his face as the tent flap was shoved aside, and he sat bolt upright, swinging his legs out of bed to be ready to meetâ€”

But it wasnâ€™t either his uncle or his father who appeared out of the eye-watering blur of sunlight. It was Banastre Tarleton, in uniform but wigless and unbuttoned, looking indecently cheerful for someone whose face seemed to have been beaten badly not too long ago.

â€œAlive, are you, Ellesmere?â€ Ban spotted the dish and, scooping up a coddled egg in his fingers, gulped it. He licked his buttery fingers, making pleased noises.

â€œChrist, Iâ€™m hungry. Been up since dawn. Killing on an empty stomach leaves you rare sharp-set, Iâ€™ll say that. Can I have the rest?â€

â€œBe my guest. Whoâ€™ve you been killing for breakfast? Rebels?â€

Tarleton looked surprised, arrested with a mouthful of toast. He chewed this imperfectly and bolted the bite before answering with a shower of crumbs.

â€œNo, Washingtonâ€™s troops withdrew to the south, so far as I know. Hessian deserters. The same lot that crowned you and left you for dead, or so I assume. They had your horse; recognized him.â€ He reached for another egg, and William thrust a spoon into his hand.

â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, eat like a Christian. Do you have my horse?â€

â€œI do. Heâ€™s lame in the right fore, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s bad. Mmm . . . have you got your own cook?â€

â€œNo, heâ€™s my uncleâ€™s. Tell me about the deserters. They knocked me on the head, and my memoryâ€™s a bit spotty.â€ More than a bit, but chunks of it were beginning to come back pretty fast now.

Between bites, Tarleton gave him the story. A company of mercenaries under von Knyphausen had made up their minds to desert during the battle, but not all the men were of the same mind. Those in favor of desertion had drawn away a bit and were quietly discussing whether it was necessary to kill the dissenters, when William had shown up unexpectedly in their midst.

â€œThat knocked them a bit skew-ways, as you might surmise.â€ Tarleton, having finished the eggs and most of the toast, picked up the beaker and looked disappointed at finding it empty.

â€œThereâ€™s probably water in that canteen,â€ William said, motioning toward the battered tin-and-leather object hanging from the tent pole. â€œSo thatâ€™s it. . . . They looked a bit nervous, but when I asked one of them in German whether there was a farrier nearbyâ€”that was it! Goth threw a shoe, thatâ€™s why heâ€”but then I heard someone whispering, sounding frantic, and he was saying, â€˜He heard! He knows!â€™ Mustâ€™ve meant he thought Iâ€™d overheard them plotting and knew what they were up to.â€

He breathed out in relief at having this much of the previous day restored to him.

Tarleton nodded. â€œImagine so. They did kill some of the dissentersâ€”gather a barney broke out after they bashed you on the head and threw you into the ravineâ€”but not all of them.â€

A few of the mercenaries had escaped and headed for von Knyphausen, who, upon hearing the news, had sent a dispatch to Clinton asking for assistance in dealing with the miscreants.

William nodded at this. It was always better to have matters like desertion or treason dealt with by troops outside the affected companies. And knowing Ban Tarleton, he would have leapt at the chance to track down the deserters andâ€”

â€œWere you told to kill them?â€ he asked, striving for casualness.



Tarleton gave him an eggy grin and wiped a few lingering crumbs off his chin.

â€œNot specifically. Got the impression that as long as I brought a few back to tell the tale, no one much cared how many. And there was a hint of pour encourager les autres in my orders.â€

Politely suppressing his shock at the revelation that Tarleton could read, let alone read Voltaire, William nodded.

â€œI see. My orderly said something rather curious: mentioned that Iâ€™d been found by Rebelsâ€”with an Indian. Dâ€™you know anything about that?â€

Tarleton looked surprised, but shook his head.

â€œNot a thing. Ohâ€”â€ Heâ€™d sat down on the stool and now rocked back a little, hands clasped about one knee, looking pleased with himself. â€œI do know something, though. Recall you asked me about Harkness?â€

â€œHarkness . . . oh, yes!â€ Williamâ€™s exclamation had less to do with mention of Captain Harkness and more to do with the important thing heâ€™d forgotten, which had just come back to him: Jane and her sister.

He had an immediate impulse to get up and go find her, make sure they were all right. The fugitive Loyalists and camp followers would have been well clear of the actual battle, of courseâ€”but the violence and agitation that attended fighting didnâ€™t simply stop when the fighting did. And it wasnâ€™t only deserters and scavengers who looted, raped, and hunted among the hapless sheep.

He spared a flickering thought for Anne Endicott and her familyâ€”but they did at least have a man to protect them, however ill-equipped. Jane and Fanny . . . but surely Zeb would have known, if anythingâ€”

â€œWhat?â€ He looked blankly at Tarleton. â€œWhat did you say?â€

â€œThat knock on the head affected your hearing, too, did it?â€ Ban took a swig from the canteen. â€œI said I made inquiries. Harkness never joined his regiment. For all anyone knows, heâ€™s still in Philadelphia.â€

Williamâ€™s mouth felt dry. He reached for the canteen and took a swallow; the water was warm and tin-tasting, but wet.

â€œAbsent without leave, do you mean?â€

â€œVery much without leave,â€ Tarleton assured him. â€œLast anyone recalls seeing him, he was promising to go back to some brothel and give some whore a proper seeing-to. Maybe she saw to him, instead!â€ He laughed heartily at the thought.

William stood up abruptly, thenâ€”for something to doâ€”reached to replace the canteen on its nail. The tent flap was down, but a stray beam of dust-filled sunlight still fell through the gap, catching the glitter of metal. His officerâ€™s gorget hung from the nail, its silver gleaming in the sun.



â€œPERCIVAL WAINWRIGHT?â€ John hadnâ€™t seen Hal so disconcerted since the events concerning their fatherâ€™s deathâ€”which had also involved Percy, come to think of it.

â€œIn theâ€”very fashionableâ€”flesh. Heâ€™s apparently an adviser to the Marquis de La Fayette.â€



â€œWhoâ€™s that?â€

â€œA flash young frog with a lot of money,â€ Grey said with a one-shouldered shrug. â€œRebel general. Said to be very close to Washington.â€

â€œClose,â€ Hal repeated, with a sharp look at Grey. â€œClose to Wainwright, too, you think?â€

â€œProbably not that way,â€ he replied calmly, though his heart beat a little faster. â€œI gather youâ€™re not altogether surprised that he isnâ€™t dead. Percy, I mean.â€ He was vaguely affronted; heâ€™d gone to a lot of trouble to make it appear that Percy had died in prison while awaiting trial for sodomy.

Hal merely snorted. â€œMen like that never die so conveniently. Why the bloody hell is he telling you this, do you think?â€

Grey suppressed the vivid memory of bergamot, red wine, and petitgrain.

â€œI donâ€™t know. But I do know heâ€™s deeply involved with French interests, andâ€”â€

â€œWainwrightâ€™s never been involved with any interests other than his own,â€ Hal interrupted brusquely. He gave John a sharp look. â€œYouâ€™d do well to remember that.â€

â€œI doubt I shall ever see the fellow again,â€ John replied, overlooking the implication that his brother considered him gullibleâ€”or worse. He was entirely aware that while Hal was treating Richardsonâ€™s news of Ben with scorn, and was very likely right to do so, neither of them could completely ignore the possibility that the man had been telling the truth.

Hal verified this assumption by smacking his fist down on the campaign chest, making the pewter cups jump and fall over. He stood abruptly.

â€œBloody hell,â€ he muttered. â€œStay here!â€

â€œWhere are you going?â€

Hal paused at the tent flap for an instant. His face was still haggard, but John recognized the battle light in his eyes.

â€œTo arrest Richardson.â€

â€œYou canâ€™t arrest him yourself, for Godâ€™s sake!â€ Grey was on his feet, too, reaching for Halâ€™s sleeve.

â€œWhich regiment does he belong to?â€

â€œThe Fifth, but heâ€™s detached. I told you he was an intelligencer, did I not?â€ The word â€œintelligencerâ€ dripped with contempt.

â€œAll rightâ€”Iâ€™ll speak to Sir Henry first.â€

John had got a grip on Halâ€™s arm and tightened his hold at this. â€œI should have thought youâ€™d had enough of scandal by now,â€ he said, trying for calmness. â€œTake a breath and imagine what will likely happen if you do that. Assuming that Sir Henry would take the time to consider your request. Today, for Godâ€™s sake?â€ He could hear the army moving outside; there was no danger of pursuit from Washingtonâ€™s troops, but Clinton was not going to hang about. His division, with its baggage and refugees under its wing, would be on the road within the hour.

Halâ€™s arm was hard as marble under Johnâ€™s hand and stayed that way. But he did stop, breathing with a slow, deep regularity. At last he turned his head and looked into his brotherâ€™s eyes. A beam of sunlight threw every line in his face into stark relief.



â€œName one thing you think I wouldnâ€™t do,â€ he said quietly, â€œin order not to have to tell Minnie that Ben is dead.â€

Grey drew one long, deep breath of his own and nodded, letting go.

â€œPoint taken. Whatever you mean to do, Iâ€™ll help. But first I have to find William. What Percy saidâ€”â€

â€œAh.â€ Hal blinked and his face relaxed a fraction. â€œYes, of course. Meet you here in half an hour.â€



WILLIAM HAD BARELY finished dressing before the message heâ€™d been halfway expecting arrived from Sir Henry, delivered by Lieutenant Foster, whom he knew slightly. Foster grimaced sympathetically when handing it over.

William observed Sir Henry Clintonâ€™s personal seal: not a good sign. On the other hand, if he was to be arrested for being absent without leave the previous day, Harry Foster would have brought an armed escort and taken him off without a by-your-leave. That was mildly heartening, and he broke the seal without hesitation.

In the event, it was a terse note advising him that he was relieved of duty until further noticeâ€”but that was all. He exhaled, only then realizing that heâ€™d been holding his breath.

But of course Sir Henry wouldnâ€™t imprison himâ€”how and where, with the army on the move? Short of putting him in irons and transporting him by wagon . . . Realistically, Clinton couldnâ€™t even confine him to quarters; the quarters in question were beginning to shake overhead as his uncleâ€™s orderly set to dismantling the tent.

All right, then. He stuffed the note into his pocket, stuffed his feet into his boots, seized up his hat, and went out, feeling not that bad, all things considered. He had a headache, but it was bearable, and heâ€™d managed to eat what breakfast Tarleton had left.

When things settled down and Sir Henry got round to taking official notice of his disobedience of orders, William could fish up Captain AndrÃ© and have him explain about going to find Tarleton, and all would be well. Meanwhile, heâ€™d go down to the camp followersâ€™ area and find Jane.

There was a strong bitter smell of fresh cabbage floating over the sprawl of makeshift shelters and human detritus, and a scatter of farm wagons drawn up along the road, with women crowding round them. The army cooks fed the refugees, but rations were sparseâ€”and had doubtless been disrupted by the battle.

He walked along the road, keeping an eye out for Jane or Fanny, but didnâ€™t spot either one. His eye attuned for a young girl, though, he did see Peggy Endicott, trudging down the road with a bucket in either hand.

â€œMiss Peggy! May I offer my assistance, maâ€™am?â€ He smiled down at her and was warmed to see her own faceâ€”somewhat anxious beforeâ€”bloom into delight under her cap.

â€œCaptain!â€ she cried, nearly dropping her buckets in her excitement. â€œOh, Iâ€™m so happy to see you! We were all so worried for you, you know, in the battle, and we all said a prayer for your safety, but Papa told us you would surely prevail over the wicked Rebels and God would see you safe.â€

â€œYour lovely prayers were to great effect,â€ he assured her gravely, taking the buckets. One was full of water and the other of turnips, their green tops wilting over the rim. â€œAre your mama and papa well, then, and your sisters?â€

They walked along together, Peggy dancing on her toes and chattering like an affable small parrot. William kept an eye peeled for Jane or Fanny among the laundresses; it was safer near those redoubtable ladies than in some other parts of the camp. There were no kettles boiling this morning, of course, but the scent of lye soap floated on the humid air like scum on a cauldron full of dirty clothes.

There was no sign of Jane and Fanny by the time heâ€™d reached the Endicottsâ€™ wagonâ€”still on all four wheels, he was glad to see. He was greeted warmly by all the Endicotts, though the girls and Mrs. Endicott made a great fuss of the lump on his head when he took his hat off to help with the loading of their wagon.

â€œNothing, maâ€™am, the merest bruise,â€ he assured Mrs. Endicott for the ninth time, when she urged him to sit down in the shade and drink some water with the tiniest bit of brandy in it, for they still had some, thank goodness. . . .

Anne, who had maneuvered herself close to him, passing him items to be loaded, leaned in with a tea chest and let her hand brush hisâ€”deliberately, he was sure.

â€œWill you stay in New York, do you think?â€ she asked, stooping to pick up a portmanteau. â€œOr perhapsâ€”you must excuse my prying, but people will talkâ€”go back to England? Miss Jernigan said that you might.â€

â€œMiss . . . oh, of course.â€ He recalled Mary Jernigan, a very flirtatious blond piece with whom heâ€™d danced at a ball in Philadelphia. He glanced over the throng of Loyalist refugees. â€œIs she here?â€

â€œYes,â€ Anne replied, a little tersely. â€œDr. Jernigan has a brother in New York; they will stay with him for a time.â€ She collected herselfâ€”he could see that she was regretting having recalled his attention to Mary Jerniganâ€”and smiled at him, deeply enough as to invoke the dimple in her left cheek. â€œYou neednâ€™t take refuge with reluctant relatives, though, need you? Miss Jernigan said that you have a great vast estate awaiting you in England.â€

â€œMmm,â€ he said noncommittally. His father had warned him early on about marriage-minded young women with an eye to his fortune, and heâ€™d met quite a few of them. Still, he liked Anne Endicott and her family and was inclined to think they had a real regard for him, as well, despite his position and the pragmatical considerations that must now afflict Anne and her sisters, with their fatherâ€™s affairs so precarious.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ he said, taking the portmanteau from her. â€œI truly have no idea whatâ€™s to become of me. Who does, in wartime?â€ He smiled, a little ruefully, and she seemed to feel his sense of uncertainty, for she impulsively laid a hand on his sleeve.

â€œWell, be assured that you have friends, at least, who care what becomes of you,â€ she said softly.



â€œThank you,â€ he said, and turned his face toward the cart, lest she see how much that touched him.

In turning, though, his eye caught a purposeful movement, someone threading toward him through the crowd, and Anne Endicottâ€™s soft dark eyes disappeared abruptly from his mind.

â€œSir!â€ It was his groom Colenso Baragwanath, gasping from the effort of running. â€œSir, have youâ€”â€

â€œThere you are, Baragwanath! What the devil are you doing here, and where have you left Madras? Good news, though: Gothâ€™s come back. Colonel Tarleton has him andâ€”what, for Godâ€™s sake?â€ For Colenso was squirming as though he had a snake in his breeches, his square Cornish face contorted with information.

â€œJane and Fannyâ€™re gone, sir!â€

â€œGone? Gone where?â€

â€œDunno, sir. But theyâ€™ve gone. I came back to get my jacket and the shelter was still up, but their things were gone and I couldnâ€™t find â€™em and when I asked the folk who camps near us, they said as the girls had rolled up their bundles and sneaked off!â€

William didnâ€™t waste time inquiring how one could possibly sneak out of an open camp of several thousand people, let alone why that should be necessary.

â€œWhich way did they go?â€

â€œThat way, sir!â€ Colenso pointed down the road.

William rubbed a hand over his face and stopped abruptly when he inadvertently touched the bruised swelling on his left temple.

â€œOuch. Well, bloody hellâ€”oh, I beg your pardon, Miss Endicott.â€ For at this point he became aware of Anne Endicott at his elbow, eyes round with curiosity.

â€œWho are Jane and Fanny?â€ she asked.

â€œAhh . . . two young ladies who are traveling under my protection,â€ he said, knowing exactly what effect that information was likely to have, but there wasnâ€™t much help for it. â€œVery young ladies,â€ he added, in the vain hope of improving things. â€œDaughters of a . . . um, distant cousin.â€

â€œOh,â€ she said, looking distinctly unconvinced. â€œBut theyâ€™ve run off? Whyever should they do such a thing?â€

â€œDamned if Iâ€”er, beg pardon, maâ€™am. I donâ€™t know, but I must go and find out. Will you make my excuses to your parents and sisters?â€

â€œIâ€”of course.â€ She made a small, abortive gesture toward him, putting out her hand and then withdrawing it. She looked both startled and slightly affronted. He regretted it, but there wasnâ€™t time to do anything about it.

â€œYour servant, maâ€™am,â€ he said, and, bowing, left her.



IN THE END, it was half a day, rather than half an hour, before John saw Hal again. He found his brother, quite by chance, standing by the road that led northward, watching the marching columns go past. Most of the camp had already left; only the cook wagons and laundry kettles were trundling past now, the disorderly sprawl of camp followers spreading out behind them like the plague of lice over the land of Egypt.

â€œWilliamâ€™s gone,â€ he said to Hal without preamble.

Hal nodded, face somber. â€œSo is Richardson.â€

â€œBloody hell.â€

Halâ€™s groom was standing by, holding two horses. Hal jerked his head at a dark-bay mare and took the reins of his own horse, a light-bay gelding with a blaze and one white stocking.

â€œWhere do you think weâ€™re going?â€ John inquired, seeing his brother turn the geldingâ€™s head south.

â€œPhiladelphia,â€ Hal replied, tight-lipped. â€œWhere else?â€

Grey could himself think of any number of alternatives, but recognized a rhetorical question when he heard one and contented himself with asking, â€œHave you got a clean handkerchief?â€

Hal gave him a blank look, then rummaged in his sleeve, pulling out a crumpled but unused linen square.

â€œApparently. Why?â€

â€œI expect weâ€™re going to need a flag of truce at some point. The Continental army lying presently between us and Philadelphia, I mean.â€

â€œOh, that.â€ Hal stuffed the handkerchief back up his sleeve and said no more until they had negotiated their way past the last trailing remnants of the horde of refugees and found themselves more or less alone on the road leading south.

â€œNo one could be sure, in the confusion,â€ he said, as though heâ€™d last spoken ten seconds before. â€œBut it looks very much as though Captain Richardson has deserted.â€

â€œWhat?!â€

â€œNot a bad moment to choose, really,â€ Hal said reflectively. â€œNo one would have noticed he was gone for days, had I not come looking for him. He was in camp last night, though, and unless heâ€™s disguised himself as a teamster or a laundress, heâ€™s not here any longer.â€

â€œThe contingency seems remote,â€ Grey said. â€œWilliam was here this morningâ€”both your orderly and his young grooms saw him, and so did a Colonel Tarleton of the British Legion, who breakfasted with him.â€

â€œWho? Oh, him.â€ Hal waved off Tarleton as a distraction. â€œClinton values him, but I never trust a man with lips like a girlâ€™s.â€

â€œRegardless, he seems to have had nothing to do with Williamâ€™s disappearance. The groom Baragwanath thinks that William went off to see about a couple of . . . young women among the camp followers.â€

Hal glanced at him, one brow raised.

â€œWhat sort of young women?â€

â€œProbably the sort youâ€™re thinking,â€ John replied, a little tersely.

â€œAt that hour of the morning, after being bashed on the head the night before? And young women, plural? The boyâ€™s got stamina, Iâ€™ll say that for him.â€

Grey could have said a number of other things about William at this point, but didnâ€™t. â€œSo you think Richardsonâ€™s deserted.â€ That would explain Halâ€™s focus on Philadelphia; if Percy was right and Richardson was in fact an American agent, where else might he go at this point?

â€œIt seems the most likely possibility. Also . . .â€ Hal hesitated for a moment, but then his mouth firmed. â€œIf I believed that Benjamin was dead, what might I be expected to do?â€

â€œGo and make inquiries into his death,â€ Grey replied, suppressing the queasy feeling the notion induced. â€œClaim his body, at the least.â€

Hal nodded. â€œBen wasâ€”or isâ€”being held at a place in New Jersey called Middletown Encampment. Iâ€™ve not been there, but itâ€™s in the middle of Washingtonâ€™s strongest territory, in the Watchung Mountains. Nest of Rebels.â€

â€œAnd youâ€™d be unlikely to undertake that sort of journey with a large armed guard,â€ John observed. â€œYouâ€™d go alone, or perhaps with an orderly, an ensign or two. Or me.â€

Hal nodded. They rode for a bit, each alone with his thoughts.

â€œSo youâ€™re not going to the Watchung Mountains,â€ Grey said at last. His brother sighed deeply and set his jaw.

â€œNot immediately. If I can catch up with Richardson, I may find out whatâ€™s really happenedâ€”or not happenedâ€”to Ben. After that . . .â€

â€œDo you have a plan for proceeding once we reach Philadelphia?â€ Grey inquired. â€œGiven that itâ€™s in the hands of the Rebels?â€

Halâ€™s lips compressed. â€œI will have, by the time we get there.â€

â€œI daresay. I have one now, though.â€

Hal looked at him, thumbing a hank of damp hair behind his ear. His hair was carelessly tied back; heâ€™d not bothered to have it plaited or clubbed this morning, a sure sign of his agitation. â€œDoes it involve anything patently insane? Your better plans always do.â€

â€œNot at all. Weâ€™re certain to encounter the Continentals, as I said. Assuming we arenâ€™t shot on sight, we produce your flag of truceâ€â€”he nodded at his brotherâ€™s sleeve, from which the edge of the handkerchief was droopingâ€”â€œand demand to be taken to General Fraser.â€

Hal gave him a startled look.

â€œJames Fraser?â€

â€œThe same.â€ Greyâ€™s knotted stomach clenched a little tighter at the thought. At both the thought of speaking to Jamie againâ€”and the thought of telling him that William was missing. â€œHe fought with Benedict Arnold at Saratoga, and his wife is friendly with the man.â€

â€œGod help General Arnold, in that case,â€ Hal murmured.

â€œAnd who else has a better reason for helping us in this matter than does Jamie Fraser?â€

â€œWho indeed?â€ They rode for some time in silence, Hal apparently lost in thought. It wasnâ€™t until they paused to find a creek and water the horses that he spoke again, water streaming down his face where heâ€™d splashed it.

â€œSo youâ€™ve not only somehow married Fraserâ€™s wife, but youâ€™ve accidentally been raising his illegitimate son for the last fifteen years?â€

â€œApparently so,â€ Grey said, in a tone that he hoped indicated complete unwillingness to talk about it. For once, Hal took the hint.

â€œI see,â€ he said, and, with no further questions, wiped his face with the flag of truce and mounted up.





MOONRISE

IT HADNâ€™T BEEN a peaceful day. Apparently Jamie had somehow retained sufficient presence of mind last night to write a brief noteâ€”though he didnâ€™t recall doing soâ€”to La Fayette, explaining what had happened and confiding care of his troops to the marquis. This he had sent with Lieutenant Bixby, with instructions to notify the captains and militia commanders of his companies. After which, heâ€™d forgotten everything but Claire.

Everything had not forgotten him, though. The sun was barely up before a stream of officers appeared at Mrs. Mackenâ€™s door, in search of General Fraser. Mrs. Macken took every arrival as being the possible bearer of bad news concerning her still-missing husband, and the reek of burnt porridge rose through the house, seeping into the walls like the smell of fear.

Some came with questions, some with news or gossipâ€”General Lee was relieved of duty, was under arrest, had gone to Philadelphia, had turned his coat and joined Clinton, had hanged himself, had challenged Washington to a duel. A messenger arrived from General Washington with a personal note of sympathy and good wishes; another came from La Fayette with an enormous hamper of food and a half-dozen bottles of claret.

Jamie couldnâ€™t eat, but gave the food to Mrs. Macken. He retained a couple of bottles of the wine, though, which heâ€™d opened and kept by him through the day, taking occasional gulps to sustain him as he sponged and watched and prayed.

Judah Bixby came and went like a helpful ghost, appearing and disappearing, but always seeming to be there if something was needed.

â€œThe militia companies . . .â€ Jamie began, but then couldnâ€™t think what heâ€™d meant to ask concerning them. â€œAre they . . . ?â€

â€œMost of them have gone home,â€ Bixby told him, unloading a basket full of beer bottles. â€œTheir enlistment ends on the thirtiethâ€”thatâ€™s tomorrow, sir,â€ he added gently, â€œbut they mostly set off first thing this morning.â€

Jamie let out a breath he hadnâ€™t known he was holding and felt a small measure of peace.

â€œI reckon itâ€™ll be months before anyone knows was it a victory or not,â€ Bixby remarked. He drew the cork from one bottle, then another, and handed one to Jamie. â€œBut it surely wasnâ€™t defeat. Shall we drink to it, sir?â€

Jamie was worn out with worry and praying, but managed a smile for Judah and a quick word of thanks to God for the boy.

Once Judah had left, a somewhat longer prayer on behalf of his nephew. Ian hadnâ€™t returned, and none of Jamieâ€™s visitors had had any word of him. Rachel had come back late the night before, white-faced and silent, and had gone out again at daybreak. Dottie had offered to go with her, but Rachel had refused; the two of them were needed to deal with the wounded still being brought in and those sheltering in the houses and barns of Freehold.

Ian, Jamie thought in anguish, addressing his brother-in-law. For Godâ€™s sake, have an eye to our lad, because I canna do it. Iâ€™m sorry.

Claireâ€™s fever had risen fast during the night, then seemed to fall a little with the coming of the light; she was conscious now and then and capable of a few words, but for the most part she lay in a uneasy doze, her breath coming in shallow pants punctuated by sudden deep, tearing gasps that woke herâ€”she dreamed that she was being suffocated, she said. He would give her as much water as she would take and douse her hair again, and she would drop back into fever dreams, muttering and moaning.

He began to feel as though he were living in a fever dream himself: trapped in endless repetitions of prayer and water, these broken by visitations from some vanished, alien world.

Perhaps this was purgatory, he thought, and gave a wan smile at memory of himself, waking on Culloden Moor so many years ago, his eyelids sealed with blood, thinking himself dead and grateful for it, even if his immediate prospect was a spell in purgatoryâ€”that being a vague, unknown circumstance, probably unpleasant but not one he feared.

He feared the one that might be imminent.

He had come to the conclusion that he couldnâ€™t kill himself, even if she died. Even could he bring himself to commit a sin of that magnitude, there were people who needed him, and to abandon them would be a greater sin even than the willful destruction of Godâ€™s gift of life. But to live without herâ€”he watched her breathe, obsessively, counting ten breaths before he would believe she hadnâ€™t stoppedâ€”that would certainly be his purgatory.

He didnâ€™t think heâ€™d taken his eyes off her, and maybe he hadnâ€™t, but he came out of his reverie to see that her own eyes were open, a soft smudged black in the white of her face. The light had faded to the final cusp of twilight and all color had washed from the room, leaving them in a luminous dusty haze that wasnâ€™t daylight any longer but not yet night. He saw that her hair was nearly dry, curling in masses over the pillow.

â€œIâ€™ve . . . decided . . . not to die,â€ she said, in a voice little more than a whisper.

â€œOh. Good.â€ He was afraid to touch her, for fear of hurting her, but couldnâ€™t bear not to. He laid a hand as lightly as he could over hers, finding it cool in spite of the heat trapped in the small attic.

â€œI could, you know.â€ She closed one eye and looked accusingly at him with the other. â€œI want to; this is . . . bloody horrible.â€

â€œI know,â€ he whispered, and brought her hand to his lips. Her bones were frail, and she hadnâ€™t the strength to squeeze his hand; her fingers lay limp in his.

She closed her eyes and breathed audibly for a little.

â€œDo you know why?â€ she said suddenly, opening her eyes.

â€œNo.â€ Heâ€™d thought of making some jesting remark about her needing to write down her receipt for making ether, but her tone was dead serious, and he didnâ€™t.

â€œBecause,â€ she said, and stopped with a small grimace that squeezed his heart. â€œBecause,â€ she said through clenched teeth, â€œI know what it felt . . . like when I . . . thought you were dead, andâ€”â€ A small gasp for breath, and her eyes locked on his. â€œAnd I wouldnâ€™t do that to you.â€ Her bosom fell and her eyes closed.

It was a long moment before he could speak.

â€œThank ye, Sassenach,â€ he whispered, and held her small, cold hand between his own and watched her breathe until the moon rose.



I COULD SEE the moon through the tiny window; we were in the attic of the house. It was the first breath of the new moon, but the whole of it was visible, a perfect ball of violet and indigo cupped in a sickle of light, luminous among the stars. â€œThe new moon with the old,â€ country folk called it in England. On the Ridge, people called it â€œholding water.â€

The fever had left me. It had also left me drained, light-headed, and weak as a newborn mouse. My side was swollen from hip to oxter, hot and tender to the touch, but I was sure this was only surgical trauma. There wasnâ€™t any significant infection, only a little inflammation near the surface of the incision.

I felt rather like the new moon: the shadow of pain and death was still clearly visible to meâ€”but only because the light was there to throw it into perspective. On the other hand, there were still small practicalities and indignities to be dealt with. I had to pee, and I couldnâ€™t sit up by myself, let alone squat over a chamber pot.

I had no idea what time it was, though with the moon like that, it couldnâ€™t be the middle of the night. The house was still, thoughâ€”Lieutenant Macken had returned safely in late afternoon, bringing with him several other men, but they had been too exhausted for celebration; I could hear faint snoring from the floor below. I couldnâ€™t disturb everyone by calling out for Loretta Mackenâ€™s assistance. With a sigh, I leaned gingerly over the side of the bed and cleared my throat.

â€œSassenach? Are ye all right?â€ A segment of the darkness on the floor moved suddenly and resolved itself into a Jamie-shaped shadow.

â€œYes. Are you?â€

That got me the breath of a laugh.

â€œIâ€™ll do, Sassenach,â€ he said softly, and I heard the rustle of his movement as he got his feet under him. â€œIâ€™m glad ye feel well enough to ask. Dâ€™ye need water?â€

â€œEr . . . rather the opposite, really,â€ I said.

â€œOh? Oh.â€ He stooped, a pale blur in his shirt, to reach under the bed. â€œDâ€™ye need help?â€

â€œIf I didnâ€™t, I wouldnâ€™t have waked you up,â€ I said, a little testily. â€œI didnâ€™t think I could wait for Mrs. Macken or Dottie, though.â€ He snorted a little and got me under the arms, lifting me into a sitting position.



â€œNow, then,â€ he murmured. â€œItâ€™s no like yeâ€™ve not done thisâ€”and a good many worse thingsâ€”for me.â€

While this was true, it didnâ€™t make matters easier.

â€œYou can let go now,â€ I said.

â€œPerhaps leave the room?â€ â€œPerhaps not,â€ he said, still mildly, but with a tone indicating that his mind was made up on the subject. â€œIf I let go, yeâ€™ll fall on your face, and ye ken that perfectly well, so stop talkinâ€™ and be about your business now, aye?â€

It took some timeâ€”anything that put pressure on my abdomen, including the act of urinating, hurt remarkablyâ€”but the business was accomplished and I was eased back down onto the pillow, gasping. Jamie bent and picked up the chamber pot, clearly intending to hurl the contents out the window in customary Edinburgh fashion.

â€œNo, wait!â€ I said. â€œKeep that â€™til morning.â€

He paused.

â€œWhat for?â€ he asked cautiously. Clearly he suspected I might still be unhinged from fever and be contemplating some grossly irrational use of the potâ€™s contents, but he didnâ€™t like to say so, in case I had something logical, if bizarre, in mind. I would have laughed, but it hurt too much.

â€œI need to check, once thereâ€™s light, to be sure thereâ€™s no blood,â€ I said. â€œMy right kidneyâ€™s very sore; I want to be sure thereâ€™s no damage.â€

â€œAh.â€ He set the utensil down carefully and, to my surprise, opened the door and glided out, moving soft-footed as a hunting fox. I heard one squeak as he stepped on a stair tread, but nothing more until a glow betokened his return with a candlestick.

â€œHave a look, then,â€ he said, picking up the pot again and bringing it to me. â€œI kent yeâ€™d just fret about it did ye have to wait for daybreak.â€

He sounded resigned, but this small thoughtfulness brought me close to tears. He heard the catch in my breathing and leaned close, alarmed, bringing the light up to my face.

â€œAre ye all right, Sassenach? Is it bad, then?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said, and wiped my eyes hastily on a corner of the sheet. â€œNoâ€”itâ€”itâ€™s fine. I justâ€”oh, Jamie, I love you!â€ I did give way to tears, then, snuffling and blubbering like an idiot. â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ I said, trying to get hold of myself. â€œIâ€™m all right, thereâ€™s nothing wrong, itâ€™s justâ€”â€

â€œAye, I ken fine what itâ€™s just,â€ he said, and, setting the candle and pot on the floor, lay down on the bed beside me, balancing precariously on the edge.

â€œYeâ€™re hurt, a nighean,â€ he said softly, smoothing my hair off my wet cheeks. â€œAnd fevered and starved and worn to a shadow. Thereâ€™s no much of ye left, is there, poor wee thing?â€

I shook my head and clung to him. â€œThereâ€™s not much of you left, either,â€ I managed to say, mumbling wetly into the front of his shirt.

He made a small amused noise and rubbed my back, very gently. â€œEnough, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m enough. For now.â€

I sighed and fumbled under the pillow for a hankie to blow my nose.

â€œBetter?â€ he asked, sitting up.

â€œYes. Donâ€™t go, though.â€ I put a hand on his leg, hard and warm under my hand. â€œCan you lie with me a minute? Iâ€™m awfully cold.â€ I was, though I realized from the damp and salt on his skin that the room was quite hot. But loss of so much blood had left me chilled and gasping; I couldnâ€™t get through a sentence without stopping to breathe, and my arms were permanently goose-pimpled.

â€œAye. Dinna move; Iâ€™ll go round.â€ He came round the bed and edged carefully in behind me. It was a narrow bed, barely wide enough to hold us closely pressed together.

I exhaled gingerly and relaxed against him in slow motion, reveling in the feel of his warmth and the solid comfort of his body.

â€œElephants,â€ I said, drawing the shallowest possible breath compatible with speaking. â€œWhen a female elephant is dying, sometimes a male will try to mate with her.â€

There was a marked silence behind me, and then a big hand came round and rested assessingly on my forehead.

â€œEither yeâ€™re fevered again, Sassenach,â€ he said in my ear, â€œor ye have verra perverse fancies. Ye dinna really want me toâ€”â€

â€œNo,â€ I said hastily. â€œNot right this minute, no. And Iâ€™m not dying, either. The thought just came to me.â€

He made an amused Scottish noise and, lifting the hair off my neck, kissed my nape.

â€œSince yeâ€™re no dying,â€ he said, â€œmaybe that will do for the moment?â€

I took his hand and placed it on my breast. Slowly I grew warmer, and my chilly feet, pressed against his shins, relaxed. The window now was filled with stars, hazy with the moistness of the summer night, and I suddenly missed the cool, clear, black-velvet nights of the mountains, the stars blazing huge, close enough to touch from the highest ridge.

â€œJamie?â€ I whispered. â€œCan we go home? Please?â€

â€œAye,â€ he said softly. He held my hand and the silence filled the room like moonlight, both of us wondering where home might be.





A WHIFF OF ROQUEFORT

I HADNâ€™T SEEN ANY of the previous dayâ€™s flock of visitors, though Jamie had told me about them. This day, though, brought one for me. Mrs. Macken brought him up the stairs, in spite of her advanced state of pregnancy, and showed him into my tiny room with great respect.

He wasnâ€™t in uniform and wasâ€”for himâ€”quite subfusc, in a coat and breeches of the dull gray that was referred to (with accuracy) as â€œsad-colored,â€ though he had taken the trouble to wear a dove-gray waistcoat with it that flattered his coloring.

â€œHow are you, my dear?â€ he asked, taking off his hat. Not waiting for an answer, he came down on one knee by the bed, took my hand, and kissed it lightly. His blond hair had been washed, I sawâ€”I smelled his bergamot soapâ€”and trimmed to a uniform length. As that length was roughly an inch, the overall effect reminded me irresistibly of a fuzzy duckling. I laughed, then gasped and pressed a hand to my side.

â€œDinna make her laugh!â€ Jamie said, glowering at John. His tone was cold, but I saw him take in Johnâ€™s aspect, and the corner of his own mouth twitched.

â€œI know,â€ John said ruefully to me, passing a hand over his head and ignoring Jamie completely. â€œIsnâ€™t it dreadful? I ought really to wear a wig for the sake of public decency, but I couldnâ€™t bear it in the heat.â€

â€œDonâ€™t know that I blame you,â€ I told him, and ran a hand through the damp mass of my own hair, drying on my shoulders. â€œThough I havenâ€™t yet got to the point of wanting to shave my head,â€ I added pointedly, not quite turning my head toward Jamie.

â€œDonâ€™t. It wouldnâ€™t suit you at all,â€ John assured me.

â€œHow is your eye?â€ I asked, gingerly trying to raise myself on the pillow. â€œLet me have a look at it.â€

â€œStay there,â€ he said, and, leaning over me, opened both eyes wide. â€œI think itâ€™s quite good. Itâ€™s still a bit tender to the touch and gets the odd twinge when I move it too far up or to the right, butâ€”do you smell French cheese?â€ He sounded slightly startled.

â€œMmm.â€ I was gently prodding the flesh around the orbit, which showed only a slight residual swelling. The sclera was still quite bloodshot, but the bruising was much better. I thumbed down the lower lid to inspect the conjunctiva: a nice slippery pink, no sign of infection. â€œDoes it water?â€

â€œOnly in strong sunlight, and not very much,â€ he assured me, straightening up. He smiled at me. â€œThank you, my dear.â€

Jamie didnâ€™t say anything, but the way he breathed had a distinctly edgy feel about it. I ignored him. If he chose to make a fuss, I couldnâ€™t bloody stop him.

â€œWhat are ye doing here?â€ he asked abruptly. John looked up at him, one brow raised, as though surprised to see him looming on the other side of my bed. John rose slowly to his feet, holding Jamieâ€™s eyes with his own.

â€œWhat do you think Iâ€™m doing?â€ he asked quietly. There was no hint of challenge in the question, and I could see Jamie suddenly check his own hostility, frowning slightly as he looked John over, considering.

One side of Johnâ€™s mouth turned up a little.

â€œDo you think Iâ€™ve come to fight you for the favors of this lady? Or to seduce her from your side?â€

Jamie didnâ€™t laugh, but the line between his brows smoothed out.

â€œI donâ€™t,â€ he said dryly. â€œAnd as ye dinna seem to be much damaged, I doubt yeâ€™ve come to be doctored.â€

John gave an amiable bob of the head, indicating that this line of reasoning was correct.



â€œAnd I doubt, as well,â€ Jamie continued, an edge creeping into his voice, â€œthat yeâ€™ve come to continue our previous discussion.â€

John inhaled slowly, and exhaled even slower, regarding Jamie with a level gaze. â€œIs it your opinion that anything remains to be said, regarding any part of that discussion?â€

There was a marked silence. I glanced from one to the other, Jamieâ€™s eyes narrowed and Johnâ€™s eyes wide, both with fixed blue stares. All it lacked was growling and the slow lashing of tails.

â€œAre you armed, John?â€ I inquired pleasantly.

He glanced at me, startled. â€œNo.â€

â€œGood,â€ I said, grunting slightly as I struggled to sit up. â€œThen you obviously arenâ€™t going to kill himâ€â€”I nodded at Jamie, standing over me with fists half curledâ€”â€œand if he didnâ€™t break your neck the first time, he isnâ€™t going to do it now. Are you?â€ I inquired, arching a brow at Jamie.

He looked down his nose at me, but I saw the slight relaxation of his mouth. And his hands. â€œProbably not.â€

â€œWell, then.â€ I brushed the hair back from my face. â€œNo point in hitting each other. And harsh language would detract from the pleasant nature of this visit, wouldnâ€™t it?â€

Neither of them chose to answer this.

â€œThat was not actually a rhetorical question,â€ I said. â€œBut let that go.â€ I turned to John, folding my hands in my lap. â€œFlattered as I am by the attention, I donâ€™t think you came solely to inquire after my well-being. So if youâ€™ll pardon my vulgar curiosity . . . why are you here?â€

He finally relaxed and, at my nod, took the stool, linking his fingers round his knee.

â€œIâ€™ve come to ask your help,â€ he said directly to Jamie. â€œBut alsoâ€â€”it was slight, but I noticed the hesitationâ€”â€œto make you an offer. Not as quid pro quo,â€ he added. â€œThe offer is not contingent on your assistance.â€

Jamie made a Scottish noise indicating deep skepticism but willingness to listen.

John nodded and took a breath before continuing. â€œYou once mentioned to me, my dear, thatâ€”â€

â€œDinna be calling her that.â€

â€œMrs. Fraser,â€ John amended, and, with a polite bow to me, turned his attention to Jamie, â€œonce mentioned that sheâ€”and you, I would imagineâ€”had some acquaintance with General Arnold.â€

Jamie and I exchanged puzzled looks. He shrugged and folded his arms.

â€œAye, we do.â€

â€œGood. What Iâ€”and my brotherâ€â€”I felt, rather than saw, Jamieâ€™s start at mention of Halâ€”â€œwould ask of you is a note of introduction to Arnold, with your personal request that the general allow us official entrance into the cityâ€”and whatever aid he might find it convenient to give usâ€”for the purpose of making a search for my son.â€

John let out the rest of his breath and sat, head down, not moving. Nobody moved.

At last, Jamie let out a long sigh and sat down on the roomâ€™s other stool.

â€œTell me,â€ he said, resigned. â€œWhatâ€™s the wee bastard done now?â€





THE STORY FINISHED, John inhaled, made to rub his bad eye, and luckily stopped in time.

â€œIâ€™ll put a bit more honey in that before you leave,â€ I told him. â€œIt will ease the grittiness.â€ This non sequitur helped to bridge the awkward gap in the conversation left by Jamieâ€™s being struck momentarily speechless.

â€œJesus,â€ he said, and rubbed a hand hard over his face. He was still wearing the bloodstained shirt and breeches in which heâ€™d fought; he hadnâ€™t shaved in three days, had barely slept or eaten, and looked like something you wouldnâ€™t want to meet in broad daylight, let alone a dark alley. He took a deep breath and shook his head like a dog shedding water.

â€œSo ye think the two of them have gone to Philadelphiaâ€”William and this Richardson?â€

â€œProbably not togetherâ€”or at least not to begin with,â€ John said. â€œWilliamâ€™s groom said he left to find a couple of . . . er . . . girls who had gone from the camp. But we strongly suspect that this was a ploy by Richardson, to decoy William out of camp and intercept him on the road.â€

Jamie made an irascible noise.

â€œI should like to think the ladâ€™s no such a fat-heided gomerel as to go off wiâ€™ this Richardson. Not after the man sent him into the Great Dismal last year and nearly killed him.â€

â€œHe told you that?â€

â€œOh. He didna tell ye that?â€ Jamieâ€™s voice might possibly have held a shade of scorn, had one been listening closely.

â€œIâ€™m damned sure he didnâ€™t tell you anything,â€ John replied, with an edge. â€œHe hadnâ€™t seen you for years before he met you at Chestnut Street, Iâ€™d bet money he hasnâ€™t seen you since, and Iâ€™m reasonably sure I would have noticed had he mentioned Richardson in the hallway there.â€

â€œNo,â€ Jamie said briefly. â€œHe told my nephew, Ian Murray. Or at least,â€ he amended, â€œIan got it from what he said, raving wiâ€™ fever when Ian got him out of the swamp. Richardson sent him wiâ€™ a message for some men in Dismal Townâ€”men he said were Loyalists. But half the men in Dismal Town are named Washington.â€

Johnâ€™s appearance of pugnacity had vanished. He looked pale, and the fading bruises stood out like leprosy against his skin. He took a deep breath, glanced round the room, and, seeing a half-empty bottle of claret on the table, picked it up and drank a quarter of it without stopping.

He set it down, stifled a belch, rose with a brief nod and a â€œwait a moment,â€ and went out, leaving Jamie and me staring at each other in bafflement.

This was not significantly assuaged by the reappearance of John, followed by the Duke of Pardloe. Jamie said something remarkably creative in GÃ idhlig, and I gave him a look of startled appreciation.

â€œAnd a good day to you, too, General Fraser,â€ Hal said, with a correct bow. Like John, he was dressed in civvies, though with a rather loud mulberry striped waistcoat, and I did wonder where heâ€™d got it from.

â€œI have resigned my commission,â€ Jamie said coldly. â€œ â€˜Mr. Fraserâ€™ will do. May I ask to what we owe the honor of your presence, Your Grace?â€



Halâ€™s lips pressed tight together, but, with a glance at his brother, he obliged with a brief prÃ©cis of his personal concern with Captain Richardson.

â€œAnd I do, of course, wish to retrieve my nephew, Williamâ€”should he in fact be with Richardson. My brother informs me that you have doubts as to the probability of this being the case?â€

â€œI do,â€ Jamie said shortly. â€œMy son is not a fool, nor a weakling.â€ I caught the faint emphasis on â€œmy son,â€ and so did both Greys, who stiffened slightly. â€œHe wouldna go off on some feeble pretext, nor would he allow someone of whom he was suspicious to take him captive.â€

â€œYou have a bloody lot of faith in a boy you havenâ€™t seen since he was six,â€ Hal observed conversationally.

Jamie smiled, with considerable rue.

â€œI had the making of him until he was six,â€ he said, and turned his gaze on John. â€œI ken what heâ€™s made of. And I ken who shaped him after that. Tell me Iâ€™m wrong, my lord.â€

There was a marked silence, broken only by Lieutenant Mackenâ€™s voice below, calling plaintively to his wife about the location of his clean stockings.

â€œWell, then,â€ Hal said with a sigh. â€œWhere do you think Williamâ€™s gone, if heâ€™s not with Richardson?â€

â€œHeâ€™s gone after the girls he spoke of,â€ Jamie said, lifting one shoulder in a shrug. â€œHe told his groom so, did he not? Dâ€™ye ken who these lassies are?â€

The Greys exchanged looks of muted chagrin, and I coughed, very carefully, holding a pillow to my stomach.

â€œIf thatâ€™s the case,â€ I said, â€œthen presumably heâ€™ll come back, once heâ€™s either found them or given up looking for them. Wouldnâ€™t he? Would he go AWOL over themâ€”er . . . absent without leave, I mean?â€

â€œHe wouldnâ€™t have to risk that,â€ Hal said. â€œHeâ€™s been relieved of duty.â€

â€œWhat?â€ John exclaimed, rounding on his brother. â€œWhat the devil for?â€

Hal sighed, exasperated. â€œLeaving camp when he was ordered to stay there in the middle of a battle, what else? Getting into a fight with another officer, ending up at the bottom of a ravine with a dent in his skull through being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and in general being a bloody nuisance.â€

â€œYouâ€™re right, he is your son,â€ I said to Jamie, amused. He snorted, but didnâ€™t look altogether displeased.

â€œSpeaking of nephews,â€ Jamie said to Hal, â€œye seem remarkably well informed, Your Grace. Might ye know anything of an Indian scout named Ian Murray?â€

Hal looked blank, but Johnâ€™s head turned quickly in Jamieâ€™s direction.

â€œYes,â€ he said. â€œI do. He was taken prisoner late on the day of battle and walked with me into camp, whereupon he killed another scout with a tomahawk and walked out again.â€

â€œBlood will tell,â€ I murmured, though privately both shocked and worried. â€œEr . . . was he injured?â€

â€œAye, he was,â€ Jamie answered brusquely. â€œHeâ€™d been shot wiâ€™ an arrow, in the shoulder. I couldna pull it, but I broke the shaft for him.â€

â€œAnd . . . no oneâ€™s seen him since the night of the battle?â€ I asked, striving to keep my voice steady. The men exchanged glances, but none of them would meet my eyes.

â€œI, um, did give him a canteen of water mixed with brandy,â€ John said, a little diffidently. â€œHe wouldnâ€™t take a horse.â€

â€œRachel will find him,â€ Jamie said, as firmly as he could. â€œAnd Iâ€™ve asked Ian MÃ²r to watch out for the lad. Heâ€™ll be all right.â€

â€œI trust your faith in your blood will be justified, sir,â€ Hal said with a sigh, evidently meaning it. â€œBut as we can do nothing about Murray, and the question of Williamâ€™s whereabouts is apparently moot for the moment . . . I hesitate to intrude my concerns regarding my blood, but I have stringent reasons for finding Captain Richardson, quite apart from anything he may have done or not done with William. And to that end . . .â€

â€œAye,â€ Jamie said, and the tension in his shoulders relaxed. â€œAye, of course, Your Grace. Sassenach, will ye have the goodness not to die whilst I go and ask Mrs. Macken for paper and ink?â€

â€œWe have some,â€ John said, reaching into the leather pouch heâ€™d been carrying under his arm. â€œAllow me.â€ And proceeded to lay out paper, an inkhorn, a small bundle of quills, and a stub of red sealing wax.

Everyone watched as Jamie mixed the ink, trimmed a quill, and began. Knowing how laborious writing was for him and how much heâ€™d hate being watched, I pushed myself up a little more, stifling a groan, and turned to Hal.

â€œJohn mentioned that you wanted to make us an offer,â€ I said. â€œOf course weâ€™re happy to help, regardless. But out of curiosityâ€”â€

â€œOh.â€ Hal blinked but changed gears rapidly, fixing his gaze on me. â€œYes. The offer I had in mind has nothing to do with Mr. Fraserâ€™s kind accommodation,â€ he said. â€œJohn suggested it, as a matter of convenience for all concerned.â€ He turned to his brother, who smiled at me.

â€œMy house on Chestnut Street,â€ John said. â€œPlainly I shanâ€™t be living there for the foreseeable future. And I understand that you had taken refuge with the printerâ€™s family in Philadelphia. Given your present fragile state of healthâ€â€”he nodded delicately at the small heap of bloody dressings in the cornerâ€”â€œclearly it would be more comfortable for you to resume residence at my house. Youâ€”â€

A deep Scottish noise interrupted him, and he looked up at Jamie, startled.

â€œThe last time I was compelled to accept assistance from your brother, my lord,â€ Jamie said precisely, staring at John, â€œI was your prisoner and incapable of caring for my own family. Now I am no manâ€™s prisoner, nor ever will be again. I shall make provision for my wife.â€

In dead silence, with all eyes fixed on him, he bent his head to the paper and slowly signed his name.





ONE DAY, COCK OF THE WALKâ€”NEXT DAY, A FEATHER DUSTER

HEâ€™D GONE BY INSTINCT to fetch Madras, but paused to think on the way. If he found the girls, he couldnâ€™t bring them both back with him on the horse. He changed direction and plunged into the teamstersâ€™ park, emerging a brief time later with an ammunition cart, now sans ammunition, pulled by a large, rugged gray mule with half of one ear missing.

The mule was disinclined to move fast, but still made better time than two girls on foot might. How long a head start did they have? Maybe an hour, from what Zebedee had said, maybe longer.

â€œHeya!â€ he shouted, and snapped the whip over the muleâ€™s rump. The animal was surly, but not a fool, and lurched into a faster paceâ€”though William suspected that this effort might be as much to outrun the swarming flies as in response to his own urging.

Once solidly in motion, though, the mule seemed able to keep it up without noticeable effort, and they trotted down the road at a tooth-rattling pace, easily passing farm carts, foragers, and a couple of scouting parties. Surely he would catch the girls up in no time.

He didnâ€™t. He drove nearly ten miles, by his estimation, before concluding that there was no way the girls could possibly have outrun him, and he turned back, searching carefully along the few farm roads that led off into fields. To and fro he went, inquiring of everyone he saw, growing hotter and more irritated by the moment.

Midway through the afternoon, the army caught up with him, marching columns overtaking the mule, which had slowed to a walk by now. Reluctantly, he turned about and continued with the army to camp. Perhaps Colenso had been wrong; maybe the girls hadnâ€™t left at all. In which case, heâ€™d find them once the camp settled for the night.

He did not. He did find Zeb, though, and Colenso with him. Both were adamant that the girls were indeed goneâ€”and William found no trace of them, though he made stubborn inquiries among the laundresses and cooks.

At last, he trudged through the camp in search of either Papa or Uncle Hal. Not that he expected either man to have any notion regarding the girlsâ€”but he somehow felt that he could not abandon his search without at least soliciting their help in putting out word of the girls. Two half-grown girls couldnâ€™t possibly outstrip an army, andâ€”



He stopped dead in the middle of camp, letting men on their way to supper flow around him.

â€œBloody hell,â€ he said, too hot and tired even to make it an exclamation. â€œColenso, you left-handed little bugger.â€ And barely containing his exasperationâ€”with himself as much as with his groomâ€”he set off grimly to find Colenso Baragwanath.

Because Colenso was a left-handed little bugger. William had noticed that immediately, as he suffered from the same affliction himself. Unlike Colenso, though, William could tell the difference between his right hand and his leftâ€”and had a sense of direction. Colenso . . . didnâ€™t, and William wanted to kick himself for not remembering that.

â€œYou bloody idiot,â€ he muttered, wiping a sleeve across his sweating, dusty face. â€œWhy didnâ€™t you think of that?â€

Because it made little senseâ€”once he paused to think about itâ€”for the girls to have run off ahead of the army. Even if they were afraid of someone in the army, and even if they meant to reach New York, they would have been better served to have gone the other way, at least temporarily. Let the army march on well ahead, and then make their way wherever they meant to go.

He glanced at the sun, just barely still above the horizon, and heaved a deep, exasperated breath. Whatever else she might be, Jane wasnâ€™t a fool. First heâ€™d find some supper, and then Colensoâ€”but heâ€™d give good odds that the morrow would find him on the road back toward Middletown.



HE FOUND THEM, just before noon. They saw him coming, but heâ€™d seen them first: the two of them walking down the side of the road, each with a bundle in either hand. They glanced over their shoulders at the sound of his wheels, saw nothing alarming, turned backâ€”and then Jane whirled round again, her face aghast as she realized who sheâ€™d just seen.

She dropped one of her bundles, clutched her younger sister by the wrist, and jerked her off the road. The road led through farmland here, with open fields on either sideâ€”but there was a sizable chestnut grove a few hundred yards ahead, and, despite Williamâ€™s shout, the girls ran for this as though the devil himself were after them.

Muttering under his breath, he pulled up, dropped the reins, and leapt out. Long-legged as he was, he failed to catch them before they reached the edge of the wood.

â€œStop, for Godâ€™s sake!â€ he bellowed. â€œIâ€™m not going to hurt you!â€

Fanny, hearing this, seemed disposed to stop, but Jane yanked her urgently on and they vanished among the rustling leaves.

William snorted and slowed down. Jane could make up her own mindâ€”if she had one, which he was strongly inclined to doubt at the momentâ€”but she hadnâ€™t any business to be dragging her little sister off through land that had been a battlefield only two days ago.

Broken trails and big crushed patches marred the fields, from soldiers running or artillery being dragged through it. He could smell death when he drew a deep breath; it made him uneasy. The stink of uncollected corpses swelling in the sun, bursting open, weltering with flies and maggots . . . On the one hand, he hoped the girls wouldnâ€™t stumble over such a sight. On the other, if they did, theyâ€™d likely come haring back out into his arms, screaming.

And corpses might not be the only things hiding in the folds and furrows of the countryside. His hand went automatically to his waist, groping for the hilt of his knifeâ€”which, of course, wasnâ€™t there.

â€œFucking buggering shit-fucking hell!â€

As though this had been a signal, a sudden racket broke out in the trees. Not a corpse; he could hear male voices, cursing, cajoling, and high-pitched shrieks. He snatched up a fallen branch and charged into the grove, shouting at the top of his lungs. He could hear them; they could certainly hear him, and the tone of the shouting changed. The girls were still shrieking, but less frantically, and the menâ€”yes, more than one . . . two, three? Not moreâ€”were arguing, agitated, fearful. Not English . . . not speaking English . . .

â€œMistkerle!â€ he bellowed at the top of his lungs. Bloody stinking Hessians! â€œFeiglinge!â€ Shit-eating cowards!

A great thrashing of leaves and snapping branches, and, peering through the trees, he saw that the lot of themâ€”judging by the noise, the girls were still with themâ€”were heading for the road.

He stopped yelling and instantly altered his own course, charging back toward the road, crashing heedless through brush and low-hanging branches, half-ripe chestnuts thumping off his head and shoulders. There! He saw a man push out of the trees, stumbling onto the road, and lunge back, grabbing. A louder shriek and Fanny came stumbling out in turn, the man gripping her by the neck.

William veered toward them and burst out running, shouting incoherent curses, brandishing his makeshift club. He must nonetheless have looked frightening in his uniform, for the man holding Fanny let go of her at once, turned, and ran like a rabbit, dust spurting from his feet. Fanny staggered and fell to her knees, but there was no blood, she was all right. . . .

â€œJane!â€ He shouted. â€œJane! Where are you?â€

â€œHere! Heâ€”â€ Her voice was cut off suddenly, but he could see where she was, no more than ten feet from him, and dived for the wildly waving branches.

There were two men with her, one with a hand over her mouth, the other struggling to detach the bayonet from a brown Bess musket. William kicked the gun out of his hands, then lunged at the man, and in moments was on the ground, grappling with a burly man who might not know what to do with a bayonet but certainly was acquainted with battle of a more primitive sort.

They rolled to and fro, panting and gouging, twigs breaking with a sound like gunshots, cracking beneath their bodies. He heard dimly a screech from the other manâ€”perhaps Jane had bitten him; good girl!â€”but had no attention to spare for anything but the man who was trying earnestly to throttle him. He had a grip on the manâ€™s wrists, and, with a faint memory of Ban Tarleton, jerked the man closer and butted him in the face.

It worked again; there was a horrible crunch, hot blood spattered his face, and the manâ€™s grip relaxed. William squirmed away, his head swimming, only to find himself facing the other man, who had evidently succeeded in freeing the bayonet, for he had a foot of sharpened steel in his hand.

â€œHere! Here!â€ Jane popped out of a bush right beside William, startling him, and shoved something into his hand. It was, thank God, a knife. Nothing to rival the bayonet, but a weapon.

Jane was still by him; he grasped her arm and began to walk backward, knife held low and threatening in his other hand. The Hessianâ€”Christ, was it one of the sons of bitches whoâ€™d hit him in the head? He couldnâ€™t tell; there were spots floating in front of his eyes, and the men had thrown away their telltale green coats. Did all sons of bitches wear green coats? he wondered muzzily.

Then they were on the road, and things became confused. He thought heâ€™d stuck one of the men, and the girls were screaming again, and once he found himself in the roadway, choking on dust, but came up again before one of the bastards could kick him in the face . . . and then there was a shout and the pounding of hooves, and he let go of the man whose arm he was gripping and whirled round to see Rachel Hunter on a mule, coming fast down the road, swinging her bonnet from its strings and shouting, â€œUncle Hiram! Cousin Seth! Hurry! Come on! Come on! Help me!â€

His mule jerked its head up from the grass and, seeing Rachelâ€™s mount, brayed in greeting. This seemed to be the last straw for the deserters, who stood gaping for one stunned moment, then turned and galloped down the road after their vanished fellow.

William stood swaying for a moment, gasping for breath, then dropped his knife and sat down abruptly.

â€œWhat,â€ he said, in a voice that sounded petulant even to his own ears, â€œare you doing here?â€

Rachel ignored him. She swung down from her mule, landing with a small thump, and led it to Williamâ€™s mule, tethering it to the cart. Only then did she walk over to where William sat, slowly brushing dirt from his knees and counting his limbs.

â€œYou wouldnâ€™t happen to have seen a couple of girls, would you?â€ he asked, tilting his head back to look up at Rachel.

â€œYes. They ran into the trees,â€ she said, nodding toward the chestnut grove. â€œAs for what I am doing here, I have been up and down this road three times, looking for thy cousin, Ian Murray.â€ She gave him a hard look as she said this, as though daring him to contradict her assertion regarding his kinship with Murray. Under other circumstances, he might have taken offense, but at the moment he hadnâ€™t the energy. â€œI assume that if thee had seen him, dead or alive, thee would tell me?â€

â€œYes,â€ he said. There was a swollen knot between his eyes, where he had butted the deserter, and he rubbed this gingerly.

She drew a deep breath, sighed loudly, and wiped her sweating face on her apron, before replacing her bonnet. She looked him over, shaking her head.

â€œThee is a rooster, William,â€ Rachel said mournfully. â€œI saw this in thee before, but now I know it for certain.â€

â€œA rooster,â€ he repeated coldly, brushing dirt from his sleeve. â€œIndeed. A vain, crowing, gaudy sort of fellowâ€”thatâ€™s what you think me?â€



Her brows went up. They were not the level brows of classic beauty; they quirked up at the ends, even when her face was at rest, giving her a look of interested intelligence. When she was not at rest, they slanted with a sharp, wicked sort of look. They did this for an instant now, but then relaxed. A little.

â€œNo,â€ she said. â€œHas thee ever kept chickens, William?â€

â€œNot for some years,â€ he said, examining the hole torn in the elbow of his coat, the hole ripped in the shirt beneath, and the bloody scrape upon his bare elbow. Bloody hell, one of the buggers had come close to taking his arm off with that bayonet. â€œWhat with one thing and another, my recent acquaintance with chickens has been limited largely to breakfast. Why?â€

â€œWhy, a rooster is a creature of amazing courage,â€ Rachel said, rather reproachful. â€œHe will throw himself into the face of an enemy, even knowing he will die in the attack, and thus buy his hens time to escape.â€

Williamâ€™s head jerked up.

â€œMy hens?â€ he said, outrage bringing the blood to his face. â€œMy hens?â€ He glanced in the direction Jane and Fanny had taken, then glared back at Rachel. â€œDo you not realize that they are whores?â€

She rolled her eyes at him in exasperation. She bloody rolled her eyes at him!

â€œI expect I have been living with an army for somewhat longer than thee has thyself,â€ she said, making a decided effort to look down her nose at him. â€œI am familiar with women who lack both property and protection and are thus reduced to the dreadful expedient of selling their bodies, yes.â€

â€œâ€˜Dreadful expedientâ€™?â€ he repeated. â€œYou realize that Iâ€”â€

She stamped a foot and glared at him.

â€œWill thee stop repeating everything I say?â€ she demanded. â€œI was attempting to pay thee a complimentâ€”while, as thy friend, lamenting the end thy roosterishness will surely bring thee to. Whether thy companions are whores or notâ€”and whether thee pays for their companyâ€”is irrelevant to the matter.â€

â€œIrreâ€”â€ William began in indignation, but choked the word off before he could be further accused of repetition. â€œI donâ€™t bloody pay them!â€

â€œIrrelevant,â€ she repeated, doing it herself, by God! â€œThee has behaved in exactly the same way on my own behalf, after all.â€

â€œYouâ€”â€ He stopped abruptly. â€œI have?â€

She exhaled strongly, eyeing him in a manner suggesting that she would have kicked him in the shins or stamped on his toes if not reminded of her Quaker principles.

â€œTwice,â€ she said, elaborately polite. â€œThe occasions were so negligible, I supposeâ€”or I wasâ€”that thee has forgotten?â€

â€œRemind me,â€ he said dryly, and, ripping a chunk from the torn lining of his coat, used it to wipe the mudâ€”and blood, he sawâ€”from his face.

She snorted briefly, but obliged. â€œDoes thee not recall the odious creature who attacked us in that dreadful place on the road in New York?â€

â€œOh, that.â€ His belly clenched in recollection. â€œI didnâ€™t exactly do it on your account. Nor did I have much choice in the matter. He bloody tried to cave my head in with an ax.â€



â€œHmph. I think thee has some fatal attraction for ax-wielding maniacs,â€ she said, frowning at him. â€œThat Mr. Bug actually did hit thee in the head with an ax. But when thee killed him later, it was to protect Ian and me from a similar fate, was it not?â€

â€œOh, indeed,â€ he said, a little crossly. â€œHow do you know it wasnâ€™t just revenge for his attacking me?â€

â€œThee may be a rooster, but thee is not a vengeful rooster,â€ she said reprovingly. She pulled a kerchief from her pocket and blotted her face, which was growing shiny with perspiration again. â€œShould we not look for thy . . . companions?â€

â€œWe should,â€ he said, with a degree of resignation, and turned toward the grove. â€œI think theyâ€™ll run if I go in after them, though.â€

Rachel made an impatient noise and, pushing past him, stomped into the woods, rustling through the brush like a hungry bear. The thought made him grin, but a sudden yelp wiped the smile off his face. He started after her, but she was already backing out, yanking Jane by one arm, meanwhile trying to avoid the wild swipes Jane was making with her free hand, fingers clawed and slashing toward Rachelâ€™s face.

â€œStop that!â€ William said sharply, and, stepping forward, grabbed Jane by the shoulder and jerked her out of Rachelâ€™s grasp. She turned blindly on him, but he had longer arms than Rachel and could easily hold her at bay.

â€œWill you quit that?â€ he said crossly. â€œNo oneâ€™s going to hurt you. Not now.â€

She did stop, though she looked back and forth between him and Rachel like a cornered animal, panting and the whites of her eyes showing.

â€œHeâ€™s right,â€ Rachel said, edging cautiously toward her. â€œThee is quite safe now. What is thy name, Friend?â€

â€œSheâ€™s called Jane,â€ William said, gradually loosing his hold, ready to grab her again if she bolted. â€œI donâ€™t know her surname.â€

She didnâ€™t bolt, but didnâ€™t speak, either. Her dress was torn at the neck, and she put a hand to the torn edge automatically, trying to fit it back in place.

â€œHave you seen my bundle?â€ she said, in an almost ordinary voice. â€œI have a housewife in it. I need a needle.â€

â€œIâ€™ll look for it,â€ Rachel said soothingly. â€œDid thee drop it in the wood?â€

â€œThir!â€ Fanny spoke quite sharply behind William, and he became aware that sheâ€™d been there for a few moments; sheâ€™d said it once or twice before.

â€œWhat?â€ he said impatiently, half-turning toward her while trying to keep both Jane and Rachel in view.

â€œThereâ€™th an Indian in there,â€ she said, and pointed toward the woods.

â€œIan!â€

Rachel ran across the road, fleet as a snipe, and vanished into the trees. William followed hastily, hand on his knife. There was likely more than one Indian in these woods, and if it wasnâ€™t Murray . . .

But he could tell from Rachelâ€™s exclamation of mingled horror and relief from the depths of the wood that it was.

Murray was crumpled into a heap in the deep shadow at the base of a big pine tree, needles half-scuffled over him; evidently heâ€™d tried to disguise himself but had passed out before managing the job.



â€œHeâ€™s breathing,â€ Rachel said, and he heard the catch in her voice.

â€œGood,â€ William said briefly, and, squatting beside her, put a hand on Murrayâ€™s shoulder to turn him over. The apparently insensible body gave a shriek, contorted violently, and ended on his knees, swaying and glaring wildly round, clutching the shoulder William had seized. Only then did William see the dried blood streaked down the arm and the fresh dribbles running down from the broken shaft of an arrow embedded in the swollen flesh.

â€œIan,â€ Rachel said. â€œIan, itâ€™s me. Itâ€™s all right now. I have thee.â€ Her voice was steady, but her hand trembled as she touched him.

Murray gulped air, and his bleared gaze seemed to clear, traveling from Fanny and Jane, who had come into the grove after William, pausing briefly with a frown at Williamâ€™s face, then settling and easing as he saw Rachel. He closed his eyes and let out a long breath.

â€œTaing do Dhia,â€ he said, and sank back on his haunches.

â€œWater,â€ Rachel said urgently, shaking the empty canteen that lay on the ground beside Ian. â€œHas thee got any water, William?â€

â€œI have,â€ said Jane, stirring out of her trance and groping for the canteen round her neck. â€œWill he be all right, do you think?â€

Rachel didnâ€™t answer but helped Murray to drink, her face pale with anxiety. Murrayâ€™s own face bore the remnants of war paint, William saw with interest, and a brief ripple raised the hairs on his scalp, wondering whether Murray had killed any of the British soldiers. At least the bugger wasnâ€™t sporting any scalps on his belt, British or otherwise.

Rachel was conversing now in low tones with Murray, glancing now and then at William, a certain speculation in her gaze.

William was mildly surprised to find that he knew exactly what she was thinking. Though perhaps it wasnâ€™t so surprising; heâ€™d been wondering much the same thing: could Murray ride the mule? Plainly he couldnâ€™t walk far. And if he couldnâ€™t . . . could Rachel persuade William to take Murray and her into the city in the wagon?

He felt his stomach clench at the thought of going back to Philadelphia.

His own gaze flicked toward Janeâ€”only to discover that she wasnâ€™t there. Neither was Fanny.

He was halfway to his feet when he heard Rachelâ€™s mule bray in protest, and he made it to the road in seconds, to find Jane engaged in a futile struggle to push Fanny up into the saddle. The younger girl was trying valiantly, clutching at the muleâ€™s bristly mane and attempting to get a leg up, but the mule was objecting strenuously to this sort of interference, tossing his head and backing away from Jane, leaving Fannyâ€™s legs kicking desperately in the air.

William reached her in three paces and clasped her about the waist.

â€œLet go, sweetheart,â€ he said calmly. â€œIâ€™ve got you.â€ Fanny was surprisingly solid, given her fragile appearance. She smelled sweet, too, though her neck was grubby and her clothes grimed with mud and road dust.

He put her down and turned a firm eye on Jane, who was looking defiant. Heâ€™d been acquainted with her long enough now, though, to see that the uplifted chin and tight jaw were covering fear, and, in consequence, spoke more gently than he might have.

â€œWhere were you planning to go?â€ he asked, in a tone of mild interest.



â€œIâ€”well, New York,â€ she answered, but uncertainly, and her eyes were darting to and fro, as though expecting some threat to manifest itself from the peaceful countryside.

â€œWithout me? Iâ€™m hurt, madam, that you should have conceived a sudden dislike of my company. What have I done to offend you, pray?â€

She pressed her lips tight together, but he could see that his jesting tone had settled her a little; she was still red in the face from exertion, but not breathing in that jerky way.

â€œI think we must part, Lord Ellesmere,â€ she said, with a touchingly absurd attempt at formality. â€œIâ€”weâ€”shall make our own way now.â€

He folded his arms, leaned back against the wagon, and looked down his nose at her.

â€œHow?â€ he inquired. â€œYou havenâ€™t any money, you donâ€™t have a mount, and you wouldnâ€™t get five miles on foot without running into someone else like those German fellows.â€

â€œIâ€”have a little money.â€ She smoothed a hand over her skirt, and he saw that there was indeed a bulge where her pocket lay. Despite his intent to remain calm, there was still a spring of anger in him, and it burst forth at this.

â€œWhere did you get it?â€ he demanded, straightening up and grabbing her by the wrist. â€œDid I not forbid you to whore?â€

She yanked her hand smartly free and took two quick steps back.

â€œYou havenâ€™t any right to forbid me to do any damned thing I want!â€ she snapped, color burning high in her cheeks. â€œAnd itâ€™s none of your business, but I didnâ€™t make this money on my back!â€

â€œWhat, then? Pimping your sister?â€

She slapped him, hard. He shouldnâ€™t have said it and knew it, but the knowledgeâ€”and his stinging cheekâ€”only made him angrier.

â€œI should bloody leave you here, youâ€”â€

â€œGood! Thatâ€™s just what I want you to do! Youâ€”youâ€”â€

Before either of them could decide upon an epithet, Rachel and Ian emerged from the wood, the tall Scot leaning heavily on her. William gave Jane a final glare and went to help, taking Murrayâ€™s weight on one side. The man stiffened, resisting for a moment, but then yielded; he had to.

â€œWhat happened?â€ William asked, nodding at the broken arrow shaft. â€œA private quarrel or just bad aim?â€

That made Murrayâ€™s mouth twitch, reluctantly.

â€œFortunes of war,â€ he said hoarsely, and sat down at the open tailboard of the wagon. He was breathing like a winded ox, but had possession of himself. He gave William a brief glance.

â€œWhat are ye doing here, a fang Sassunaich?â€

â€œNone of your business, but a good job I was,â€ William replied, just as briefly. He turned to Rachel, having made up his mind on the moment.

â€œTake the wagon and see the girls somewhere safe.â€

â€œThatâ€”â€ Rachel began, but then looked round, startled, as Jane and Fanny ran past her, crossed the road, and dived into the wood. â€œWhere are they going?â€

â€œOh, bloody hell,â€ William said, already striding across the road. â€œWait here.â€





THEY COULDNâ€™T outrun him, and they had nothing in the way of woodcraft that would enable them to lie hidden. He caught Fannyâ€”again the slower of the twoâ€”by the back of her pinafore as she was scrambling over a log. To his astonishment, she squirmed round in his grasp and launched herself at him, scratching at his face and screaming, â€œWun, Janie, wun!â€

â€œWill you bloody stop that?â€ he said crossly, holding her at armâ€™s length. â€œOw!â€ For she had sunk her teeth into his wrist, and he dropped her.

She eeled over the log and bounded away like a rabbit, still screaming her head off. He started to follow her, and then thought better. On the one hand, he had a strong impulse to abandon them, but on the other . . . He remembered Mac telling him about plovers one day as they sat near Watendlath Tarn, eating bread and cheese, watching the birds.

â€œBugger off, Mac,â€ he said under his breath, and shoved thought of both Helwater and the groom ruthlessly away. But remembered, whether he wanted to or not.

â€œThey run about and call out as though wounded, see?â€ Macâ€™s arm had been round him, keeping him from going too close to the fluttering bird. â€œBut itâ€™s to draw ye away from their nest, lest ye crush the eggs or damage the young. Look canny, though, and yeâ€™ll see them.â€

William stood quite still, calming his own breath and looking round, slow and careful, barely moving his head. And there indeed was the ploverâ€™s nest: alas for Jane, she had worn her pink calico today, and her rosy buttocks rounded smoothly up out of the grass ten feet away, quite like a pair of eggs in a nest, at that.

He walked quietly, without haste. Nobly resisting the strong urge to smack her beguilingly curved behind, he instead laid a hand flat on her back.

â€œTag,â€ he said. â€œYouâ€™re it.â€

She wriggled out from under his hand and shot up onto her feet.

â€œWhat?â€ she said. â€œWhat the bloody hell do you mean?â€ She was wild-eyed and nervy, but cross, as well.

â€œYouâ€™ve never played tag?â€ he asked, feeling foolish even as he said it.

â€œOh,â€ she said, and let out her breath a little. â€œItâ€™s a game. I see. Yes, but not for a long time.â€

He supposed one didnâ€™t play tag in a brothel.

â€œLook,â€ she said tersely, â€œwe want to go. Iâ€”I appreciate what youâ€™ve done for meâ€”for us. Butâ€”â€

â€œSit down,â€ he said, and compelled her to do so, leading her to the log over which her sister had escaped and pressing on her shoulder until she reluctantly sat. He then sat down beside her and took her hand in his. It was very small, cold and damp from the grass where sheâ€™d hidden.

â€œLook,â€ he said, firmly but notâ€”he hopedâ€”unkindly, â€œIâ€™m not letting you run off. Thatâ€™s flat. If you want to go to New York with the army, Iâ€™ll take you; Iâ€™ve already said so. If you want to return to Philadelphiaâ€”â€

â€œNo!â€ Her terror at the thought was clear now. She pulled desperately at her hand, but he wouldnâ€™t let go.

â€œIs it because of Captain Harkness? Becauseâ€”â€



She gave a cry that might have come from the throat of a wild bird caught in a trap, and he tightened his grip on her wrist. It was fine-boned and slender, but she was surprisingly strong.

â€œI know you stole the gorget backâ€ he said. â€œItâ€™s all right. No oneâ€™s going to find out. And Harkness wonâ€™t touch you again; I promise you that.â€

She made a small bubbling noise that might have been a laugh or a sob.

â€œColonel Tarletonâ€”you know, the green dragoon that made advances to you?â€”he told me that Harkness was absent without leave, hasnâ€™t come back to his regiment. Do you know anything about that?â€

â€œNo,â€ she said. â€œLet me go. Please!â€

Before he could answer this, a small, clear voice piped up from the trees a few yards away.

â€œYouâ€™d best tew him, Janie.â€

â€œFanny!â€ Jane swung round toward her sister, momentarily forgetting that she was pinioned. â€œDonâ€™t!â€

Fanny stepped out of the shadows, wary but curiously composed.

â€œIf you donâ€™t, I wiw,â€ she said, her big brown eyes fixed on Williamâ€™s face. â€œHe wonâ€™t thtop.â€ She came a little closer, cautious but not afraid. â€œIf I tew you,â€ she said, â€œdo you pwomise not to take us back?â€

â€œBack where?â€

â€œTo Phiwadelphia,â€ she said. â€œOr the army.â€

He sighed, exasperated, but short of torturing the answer out of one of the girls, clearly no progress would be made unless he agreed. And he was beginning to have a cold feeling under the ribs about just what the answer might be.

â€œI promise,â€ he said, but Fanny hung back, distrustful.

â€œSweaw,â€ she said, folding her arms.

â€œSwâ€”oh. Bloody hell. All right, thenâ€”I swear on my honor.â€

Jane made a small, dreary noise that was still a laugh. That stung.

â€œDo you think I havenâ€™t got any?â€ he demanded, turning on her.

â€œHow would I know?â€ she countered, sticking out her chin. It wobbled, but she stuck it out. â€œWhat does honor look like?â€

â€œFor your sake, youâ€™d better hope it looks a lot like me,â€ he told her, but then turned to Fanny. â€œWhat do you want me to swear on?â€

â€œYour mudderâ€™s head,â€ she said promptly.

â€œMy motherâ€™s dead.â€

â€œYour favver, den.â€

He drew a long, deep breath. Which one?

â€œI swear on my fatherâ€™s head,â€ he said evenly.

And so they told him.



â€œI KNEW HEâ€™D come back,â€ Jane said. She was sitting on the log, hands clasped between her thighs and eyes on her feet. â€œThey always do. The bad ones.â€ She spoke with a sort of dull resignation, but her lips tightened at the memory. â€œThey canâ€™t stand to think youâ€™ve got away without . . . without. I thought it would be me, though.â€



Fanny was sitting beside her sister, as close as she could get, and now she put her arms around Jane and hugged her, her face in Janeâ€™s calico shoulder.

â€œIâ€™m sowwy,â€ she whispered.

â€œI know, lovie,â€ Jane said, and patted Fannyâ€™s leg. A fierce look came into her face, though. â€œItâ€™s not your fault, and donâ€™t everâ€”everâ€”think so.â€

Williamâ€™s throat felt thick with disgust at the thought. That beautiful, flower-faced little girl, taken byâ€”

â€œHer maidenheadâ€™s worth ten pound,â€ Jane reminded him. â€œMrs. Abbott was saving her, waiting for a rich man with a taste for new-hatched chicks. Captain Harkness offered her twenty.â€ She looked directly at William for the first time. â€œI wasnâ€™t having that,â€ she said simply. â€œSo I asked Mrs. Abbott to send us up together; I said I could help keep Fanny from making a fuss. I knew what he was like, see,â€ she said, and pressed her lips involuntarily together for an instant. â€œHe wasnâ€™t the sort to plow you like a bull and have it done. Heâ€™d play with you, making you undress a bit at a time andâ€”and do thingsâ€”while he told you all about what he meant to do.â€

And so it had been easy to come behind him while he was watching Fanny, with the knife sheâ€™d taken from the kitchen hidden in the folds of her petticoats.

â€œI meant to stab him in the back,â€ she said, looking down again. â€œI saw a man stabbed that way once. But he saw on Fannyâ€™s face what Iâ€”it wasnâ€™t her fault, she couldnâ€™t help it showing,â€ she added quickly. â€œBut he turned round quick and there wasnâ€™t any choice.â€

Sheâ€™d plunged the knife into Harknessâ€™s throat and wrenched it free, intending to stab again. But that hadnâ€™t been necessary. â€œThere was blood everywhere.â€ Sheâ€™d gone pale in the telling, her hands wrapped in her apron.

â€œI frew up,â€ Fanny added matter-of-factly. â€œIt was a mess.â€

â€œI expect it was,â€ William said dryly. He was trying not to envision the sceneâ€”the candlelight, the spraying blood, the panicked girlsâ€”with remarkably little success. â€œHow did you get away?â€

Jane shrugged. â€œIt was my room, and heâ€™d bolted the door. And nobody was surprised when Fanny started screaming,â€ she added, with a trace of bitterness.

There was a basin and pitcher of water, the usual rags for mess; theyâ€™d washed themselves hastily, changed clothes, and climbed out the window.

â€œWe found a ride on a farmerâ€™s wagon, and . . . you know the rest.â€ She closed her eyes for a moment, as though reliving â€œthe rest,â€ and then opened them and looked up at him, her gaze dark as shadowed water.

â€œNow what?â€ she asked.



WILLIAM HAD BEEN asking himself that question for the last several moments of Janeâ€™s story. Having met Harkness himself, he had considerable sympathy for Janeâ€™s action, butâ€”

â€œYou planned it,â€ he said, giving her a sharp look. Her head was bent, her unbound hair hiding her face. â€œYou took the knife, you had clothes to change into, you knew how to get down from the window and get away.â€



â€œTho?â€ said Fanny, in a remarkably cold voice for a girl of her age.

â€œSo why kill him?â€ he asked, transferring his attention to Fanny, but keeping a wary eye on Jane. â€œYou were going to leave anyway. Why not just escape before he came?â€

Jane raised her head and turned it, looking him directly in the eye.

â€œI wanted to kill him,â€ she said, in a perfectly reasonable voice that chilled him despite the warmth of the day.

â€œI . . . see.â€

He saw more than the vision of Jane, with her delicate white wrists, plunging a knife into Captain Harknessâ€™s thick red throat while her little sister screamed. He saw Rachelâ€™s face, pale among the leaves, six feet away. From her expression, it was apparent that she had heard everything.

He cleared his throat.

â€œIs, um, Mr. Murray all right?â€ he asked politely. Jane and Fanny whirled, wide-eyed.

â€œHe fainted,â€ Rachel replied. She was eyeing the younger girls in much the same way that they were looking at her, with a gaze of fascinated horror. â€œHis shoulder is badly inflamed. I came to see if thee had any brandy.â€

He fumbled in his pocket and withdrew a small silver flask with the Grey family arms engraved upon it.

â€œWhisky do for you?â€ he asked, handing it over. Rachel looked surprised; whisky wasnâ€™t a popular drink, but Lord John had always had a taste for it and William had taken to it himselfâ€”though now, knowing the truth about his disgraceful taint of Scottish blood, he wasnâ€™t sure heâ€™d ever be able to drink the stuff again.

â€œIt will, I thank thee.â€ She stood holding it for a moment, clearly wanting to go to Murray but also hesitant to leave. He felt rather grateful to her for that hesitancy; he would as soon not be alone with Jane and Fannyâ€”or, rather, he didnâ€™t want to be alone with the decision as to what the devil to do about them.

Rachel appeared to correctly interpret this feeling, for with a brief â€œIâ€™ll bring it right back,â€ she disappeared in the direction of the road.

No one spoke. After that one direct look, Jane had bent her head again and sat quietly, though one hand restlessly smoothed the fabric of her skirt across one round thigh, over and over.

Fanny ran a hand over the crown of Janeâ€™s head in a protective gesture, while staring at William with a complete lack of expression. He found it unnerving.

What was he to do with them? Of course they couldnâ€™t go back to Philadelphia. And he dismissed as unworthy the impulse simply to abandon them to their own devices. Butâ€”

â€œWhy not go to New York with the army?â€ he asked, his voice seeming unnaturally loud, harsh to his own ears. â€œWhat made you run yesterday?â€

â€œOh.â€ Jane looked up slowly, her eyes a little unfocused, as though she had been dreaming. â€œI saw him again. The green dragoon. Heâ€™d wanted me to go with him the night before, and I wouldnâ€™t. But I saw him again yesterday morning and thought he was looking for me.â€ She swallowed. â€œI told youâ€”I know the ones who donâ€™t give up.â€



â€œVery perceptive of you,â€ he said, eyeing her with some respect. â€œHe doesnâ€™t. You misliked him on sight, then?â€ Because he didnâ€™t think for an instant that his having forbidden her to ply her trade would have stopped her, had she wanted to.

â€œIt wasnâ€™t that,â€ she said, and flicked Banastre Tarleton away with the sort of abrupt gesture one uses to shoo insects. â€œBut heâ€™d come to the brothel before, last year. He didnâ€™t go with me then, he chose another girlâ€”but I knew if he spent much time with me, heâ€™d likely remember why I seemed familiar to him. He said I did,â€ she added, â€œwhen he came up to me in the bread line.â€

â€œI see.â€ He paused. â€œSo you did want to go to New Yorkâ€”but not with the army. Is that right?â€

Jane shrugged, angry. â€œDoes it matter?â€

â€œWhy the devil shouldnâ€™t it matter?â€

â€œWhen has it ever mattered what a whore wants?â€ She sprang up and stamped across the clearing, leaving him staring after her in astonishment.

â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with her?â€ he demanded, turning to Fanny. The younger girl eyed him dubiously, lips pressed together, but then gave a little shrug.

â€œShe thinks you might give her to a conthable or a magith-trate,â€ she said, struggling a bit with â€œmagistrate.â€ â€œOr maybe to the army. It was a tholdier she killed.â€

William rubbed a hand over his face. In fact, the thought of delivering Jane to justice had flitted through his mind, in the wake of the shock of learning of her crime. The thought hadnâ€™t outlasted its birth, though.

â€œI wouldnâ€™t do that,â€ he said to Fanny, striving to sound reasonable. She looked at him skeptically, under level dark brows.

â€œWhy wouldnâ€™ you?â€

â€œExcellent question,â€ he said dryly. â€œAnd I havenâ€™t got an answer. But I suppose I donâ€™t need one.â€

He lifted a brow at her, and she gave a small snort of a laugh. Jane was edging along the far side of the clearing, glancing back toward Fanny every few seconds; her intent was clearâ€”but she wouldnâ€™t go without her sister. He was sure of that much.

â€œSince youâ€™re here with me,â€ he observed, â€œand not over there with your sister . . . you donâ€™t want to run, and you know she wonâ€™t go without you. Ergo, I conclude that you donâ€™t think Iâ€™d give her up to justice.â€

She shook her head, slow and solemn as an owl.

â€œJane says I donâ€™ know anyting about men yed, but I do.â€

He sighed.

â€œGod help me, Frances, you do.â€



THERE WAS NO further conversation until Rachel returned a few minutes later.

â€œI canâ€™t lift him,â€ she said directly to William, ignoring the girls for the moment. â€œWill thee help me?â€

He rose at once, relieved by the prospect of physical action, but glanced over his shoulder at Jane, still hovering by the far side of the clearing like a hummingbird.

â€œWeâ€™ll be heah,â€ Fanny said quietly. He gave her a nod, and went.

He found Murray lying by the side of the road, near the wagon. The man wasnâ€™t unconscious, but the influence of the fever upon him was clear; his gaze was bleared and his speech slurring.

â€œI câ€™n walk.â€

â€œLike hell you can,â€ William said briefly. â€œHold on to my arm.â€

He got the man sitting upright and had a look for himself at the wounded shoulder. The wound itself wasnâ€™t that bad; it was apparent no bones were broken and it hadnâ€™t bled a lot. On the other hand, the flesh was red and swollen and starting to suppurate. He leaned close and took an unobtrusive sniffâ€”not unobtrusive enough: Rachel noticed.

â€œThereâ€™s no gangrene,â€ she said. â€œI think there will notâ€”I think things will be well, so long as we can get him to a doctor soon. What does thee mean to do about thy girls?â€ she added abruptly.

He didnâ€™t bother telling her again that they werenâ€™t his. Evidently they were, at least in terms of immediate responsibilities.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ he admitted, rising to his feet. He glanced into the woods, but the clearing was far enough in that there was no flicker of garment or movement visible.

â€œThey canâ€™t go to Philadelphia, and I canâ€™t take them back to the army. The best I can think of just now is to find them some place of refuge in one of the little villages hereabouts and cache them there until I can make some provision to get them to . . . to someplace safer.â€ Wherever the hell that might be. Canada? he wondered wildly.

Rachel shook her head decidedly.

â€œThee has no notion how people talk in small placesâ€”or how quickly news and rumor spread.â€ She glanced down at Murray, who was still sitting upright but swaying, his eyes half closed.

â€œThey have no other profession,â€ she said. â€œAnd it would be quickly apparent to anyone what that profession is. They require not only refuge but refuge with people who will not cast them out once that becomes known.â€

She was brown with the sunâ€”her blue calico bonnet had fallen off in the struggle with Jane and hung back over her shouldersâ€”but her face paled when she looked at Murray. She clenched her fists, closed her eyes for an instant, then opened them, straightening to her full height, and looked William in the eye.

â€œThere is a small settlement of Friends, perhaps two hoursâ€™ travel from here. No more than three or four farms. I know of it from one of the women who came to Valley Forge with her husband. The girls could be kept safe there, for a while, at least.â€

â€œNo!â€ Murray said. â€œYe canna be . . .â€ He paused, eyes going out of focus, and braced himself on his sound arm, still swaying. He swallowed thickly. â€œNo,â€ he repeated. â€œNot . . . safe.â€

â€œIt isnâ€™t,â€ William agreed. â€œThree young women on the road, alone? And without even a pistol to defend yourselves?â€



â€œIf I had a pistol I would not use it,â€ Rachel pointed out with some asperity. â€œNor a cannon, come to that.â€

Murray laughedâ€”or at least made a noise that might pass for amusement.

â€œAye,â€ he managed, and stopped to breathe before getting the next words out. â€œYou take them,â€ he said to William. â€œIâ€™ll . . . do here, fine.â€

â€œThee bloody wonâ€™t,â€ Rachel said fiercely. She grabbed Williamâ€™s arm and pulled him closer to Murray. â€œLook at him! Tell him, since he professes not to believe me.â€

William looked, reluctantly, glancing at Murrayâ€™s face, pale as suet and slick with an unhealthy sweat. Flies clustered thick on Murrayâ€™s shoulder; he lacked the strength to brush them away.

â€œMerde,â€ William muttered under his breath. Then louder, though still with reluctance, â€œSheâ€™s right. You need a doctor, if youâ€™re to have a chance of keeping your arm.â€

That thought evidently hadnâ€™t struck Murray; death, yesâ€”amputation, no. He turned his head and frowned at the wound.

â€œBloody hell,â€ William said, and turned to Rachel.

â€œAll right,â€ he said. â€œTell me where this settlement is. Iâ€™ll take them.â€

She grimaced, fists balling up at her sides. â€œEven Friends may not take well to the sudden appearance of a stranger who asks them to give indefinite sanctuary to a murderess. I am not a stranger and can plead the girlâ€™s case better than thee can.â€ She drew a breath that swelled her bosom noticeably and looked at Murray, then turned her head to give William a piercing look.

â€œIf I do this, thee must see him safe.â€

â€œI must?â€

â€œRachel!â€ Murray said hoarsely, but she ignored him.

â€œYes. Weâ€™ll have to take the wagon, the girls and I.â€

William drew a breath of his own, but he could see that she was right. He could also see just what the decision to save Jane was costing her.

â€œAll right,â€ he said tersely. He reached up and took the gorget from his neck and handed it to her. â€œGive Jane this. She may need it, if they find themselves on their own.â€ Oddly, the removal of the gorget seemed a weight off his mind, as well. Even the possibility of being arrested if anyone in Philadelphia recognized him didnâ€™t trouble him overmuch.

He was about to remove his incriminating coat and waistcoatâ€”heâ€™d have to hide those somewhereâ€”when Rachel stepped close to him and laid a hand on his arm.

â€œThis man is my heart and my soul,â€ she said simply, looking up into his face. â€œAnd he is thy own blood, whatever thee may presently feel about the fact. I trust thee to see him safe, for all our sakes.â€

William gave her a long look, thought of several possible replies, and made none of them, but gave a curt nod.

â€œWhere should I take him?â€ he asked. â€œTo myâ€”to Lady Jâ€”I mean, to Mrs. Fâ€”I mean, God damn it,â€ he amended, feeling the blood rise in his cheeks, â€œto his aunt?â€

Rachel looked at him, startled.

â€œThee doesnâ€™t know? Of course thee doesnâ€™t, how could thee?â€ She waved off her own denseness, impatient. â€œHis aunt was shot in the course of the battle, outside Tennent Church, where she was tending the wounded.â€

Williamâ€™s annoyance was doused at once, as though ice water had been poured on his head, flooding his veins.

â€œIs she dead?â€

â€œBy the grace of our Lord, no,â€ she said, and he felt the tightness in his chest relax a little. â€œOr at least she wasnâ€™t yesterday,â€ she amended with a frown. â€œThough very badly hurt.â€ The tightness returned.

â€œShe is in the Macken house in the village of Freeholdâ€”about six miles in that direction.â€ She nodded down the road. â€œMy brother is likely there, as well, or nearby; there are still wounded from the battle there. He can deal with I-Ianâ€™s wound.â€ For the first time, her voice lost its steadiness as her eyes went to her betrothed.

Murrayâ€™s eyes were sunken and glazed with fever, but he had sufficient command of himself to reach out his good hand to her. The movement put weight on the bad arm and he grimaced, but Rachel was kneeling beside him in an instant, arms around him.

William coughed and turned discreetly away to leave them a momentâ€™s privacy in which to make their farewells. Whatever his own feelings, they deserved that. Heâ€™d seen many wounds go bad, and reckoned Murrayâ€™s chances as no better than even. On the other hand, the man was apparently both a bloody Scot and a Mohawk, and both races were notoriously hard to kill.

He had walked away from the road, and his eye now caught the flutter of pink fabric behind a bush.

â€œJane!â€ he called. â€œIs that you?â€

â€œYes,â€ she said. She stepped out into the open, folded her arms, and pointed her chin at him. â€œWhat do you mean to do? With me, I mean.â€

â€œMiss Hunter is going to take you and Fanny to a safe place,â€ he said, as gently as he could. In spite of her brave faÃ§ade, she reminded him of a fawn, dappled light coming through the trees mottling her face and gown, making her seem shy and insubstantial, as though she might fade into the forest in the next breath. â€œIâ€™ll send word to you there when Iâ€™ve made some . . . suitable arrangement.â€

â€œHer?â€ Jane shot a surprised glance toward the road. â€œWhy? Why canâ€™t you take us? Doesnâ€™t she want to stay with herâ€”the Indian?â€

â€œMiss Hunter will have time to explain everything to you on the way.â€ He hesitated, unsure what else to say to her. From the road, he heard the distant murmur of voices, Rachel and Ian Murray. He couldnâ€™t make out the words, but it didnâ€™t matter; what they were saying to each other was plain. He felt a small, sharp pain under his third waistcoat button and coughed, trying to dislodge it.

â€œThank you, thir,â€ said a soft voice behind him, and he turned to find Fanny at his elbow. She took his hand, turned it palm upward, and planted a small, warm kiss in the center.

â€œIâ€”youâ€™re most welcome, Miss Fanny,â€ he said, smiling at her in spite of everything. She nodded to him, very dignified, and walked out to the road, leaving him with Jane.

For a moment, they stood staring at each other.

â€œI offered you a lot more than a kiss,â€ she said quietly. â€œYou didnâ€™t want it. I havenâ€™t got anything else to give you in thanks.â€

â€œJane,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s notâ€”I didnâ€™tâ€”â€ And then stopped, desperately sorry but helpless to think of anything he could possibly say in reply. â€œSafe travels, Jane,â€ he said at last, his throat tight. â€œGoodbye.â€





ITâ€™S A WISE CHILD WHO KNOWS HIS FATHER

IT WAS APPARENT that, while sound, Rachelâ€™s mule wasnâ€™t up to the weight of two men the size of William and Ian Murray. No matter; they couldnâ€™t go any faster than a walk in any case; Murray could ride, and William would walk alongside to make sure the bastard didnâ€™t fall off.

Murray managed to get up into the saddle, in spite of having only one functional hand; Rachel had roughly bandaged his wounded arm and put it into a sling torn from her underpetticoat. William didnâ€™t offer him assistance, feeling reasonably sure that such an offer would be neither welcomed nor accepted.

Watching the laborious process, though, William was interested to note that while the fabric of the sling was much-laundered and faded, it had been embroidered with small blue and yellow sunbursts along one edge. Did Quaker women commonly wear attractive undergarments beneath their sober gowns?

As they set off at a cautious walk, the sound of the wagon was still audible, though fading into the rush of trees.

â€œAre ye armed?â€ Murray asked suddenly.

â€œSlightly.â€ He still had the knife Jane had pushed into his hand, now wrapped in a handkerchief and tucked in his pocket, as he had no sheath for it. He fingered the wooden handle, wondering whether it was the same knife that she . . . Well, of course it was.

â€œIâ€™m not. Will ye find me a club?â€

â€œYou donâ€™t trust me to see you safe?â€ William asked sarcastically.

Murrayâ€™s shoulders were slumped and his head thrust forward, nodding a little with the muleâ€™s gait, but he turned and gave William a look that was heavy-eyed with fever, but still surprisingly alert.



â€œOh, I trust ye fine. Itâ€™s men like the ones ye just fought I dinna trust.â€

This was a fair point; the roads were far from safe, and the knowledge gave William a severe pang of conscience on behalf of the women heâ€™d just dispatched, unarmed and unprotected, to drive miles over those very roads with a valuable mule and cart. I should have gone with them, insisted we all go together . . .

â€œMy mam always says thereâ€™s no one more stubborn than my uncle Jamie,â€ Murray observed mildly, â€œbut a Quaker lass wiâ€™ her mind made up could give Uncle Jamie a run for his money, Iâ€™ll tell ye. I couldna have stopped herâ€”and neither could you.â€

William wasnâ€™t in a mood to discuss any of the persons mentioned, nor yet engage in philosophical discussions of relative stubbornness. He put a hand on the bridle and pulled the mule to a halt.

â€œStay here. I see something that might do.â€ Heâ€™d already seen that there was little in the way of fallen branches near the road; there never was, when an armyâ€™s foragers had recently passed through. But he saw an orchard of some kind, a little way from the road, with a farmhouse beyond.

As he made his way toward the orchard, he could see that artillery had been hauled through it; there were deep furrows in the ground, and many of the trees had broken limbs, hanging like jackstraws.

There was a dead man in the orchard. American militia, by his hunting shirt and homespun breeches, lying curled among the gnarled roots of a big apple tree.

â€œShould have culled that one,â€ William said aloud, keeping his voice steady. Old apple trees never yielded much; you took them out after fifteen, twenty years and replanted. He turned away from the body, but not fast enough to avoid seeing the greedy flies rise up in a buzzing cloud from what was left of the face. He walked three paces away and threw up.

No doubt it was the cloying smell of rotting apples that rose above the ghost of black powder; the whole orchard hummed with the noise of wasps gorging themselves on the juices. He unwrapped the handkerchief from Janeâ€™s knife and thrust the knife through his belt without looking to see if there were bloodstains on it. He wiped his mouth, then, after a momentâ€™s hesitation, went and laid the handkerchief over the Rebelâ€™s face. Someone had stripped the body; he had neither weapons nor shoes.



â€œTHIS DO YOU?â€ He laid a three-foot length of applewood across the saddlebow. Heâ€™d broken it at both ends, so it made a serviceable club, about the thickness of his own forearm.

Murray seemed to wake from a doze; he drew himself slowly upright, took hold of the club, and nodded.

â€œAye, thatâ€™ll do,â€ he said softly. His voice sounded thick, and William looked at him sharply.

â€œYouâ€™d best drink some more,â€ he said, handing up the canteen again. It was getting low; probably no more than a quarter full. Murray took it, though moving sluggishly, drank, and gave it back with a sigh.



They walked without conversation for a half hour or so, leaving William time at last to sort through the events of the morning. It was well past noon now; the sun was pressing on his shoulders like a heated flatiron. How far did Rachel say it was it to Freehold? Six miles?

â€œDâ€™ye want me to tell ye, or no?â€ Murray said suddenly.

â€œTell me what?â€

There was a brief sound that might have been either amusement or pain.

â€œWhether yeâ€™re much like him.â€

Possible responses to this came so fast that they collapsed upon themselves like a house of cards. He took the one on top.

â€œWhy do you suppose I should wonder?â€ William managed, with a coldness that would have frozen most men. Of course, Murray was blazing with such a fever, it would take a Quebec blizzard to freeze him.

â€œI would, if it was me,â€ Murray said mildly.

That defused Williamâ€™s incipient explosion momentarily.

â€œPerhaps you think so,â€ he said, not trying to hide his annoyance. â€œYou may know him, but you know nothing whatever about me.â€

This time, the sound was undeniably amusement: laughter, of a hoarse, creaking sort.

â€œI helped fish ye out of a privy ten years ago,â€ Murray said. â€œThat was when I first kent it, aye?â€

Shock struck William almost dumb, but not quite.

â€œWhatâ€”that . . . that place in the mountainsâ€”Fraserâ€™s Ridge . . . ?!â€ Heâ€™d succeeded, for the most part, in forgetting the incident of the snake in the privy, and with it, most of a miserable journey through the mountains of North Carolina.

Murray took Williamâ€™s choler for confusion, though, and chose to elucidate.

â€œThe way ye came out oâ€™ the muck, your eyes bleezinâ€™ blue and your face set for murderâ€”that was Uncle Jamie to the life, when heâ€™s roused.â€ Murrayâ€™s head bobbed forward alarmingly. He caught himself and straightened up with a muffled groan.

â€œIf youâ€™re going to fall off,â€ William said, with elaborate courtesy, â€œdo it on the other side, will you?â€

â€œMmphm.â€

They paced another hundred yards before Murray came to life again, resuming the conversationâ€”if it could be called thatâ€”as though there had been no pause.

â€œSo when I found ye in the swamp, I kent who ye were. I dinna recall ye thankinâ€™ me for saving your life that time, by the way.â€

â€œYou can thank me for not strapping you into a travois with a dead panther and dragging you for miles through the dirt now,â€ William snapped.

Murray laughed, gasping a little.

â€œYeâ€™d likely do it, if ye had a dead panther.â€ The effort of laughing seemed to deprive him of balance, and he swayed alarmingly.

â€œFall off and Iâ€™ll do it anyway,â€ William said, grabbing him by the thigh to steady him. â€œDead panther or not.â€ Christ, the manâ€™s skin was so hot he could feel it through the buckskin leggings.



Despite his fog, Murray noticed his reaction.

â€œYou lived through the fever,â€ he said, and took a deep breath. â€œI will, too; dinna fash.â€

â€œIf by that expression you mean that I ought not to be concerned that youâ€™ll die,â€ William said coldly, â€œIâ€™m not.â€

â€œIâ€™m no worrit, either,â€ Murray assured him. The man wobbled slightly, reins held loose in one hand, and William wondered if he could be sunstruck. â€œYe promised Rachel, aye?â€

â€œYes,â€ William said, adding almost involuntarily, â€œI owe her and her brother my life, as much as I do you.â€

â€œMmphm,â€ Murray said agreeably, and fell silent. He seemed to be going a nasty grayish color under the sun-browned skin. This time he stayed silent for a good five minutes before coming suddenly to life again.

â€œAnd ye dinna think I ken much about ye, after listening to ye rave wiâ€™ fever for days?â€

â€œI do not,â€ William said. â€œNo more than I think Iâ€™ll know a great deal about you by the time I get you to Freehold.â€

â€œMaybe more than ye think. Stop, aye? Iâ€™m going to puke.â€

â€œWhoa!â€ The mule obligingly halted, though it clearly didnâ€™t like either the sound or the smell of what was going on behind its head, and kept sidling round in circles, trying to escape it.

William waited â€™til it was over, then handed up his canteen without comment. Murray drained it and handed it back. His hand was shaking, and William began to be worried.

â€œWeâ€™ll stop as soon as I find water,â€ he said. â€œGet you into the shade.â€ Neither of them had a hat; heâ€™d left his in the copse, rolled up with his uniform coat under a bush.

Murray didnâ€™t reply to this; he was not precisely raving, but seemed to be pursuing a separate conversation in his head.

â€œI maybe dinna ken ye that well, but Rachel does.â€

That was undeniably true and gave William an oddly mixed sense of shame, pride, and anger. Rachel and her brother did know him well; theyâ€™d saved his life and nursed him back to health, had traveled with him for weeks and shared both food and danger.

â€œShe says yeâ€™re a good man.â€

Williamâ€™s heart squeezed a little.

â€œIâ€™m obliged for her good opinion,â€ he said. The water hadnâ€™t helped that much; Murray was definitely swaying in the saddle, his eyes half closed.

â€œIf you die,â€ William said loudly, â€œIâ€™ll marry her.â€

That worked; Murrayâ€™s eyelids lifted at once. He smiled, very slightly.

â€œKen that,â€ he said. â€œKen Iâ€™m no going to die? And, besides, ye owe me a life, Englishman.â€

â€œI donâ€™t. I saved your bloody life, too; I saved the both of you from that maniacâ€”Bug, was he?â€”with the ax in Philadelphia. Weâ€™re quits.â€

Some interminable time later, Murray roused himself again.

â€œI doubt it,â€ he said.





KEEPING SCORE

JAMIE SAW THE GREYS out of the house and came back with an air of grim satisfaction. I would have laughed if it hadnâ€™t hurt to do it, but settled for smiling at him.

â€œYour son, your nephew, your wife,â€ I said. â€œFraser, three; Grey, nil.â€

He gave me a startled look, but then his face truly relaxed for the first time in days. â€œYouâ€™re feeling better, then,â€ he said, and, coming across the room, bent and kissed me. â€œTalk daft to me some more, aye?â€ He sat down heavily on the stool and sighed, but with relief.

â€œMind,â€ he said, â€œI havena the slightest idea how Iâ€™m going to keep ye, with no money, no commission, and no profession. But keep ye I will.â€

â€œNo profession, forsooth,â€ I said comfortably. â€œName one thing you canâ€™t do.â€

â€œSing.â€

â€œOh. Well, besides that.â€

He spread his hands on his knees, looking critically at the scars on his maimed right hand.

â€œI doubt I could make a living as a juggler or a pickpocket, either. Let alone a scribe.â€

â€œYou havenâ€™t got to write,â€ I said. â€œYou have a printing pressâ€”Bonnie, by name.â€

â€œWell, aye,â€ he admitted, a certain light coming into his eyes. â€œI do. But sheâ€™s in Wilmington at the moment.â€ His press had been shipped from Edinburgh in the care of Richard Bell, who wasâ€”presumablyâ€”keeping her in trust until her real owner should come to repossess her.

â€œWeâ€™ll go and get her. And thenâ€”â€ But I stopped, afraid to jinx the future by planning too far. It was an uncertain time for everyone, and no telling what the morrow might bring.

â€œBut first,â€ I amended, reaching out to squeeze his hand, â€œyou should rest. You look as though youâ€™re about to die.â€

â€œDinna talk that sort of daft,â€ he said, and laughed and yawned simultaneously, nearly breaking his jaw.

â€œLie down,â€ I said firmly. â€œSleepâ€”at least until Lieutenant Bixby shows up again with more cheese.â€ The American army had withdrawn to Englishtown, some seven miles away, only an hourâ€™s ride. The British army had decamped entirely, but as many of the militia unitsâ€™ enlistments had expired soon afterward, the roads were still very busy with men going home, mostly afoot.



He did lie down on his pallet, with surprisingly little protestâ€”a good indication of just how exhausted he really wasâ€”and was asleep in seconds.

I was very tired myself, still very weak and easily exhausted, even by something like the Greysâ€™ visit, and I lay back and dozed, stirring to wakefulness every so often when some sound roused me, but Jamie slept deeply, and it eased my heart to hear his soft, regular snore.

I woke some time later, hearing a distant knocking below. As I raised my head blearily off the pillow, I heard a voice shouting, â€œHallo, the house!â€ and snapped into instant alertness. I knew that voice.

I glanced quickly down, but Jamie was dead asleep, curled up like a hedgehog. With excruciating slowness, I managed to swing my legs off the bed andâ€”moving like a geriatric tortoise and clinging to the bed frameâ€”took the two steps that brought me to the window, where I clung to the sill.

There was a handsome bay mule in the dooryard, with a half-naked body laid over the saddle. I gaspedâ€”and immediately doubled in pain, but didnâ€™t let go the sill. I bit my lip hard, not to call out. The body was wearing buckskins, and his long brown hair sported a couple of bedraggled turkey feathers.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,â€ I breathed, through gritted teeth. â€œPlease, God, donâ€™t let him beâ€”â€ But the prayer was answered before Iâ€™d finished speaking it; the door below opened, and in the next moment William and Lieutenant Macken walked out and lifted Ian off the mule, put his arms about their shoulders, and carried him into the house.

I turned, instinctively reaching for my medical bagâ€”and nearly fell. I saved myself by a grab at the bed frame but let out an involuntary groan that brought Jamie up into a crouch, staring wildly about.

â€œItâ€™s . . . all right,â€ I said, willing my belly muscles into immobility. â€œIâ€™m fine. Itâ€™sâ€”Ian. Heâ€™s come back.â€

Jamie sprang to his feet, shook his head to clear it, and at once went to the window. I saw him stiffen and, clutching my side, followed him. William had come out of the house and was preparing to mount the mule. He was dressed in shirt and breeches, very grubby, and the sun licked his dark chestnut hair with streaks of red. Mrs. Macken said something from the door, and he turned to answer her. I donâ€™t think I made a noise, but something made him look up suddenly and he froze. I felt Jamie freeze, too, as their eyes met.

Williamâ€™s face didnâ€™t change, and after a long moment he turned to the mule again, mounted, and rode away. After another long moment, Jamie let out his breath.

â€œLet me put ye back to bed, Sassenach,â€ he said calmly. â€œIâ€™ll have to go and find Denny to put Ian right.â€





I WILL NOT HAVE THEE BE ALONE

SOMEONE HAD GIVEN HIM laudanum before setting to work on his shoulder. Strange stuff, that. Heâ€™d had it before, he thought, a long time ago, though he hadnâ€™t known the name at the time. Now Ian lay on his back, blinking slowly as the drug ebbed from his mind, trying to decide where he was and what was real. He was pretty sure most of what he was looking at right now wasnâ€™t.

Pain. That was real and something to use as an anchor. It hadnâ€™t entirely gone awayâ€”heâ€™d been aware of it, but remotely, as a disagreeable muddy green strand like a stream of dirty water meandering through his dreams. Now that he was awake, though, it was becoming more disagreeable by the minute. His eyes didnâ€™t want to focus yet, but he forced them to roll about in search of something familiar.

He found it at once.

Girl. Lass. Ifrinn, what was herâ€”â€œRachel,â€ he croaked, and she rose instantly from what she was doing and came to him, her face worried but alight.

â€œRachel?â€ he said again, uncertain, and she took hold of his good hand, pressing it to her bosom.

â€œThee is awake, I see,â€ she said softly, her eyes searching his face. â€œBut still much fevered, from the heat of thy skin. How does thee feel?â€

â€œBetter for seeinâ€™ ye, lass.â€ He tried to lick his dry lips. â€œIs there maybe water?â€

She made a small sound of distress that heâ€™d had to ask, and hurried to bring a cup to his lips. It was perhaps the best thing heâ€™d ever tasted, made better by her holding his head in her hand as he drankâ€”he was very dizzy. He didnâ€™t want to stop, but she took the cup away.

â€œMore presently,â€ she promised. â€œThee must not drink too much, too fast, or thee will vomit. And between the dirt and the blood, thee has made enough mess already,â€ she said, smiling.

â€œMmphm,â€ he said, lying back. He was mostly clean, he discovered. Someone had washed away the last of the deer fat and paint, and a good deal of sweat and blood with it. His shoulder was bound up with a poultice of some kind; it smelled tangy and familiar, but his hazy mind was a long way yet from allowing him to think of the name of the herb.

â€œDid Auntie Claire bind my arm?â€ he asked. Rachel glanced at him, her brows furrowing.



â€œThy aunt is ill,â€ she said carefully. â€œThee remembers I told thee that she was woundedâ€”shotâ€”in the battle?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, feeling blank and confused. He had no recollection of the last couple of days or of battle. â€œNo. Whatâ€”is she all right, then?â€

â€œDenny removed the ball, and thy uncle Jamie is with her. Both of them say very firmly that she will be well.â€ Her mouth twitched a bit, halfway between a smile and worry. He did his best to smile back.

â€œThen sheâ€™ll be fine,â€ he said. â€œUncle Jamieâ€™s a verra stubborn man. Can I have more water?â€

This time he drank more slowly and got more down before she took it away. There was a regular clanging noise somewhere; for a time he had taken it for some phantom of hearing left over from the dreams, but now it ceased for a moment, punctuated by a loud curse.

â€œWhatâ€”where are we?â€ he asked, beginning to be able to look at things again. His wavering sight convinced him that he was indeed in a tiny cow byre; it was new hay heâ€™d been smelling, and the warm scent of fresh cow dung. He was lying on a blanket spread over a mound of hay, but the cow was absent for the moment.

â€œA place called Freehold. The battle was fought nearby; Washington and the army have withdrawn to Englishtown, but a good many wounded soldiers have been given refuge by the inhabitants here. We currently enjoy the hospitality of the local smith, a gentleman named Heughan.â€

â€œOh.â€ The forge. That was the source of the clanging and cursing. He closed his eyes; that helped with the dizziness, but he could see shadows of his dreams on the inside of his eyelids and opened them again. Rachel was still there; that was good.

â€œWho won the battle?â€ he asked.

She shrugged, impatient. â€œSo far as anyone has said anything sensible about it, no one. The Americans are cock-a-hoop at not having been defeated, to be sureâ€”but the British army surely wasnâ€™t, either. All I care about is thee. And thee will be fine,â€ she said, and laid her hand gently on his forehead. â€œI say so. And I am as stubborn as any Scot thee cares to nameâ€”including thyself.â€

â€œI need to tell ye something, lass.â€ He hadnâ€™t meant to say that, but the words felt familiar in his mouth, as though heâ€™d said them before.

â€œSomething different?â€ She had been turning away but paused now, looking wary.

â€œDifferent? Did I tell ye things while I was . . .â€ He tried to wave a hand in illustration, but even his good arm was heavy as lead.

Rachel caught her upper lip between her teeth, regarding him.

â€œWho is Geillis?â€ she asked abruptly. â€œAnd what in the name ofâ€”of goodness did she do to thee?â€

He blinked, startled and yet relieved to hear the name. Yes, that was what heâ€™d been dreamingâ€”oh, Jesus. The relief departed at once.

â€œWhat did I say?â€ he asked warily.

â€œIf thee doesnâ€™t recall it, I donâ€™t wish to bring it back to thee.â€ She knelt down by him, skirts rustling.



â€œI remember what happenedâ€”I just want to ken what I said about it.â€

â€œWhat happened,â€ she repeated slowly, watching his face. â€œIn thy dreams, thee means? Orâ€”â€ She broke off, and he saw her throat move as she swallowed.

â€œLikely both, lass,â€ he said softly, and managed to reach for her hand. â€œI spoke of Geillis Abernathy, though?â€

â€œThee only said â€˜Geillis,â€™â€ she said, and covered his hand with both of hers, holding fast. â€œThee was afraid. And thee called out in painâ€”but of course thee was in pain, so . . . but then . . . itâ€”whatever thee saw, itâ€”â€

Color rose slowly up her neck and washed her face, and with a slight relapse into the dream, he saw her for an instant as an orchid with a dusky throat into which he could plunge hisâ€”He cut that vision off and found that he was breathing fast.

â€œIt seemed that thee experienced something other than pain,â€ she said, frowning.

â€œAye, I did,â€ he said, and swallowed. â€œCan I have a bit more water?â€

She gave it to him, but with a fixed look indicating that she didnâ€™t mean to be distracted from his story by his physical needs.

He sighed and lay back again. â€œIt was a long time agone, a nighean, and nothing to fash about now. I was takenâ€”kidnappedâ€”for a brief time, when I was maybe fourteen or so. I stayed wiâ€™ a woman named Geillis Abernathy, on Jamaica, until my uncle found me. It wasna very pleasant, but I wasna damaged, either.â€

Rachel raised an elegant brow. He loved to watch her do that, but sometimes more than others.

â€œThere were other lads there,â€ he said, â€œand they were not so lucky.â€ For a long time afterward, heâ€™d been afraid to close his eyes at night, because he saw their faces. But theyâ€™d faded away, little by littleâ€”and now he felt a spasm of guilt because heâ€™d let them go into darkness.

â€œIan,â€ Rachel said softly, and her hand stroked his cheek. He felt the rasp of his beard stubble as she touched him, and a pleasant gooseflesh ran down his jaw and shoulder. â€œThee neednâ€™t speak of it. I would not bring it back to thee.â€

â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ he said, and swallowed a little easier. â€œIâ€™ll tell yeâ€”but later. Itâ€™s an old story, and one ye dinna need to hear just now. Butâ€”â€ He stopped short and she raised the other brow.

â€œBut what I do have to tell ye, lass . . .â€ And he told her. Much of the previous two daysâ€™ events was still a blur, but he recalled vividly the two Abenaki who had hunted him. And what heâ€™d finally done, in the British camp.

She was silent for so long that he began to wonder whether heâ€™d really waked and had this conversation or was still dreaming.

â€œRachel?â€ he said, shifting uneasily on his bed of prickly hay. The door of the byre was open and there was light enough, but he couldnâ€™t read her face at all. Her gaze rested on his own face, though, hazel-eyed and distant, as though she were looking through him. He was afraid she was.

He could hear Heughan the smith outside, walking to and fro and making clanking sounds, pausing to apostrophize some uncooperative implement in coarse terms. He could hear his own heart beating, too, an uncomfortable, jerky thump.

Finally a shiver went over Rachel, as though she shook herself awake, and she put a hand on his forehead, smoothing back his hair as she looked into his eyes, her own now soft and fathomless. Her thumb came down and traced the tattooed line across his cheekbones, very slowly.

â€œI think we canâ€™t wait any longer to be married, Ian,â€ she said softly. â€œI will not have thee face such things alone. These are bad times, and we must be together.â€

He closed his eyes and all the air went out of him. When he drew breath again, it tasted of peace.

â€œWhen?â€ he whispered.

â€œAs soon as thee can walk without help,â€ she said, and kissed him, lightly as a falling leaf.





THE HOUSE ON CHESTNUT STREET

THE HOUSE WAS occupied; there was smoke drifting from the west chimney. The door was locked, though, and bolted to boot.

â€œI wonder what happened to the old door?â€ John said to Hal, trying the knob again, just in case. â€œIt used to be green.â€

â€œIf you knock on this one, you might conceivably get someone to come out and tell you,â€ Hal suggested. They werenâ€™t in uniform, but Hal was noticeably on edge, and had been since their call on General Arnold.

The general had been understandably reserved, but civil, and after reading Fraserâ€™s letter over three or four times, had agreed to give them passes to remain in the city and to make such inquiries as they saw fit.

â€œWith the understanding,â€ Arnold had said, a flash of his reputed arrogance showing through the faÃ§ade of governorship, â€œthat if I hear of anything untoward, Iâ€™ll have you both arrested and ridden out of the city on a rail.â€

â€œOn a what?â€ Hal had said incredulously, he having not encountered this peculiarly American method of making guests feel unwelcome.

â€œA rail,â€ Arnold had repeated, smiling genially. â€œLong piece of wood? Used for fences, I believe?â€



Hal had turned to John, one eyebrow raised, as though inviting him to translate the speech of some Hottentot randomly encountered. John sighed internally, but did so.

â€œAn undesirable person is mounted on the object in question,â€ he said, â€œstraddling it. Whereupon a party of men lift either end and set off through the streets with it, decanting the rider outside the city. I believe tar and feathers are sometimes applied as a preliminary gesture, though the physical effects of the rail are generally presumed to be sufficient.â€

â€œFlatten your ball sac like a horse stepped on it,â€ Arnold said, still smiling. â€œWonâ€™t do your arse any good, either.â€

â€œI should imagine not,â€ Hal said politely. His color was somewhat higher than usual, but he gave no other indication of offense, which Grey thought a reasonable indicationâ€”not that he needed oneâ€”of the importance of their mission to Hal.

The sound of the bolt grating free interrupted his recollection. The door swung open, revealing his housekeeper and cook, Mrs. Figg, fowling piece in hand.

â€œLord John!â€ she exclaimed, dropping the gun with a clatter.

â€œWell, yes,â€ he said, stepping in and picking it up. He smiled, feeling affection well up in his bosom at sight of herâ€”substantial, tidy, and beribboned as always. â€œItâ€™s very good to see you again, Mrs. Figg. Allow me to make you acquainted with my brother, theâ€”â€

â€œWeâ€™ve met,â€ Hal said, a wry edge to his voice. â€œHow do you do, madam?â€

â€œBetter than Your Grace, by the looks of you,â€ Mrs. Figg replied, narrowing her eyes at him. â€œStill breathing, though, I see.â€ She sounded as though this was not entirely a desirable state of affairs, but Hal smiled broadly at her.

â€œDid you manage to bury the silver in time?â€ he asked.

â€œCertainly,â€ she replied with dignity, and, turning to John, asked, â€œYou come to get it, my lord? I can have it dug up right smart.â€

â€œPerhaps not just yet,â€ John said. He looked round, noting the missing banister railing on the upper landing, the smudged and pockmarked wall by the staircase, andâ€”â€œWhatâ€™s happened to the chandelier?â€

Mrs. Figg sighed and shook her head darkly.

â€œThatâ€™d be Master William,â€ she said. â€œHow is he, my lord?â€

â€œIâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t know, Mrs. Figg. I was in some hopes that he might have been hereâ€”but I gather not?â€

She looked disturbed at this.

â€œNo, sir. Weâ€™ve not seen him sinceâ€”well, since the day you went away yourself.â€ She looked hard at him, taking in everything from the cropped hair to the fading bruises and the undistinguished suit, shook her head and sighed, but then straightened her broad shoulders, determined to be cheerful. â€œAnd glad we are to see you, sir! And Your Grace,â€ she added as a definite afterthought. â€œGo sit yourselves down and Iâ€™ll have you up a nice cup of tea in two minutes.â€

â€œYou have tea?â€ Hal said, brightening.

â€œWe buried the tea chest first thing,â€ she informed him. â€œBut I just brought in a brick for Miss Dottie, soâ€”â€



â€œDottieâ€™s here?â€

â€œTo be sure,â€ said Mrs. Figg, pleased to be the bearer of good news. â€œIâ€™ll just step out to the kitchen and fetch her.â€

This proved to be unnecessary, as the sound of the back door opening betokened Dottieâ€™s entrance, carrying an apronful of lumpy objects. These proved to be vegetable marrows from the kitchen garden, which cascaded over the floor in a bouncing flood of green and yellow as she let go the apron in order to leap at her father and embrace him.

â€œPapa!â€

For an instant, Halâ€™s face changed entirely, soft with love, and Grey was surprised and disconcerted to feel tears come to his own eyes. He turned away, blinking, and wandered over to the sideboard, meaning to give them a private moment.

The silver tea service was gone, of course, but his Meissen porcelain plates were in their accustomed spots on the plate rail. He touched the cool gilt-ribboned border of one, feeling oddly disembodied. And his place shall know him no more.

But Dottie was talking now to both of them; Grey turned round to her, smiling.

â€œIâ€™m so glad youâ€™re both safe and both here!â€ Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes sparklingâ€”and Greyâ€™s heart misgave him at the knowledge that this state of happiness would be quenched within the next minute, as soon as Hal told her the reason for their presence. Before any such doom could fall, though, Dottie had seized the reins of the conversation and driven it off in another direction entirely.

â€œSince you are hereâ€”Uncle John, could we possibly use your house? For the wedding, I mean. Please, please?â€

â€œThe wedding?â€ Hal disengaged himself gently and cleared his throat. â€œYour wedding?â€

â€œOf course I mean my wedding, Papa. Donâ€™t be silly.â€ She beamed at her uncle, placing a coquettish hand on his sleeve. â€œMay we, Uncle John? We cannot be married in a meetinghouse, but we must have witnesses for a proper marriage of Friends, and, really, Iâ€™m sure Papa wouldnâ€™t want to see me married in the public room of a tavern. Would you?â€ she appealed, turning to Hal, whose expression had reverted to its earlier guardedness.

â€œWell, certainly you may, my dear,â€ John said, glancing round his parlor. â€œAssuming that I retain possession of this place long enough for the marriage to take place. When is the ceremony to be, and how many witnesses will we need to accommodate?â€

She hesitated, tapping a fingernail against her teeth.

â€œIâ€™m not really sure. There will be some of the conscientious Friends who, like Denny, have been put out of meeting for joining the Continental army. And some friendsâ€”friends in the lowercase, meaning no disrespectâ€”if any are left in Philadelphia. And . . . family?â€ She hesitated again, looking at her father sideways, from under her lashes. John suppressed a smile.

Hal closed his eyes and sighed deeply.

â€œYes, Iâ€™ll come to your wedding,â€ he said, opening them with resignation. â€œAnd so will Henry, if I have to drag him by the scruff of the neck. I suppose Mrs. Woodcock must be invited, too,â€ he added, with a marked lack of enthusiasm. â€œBut of course Adam . . . andâ€”and Benâ€”â€

John thought for a moment that he must tell her now, but his brotherâ€™s lips closed, firmed with determination. He didnâ€™t look at John, but John caught the â€œNot now, for Godâ€™s sake. Let her be happy for a bit longer,â€ as clearly as if it had been spoken aloud.

â€œNo, thatâ€™s too bad,â€ Dottie said with regret, and met her fatherâ€™s eyes directly. â€œIâ€™m sorry about Mama. I did write to her, though.â€

â€œDid you, sweetheart?â€ Hal said, sounding almost normal. â€œThat was thoughtful.â€ He tilted his head at her, though, eyes narrowing a bit. â€œWhat else?â€

â€œOh.â€ Her color, which had returned to normal, rose again, and she began absently pleating her apron with one hand. â€œWell. Did you know that Rachelâ€”Denzellâ€™s sisterâ€”is affianced to Ian Murray? Thatâ€™s Mr. Jamesâ€”no, no, we donâ€™t use â€˜Mister,â€™ sorryâ€”heâ€™s the nephew of James Fraser. You knowâ€”â€

â€œI do know,â€ Hal said, in a tone cutting off further amendation. â€œWho he is, I mean. What are you saying, Dottie? Without embroidery, if you please.â€

She sniffed at him but didnâ€™t appear to be discomposed in the least.

â€œWell, then. Rachel and Ian wish to be married as soon as they can, and so do Denny and I. As all the witnesses will be present, why not have both marriages at the same time?â€

This time, Hal did look at John. Who returned the look, somewhat taken aback.

â€œAh . . . well. I suppose that would mean additional guests? Including the aforementioned Mr. Fraser? Iâ€™m sure you will excuse my using his title, my dear; Iâ€™m accustomed to such social excesses.â€

â€œWell, yes. Rachel says that Mrs. Fraser is enough recovered that they will return to Philadelphia tomorrow or next day. And then of course thereâ€™s Fergus and his wife, Marsali, and perhaps the children, and I donâ€™t know if there are other friends whoâ€”I donâ€™t think Ian has any Mohawk relations nearby, butâ€”â€

â€œOne, two, three, four, five . . .â€ John turned and began counting the small gilt chairs that stood rigidly to attention beneath the wainscoting. â€œI think we shall be somewhat cramped, Dottie, but ifâ€”â€

Mrs. Figg cleared her throat. The sound was sufficiently impressive that everyone else stopped talking and looked at her.

â€œBeg pardon, gentlemen,â€ she said, and a faint flush was visible on her round face. â€œI donâ€™t mean to be forward or presuming . . . but so happens that I mentioned to the Reverend Figg about Miss Dottie and Friend Denzell needing a place to be married in.â€

She cleared her throat, the blush growing deeper beneath her dark skin, so that she bore a surprising resemblance to a just-fired cannonball, Grey thought, charmed by the notion.

â€œAnd . . . well, the long and the short of it, maâ€™am and gentlemen, is that the reverend and his congregation would be pleased was you to consider being married in the new church building, you having been so kind as to contribute to it. â€™Tainâ€™t anyways fancy, mind, butâ€”â€



â€œMrs. Figg, you are a marvel.â€ Grey clasped her hands in his, an attention that flustered her to the point of speechlessness. Seeing this, he let go, though this allowed Dottie to swoop in and kiss the housekeeper, exclaiming in gratitude. That was all right, but when Hal took Mrs. Figg by the hand and kissed it, the poor lady was reduced nearly to the point of suffocation and, snatching back her hand, retreated in haste, muttering disjointedly about tea and narrowly avoiding tripping on a marrow.

â€œIs it all right to be married in a church?â€ Hal asked Dottie, once Mrs. Figg had retired to a safe distance. â€œItâ€™s not like Jews, is it? We neednâ€™t be circumcised in order to attend? Because if so, I think your guest list may be substantially reduced.â€

â€œOh, Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s not . . .â€ Dottie began rather vaguely, but her attention was distracted by something seen through the front window. â€œGoodness, is that . . . ?â€

Not bothering to complete her thought, she flew to the unbolted door and yanked it open, revealing a startled William on the stoop.

â€œDottie!â€ he said. â€œWhatâ€”â€ And then caught sight of John and Hal. Williamâ€™s face underwent a lightning shift that made a frisson run straight down Johnâ€™s back to his tailbone. Heâ€™d seen that exact expression on Jamie Fraserâ€™s face a hundred times, at leastâ€”but had never before seen it on Williamâ€™s.

It was the look of a man who doesnâ€™t like his immediate prospects one bitâ€”but who feels himself entirely capable of dealing with them. William stepped inside, repelling by force of will Dottieâ€™s abortive attempt to embrace him. He removed his hat and bowed to Dottie, then, punctiliously, to John and Hal.

â€œYour servant, maâ€™am. Sirs.â€

Hal snorted, looking his nephew over from head to toe. William was dressed much as John and Hal were, in ordinary clothesâ€”though clothes of good cut and quality, John observed; clearly his own.

â€œAnd where the devil have you been for the last three days, may I ask?â€

â€œNo, you maynâ€™t,â€ William replied briefly. â€œWhy are you here?â€

â€œLooking for you, for one thing,â€ John replied equably, before Hal could stick his oar in again. Heâ€™d put the fowling piece on the mantel, easily within Halâ€™s reach, but was reasonably sure it wasnâ€™t loaded. â€œAnd for Captain Richardson, for another. Have you seen him recently?â€

Williamâ€™s expression of surprise made John heave an internal sigh of relief. â€œNo, I havenâ€™t.â€ William glanced shrewdly from one man to the other. â€œIs that what you were doing at Arnoldâ€™s headquarters? Looking for Richardson?â€

â€œYes,â€ John answered, surprised. â€œHow did youâ€”oh. You were watching the place.â€ He smiled. â€œI did wonder how you happened to appear here so fortuitously. You followed us from General Arnoldâ€™s.â€

William nodded and, stretching out a long arm, drew out one of the chairs from the wall. â€œI did. Sit down. Things need to be said.â€

â€œThat sounds rather ominous,â€ Dottie murmured. â€œPerhaps Iâ€™d best fetch the brandy.â€

â€œPlease do, Dottie,â€ John said. â€œTell Mrs. Figg we want the â€™57, if you would. If it isnâ€™t buried, I mean.â€



â€œI think everything of an alcoholic nature is in the well, actually. Iâ€™ll fetch it.â€

Mrs. Figg herself arrived at this point with a rattling tea tray, apologizing for the lowly earthenware pot in which the beverage was brewing, and within a few moments, everyone was provided with a steaming cup and a small glass of the â€™57.

â€œThank you, sweetheart,â€ Hal said, accepting a glass from Dottie, then adding pointedly, â€œYou neednâ€™t stay.â€

â€œIâ€™d rather you did, Dottie,â€ William said quietly, but with an overt stare at Hal. â€œThere are things you ought to know, I think.â€

With no more than a brief glance at her father, Dottie, who had been picking up the scattered squash, sat down on the ottoman, opposite her cousin.

â€œTell me, then,â€ she said simply.

â€œNothing out of the way,â€ he assured her, with an assumption of casualness. â€œIâ€™ve recently discovered that I am the natural son of one James Fraser, whoâ€”â€

â€œOh,â€ she said, and looked at him with renewed interest. â€œI did think General Fraser reminded me of someone! Of course, thatâ€™s it! Goodness, Willie, you do look like him!â€

William looked flabbergasted, but quickly pulled himself together.

â€œHeâ€™s a general?â€ he asked Hal.

â€œHe was,â€ Hal said. â€œHeâ€™s resigned his commission.â€

William made a small, humorless noise. â€œHas he? Well, so have I.â€

After a long silent moment, John placed his cup carefully on its saucer with a small clink.

â€œWhy?â€ he asked mildly, at the same moment that Hal, frowning, said, â€œCan you do such a thing while technically a prisoner of war?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ William said tersely, and evidently in answer to both questions. â€œBut Iâ€™ve done it. Now, as to Captain Richardson . . .â€ and he recounted his astonishing encounter with Denys Randall-Isaacs on the road.

â€œOr, rather, Denys Randall, as he now calls himself. Evidently his stepfatherâ€™s a Jew, and he wishes to avoid the association.â€

â€œSensible,â€ Hal said briefly. â€œI donâ€™t know him. What else do you know about him, William? Whatâ€™s his connection with Richardson?â€

â€œI havenâ€™t the faintest idea,â€ William said, and, draining his cup, reached for the pot and poured another. â€œThere is one, obviously, and prior to this, I would have assumed that Randall perhaps worked with, or for, Richardson.â€

â€œPerhaps he still does,â€ John suggested, a slight edge in his voice. Heâ€™d been a spy himself for some years and was disinclined to take things said by known intelligencers at face value.

That seemed to take William aback for a moment, but he nodded reluctantly.

â€œAll right,â€ he conceded. â€œBut tell meâ€”why the devil are you two interested in Richardson?â€

They told him.

At the conclusion, Hal was perched anxiously on the ottoman beside Dottie, an arm round her shaking shoulders. She was weeping silently, and he was dabbing at her face with his handkerchief, this now a grubby rag following its service as a flag of truce.

â€œI donâ€™t believe it,â€ he was repeating doggedly, for the sixth or seventh time. â€œDo you hear me, darling, I do not believe it, and I wonâ€™t have you believe it, either.â€

â€œN-no,â€ she said obediently. â€œNo . . . I wonâ€™t. Oh, Ben!â€

In some hopes of distracting her, John turned back to William.

â€œAnd what business brought you to Philadelphia, may I ask? You canâ€™t have come in search of Captain Richardson, because when you left camp, you didnâ€™t know heâ€™d disappeared.â€

â€œI came on a personal matter,â€ William said, in a tone suggesting that the matter was still personal and was going to remain that way. â€œBut also . . .â€ He pressed his lips together for a moment, and again John had that odd sense of dislocation, seeing Jamie Fraser. â€œI was going to leave this here for you, in case you came back to the city. Or ask Mrs. Figg to send it to New York, if . . .â€ His voice trailed away, as he pulled a letter from the breast of his dark-blue coat.

â€œBut I neednâ€™t now,â€ he concluded firmly, and put it away again. â€œItâ€™s only saying what Iâ€™ve already told you.â€ A slight flush touched his cheekbones, though, and he avoided Johnâ€™s eye, turning instead to Hal.

â€œIâ€™ll go and find out about Ben,â€ he said simply. â€œIâ€™m not a soldier any longer; thereâ€™s no danger of my being taken up as a spy. And I can travel much more easily than you can.â€

â€œOh, William!â€ Dottie took the handkerchief from her father and blew her nose with a small, ladylike honk. She looked at him with brimming eyes. â€œWill you, really? Oh, thank you!â€

That was not, of course, the end of it. But it was no revelation to Grey that William possessed a stubbornness so obviously derived from his natural father that no one but Hal would even have thought of arguing with him. And even Hal didnâ€™t argue long.

In due course, William rose to go.

â€œGive Mrs. Figg my love, please,â€ he said to John, and, with a small bow to Dottie, â€œGoodbye, cousin.â€

John followed him to the door to let him out, but at the threshold put a hand on his sleeve.

â€œWillie,â€ he said softly. â€œGive me the letter.â€

For the first time, William looked a little less than certain. He put his hand to his breast, but left it there, hesitant.

â€œI wonâ€™t read itâ€”unless you donâ€™t come back. But if you donâ€™t . . . I want it. To keep.â€

William drew breath, nodded, and, reaching into his coat, removed a sealed cover and handed it over. Grey saw that it had been sealed with a thick daub of candle wax and that William hadnâ€™t used his signet, preferring instead to stamp it with his thumbprint, firm in the hot wax.

â€œThank you,â€ he said through the lump in his throat. â€œGodspeed. Son.â€





THE SENSE OF THE MEETING

THE METHODIST CHURCH was a modest wooden building with plain glass windows, and, while it did have an altar, might otherwise easily have passed as a Quaker meetinghouse, bar three framed cross-stitched samplers bearing Bible verses that hung on one wall. I heard Rachel let out her breath as she stopped just inside, looking around.

â€œNo flowers?â€ Mrs. Figg had said the day before, scandalized. â€œI understand plain, but God made flowers!â€

â€œA Friendsâ€™ meetinghouse would not have flowers,â€ Rachel had said, smiling. â€œWe think them somewhat pagan, and a distraction to worship. But we are thy guests, and surely a guest must not tell his host how to keep his own house.â€

Mrs. Figg blinked at the word â€œpagan,â€ but then made a low humming noise and settled back into benignity.

â€œWell and good, then,â€ she said. â€œHis lordship has three good rosebushes, and thereâ€™s sunflowers in every yard in town. Lot of honeysuckle, too,â€ she added thoughtfully. There was; everyone planted honeysuckle by the privy.

As a nod to the Quakersâ€™ sensibilities, though, there was only one vase of flowersâ€”a very plain glass vaseâ€”between the two wooden benches that had been set at the front of the room, and the faint perfume of honeysuckle and pink cabbage roses mingled with the turpentine smell of hot pine boards and the pungent scents of fairly clean but very hot people.

Rachel and I stepped outside again, joining the rest of what I supposed might be called the wedding party, in the shade under a big lime tree. People were still arriving in ones and twos, and I caught a good many curious looks directed at usâ€”though these were not aimed at the two brides.

â€œYou are being married in . . . that?â€ Hal said, eyeing Dottieâ€™s Sunday-best gown of soft gray muslin with a white fichu and a bow at the back of the waist. Dottie raised one smooth blond brow at him.

â€œHa,â€ she said. â€œMummy told me what she wore when you married her in a tavern in Amsterdam. And what your first wedding was like. Diamonds and white lace and St. Jamesâ€™s Church didnâ€™t help all that much, did they?â€

â€œDorothea,â€ Denzell said mildly. â€œDonâ€™t savage thy father. He has enough to bear.â€

Hal, who had flushed at Dottieâ€™s remarks, went somewhat redder at Dennyâ€™s and breathed in a menacing rasp, but didnâ€™t say anything further. Hal and John were both wearing full dress uniform and far outshone the two brides in splendor. I thought it rather a pity that Hal wouldnâ€™t get to walk Dottie down the aisle, but he had merely inhaled deeply when the form of the marriage was outlined to him and saidâ€”after being elbowed sharply in the ribs by his brotherâ€”that he was honored to witness the event.

Jamie, by contrast, did not wear uniform, but his appearance in full Highland dress made Mrs. Figgâ€™s eyes bulgeâ€”and not only hers.

â€œSweet Shepherd of Judea,â€ she muttered to me. â€œIs that man wearing a woolen petticoat? And what sort of pattern is that cloth? Enough to burn the eyes out your head.â€

â€œThey call it a FÃ¨ileadh beag,â€ I told her. â€œIn the native language. In English, itâ€™s usually called a kilt. And the pattern is his family tartan.â€

She eyed him for a long moment, the color rising slowly in her cheeks. She turned to me with her mouth open to ask a question, then thought better and shut it firmly.

â€œNo,â€ I said, laughing. â€œHe isnâ€™t.â€

She snorted. â€œEither way, heâ€™s like to die of the heat,â€ she predicted, â€œand so are those two gamecocks.â€ She nodded at John and Hal, glorious and sweating in crimson and gold lace. Henry had also come in uniform, wearing his more modest lieutenantâ€™s apparel. He squired Mercy Woodcock on his arm and gave his father a stare daring him to say anything.

â€œPoor Hal,â€ I murmured to Jamie. â€œHis children are rather a trial to him.â€

â€œAye, whose arenâ€™t?â€ he replied. â€œAll right, Sassenach? Ye look pale. Had ye not best go in and sit down?â€

â€œNo, Iâ€™m quite all right,â€ I assured him. â€œI just am pale, after a month indoors. Itâ€™s good to be in the fresh air.â€ I had a stick, as well as Jamie, to lean on but was feeling quite well, bar a slight stitch in my side, and was enjoying the sensations of mobility, if not the sensation of wearing stays and petticoats in hot weather again. It was going to be even hotter, sitting packed together once the meeting began; the Reverend Mr. Figgâ€™s congregation was there, of course, it being their church, and the benches were filled with bodies.

The church had no bell, but a few blocks away the bell of St. Peterâ€™s began to toll the hour. It was time, and Jamie, I, and the Grey brothers made our way inside and found our places. The air hummed with murmured conversation and curiosityâ€”the more so at the British uniforms and Jamieâ€™s plaid, though both he and the Greys had left their swords at home, in deference to the Friendsâ€™ meeting.

Both curiosity and conversation rose to a much higher pitch when Ian walked in. He wore a new shirt, white calico printed with blue and purple tulips, his buckskins and breechclout, moccasinsâ€”and an armlet made of blue and white wampum shells, which I was reasonably sure that his Mohawk wife, Works With Her Hands, had made for him.

â€œAnd here, of course, is the best man,â€ I heard John whisper to Hal. Rollo stalked in at Ianâ€™s heel, disregarding the further stir he caused. Ian sat down quietly on one of the two benches that had been set at the front of the church, facing the congregation, and Rollo sat at his feet, scratched himself idly, then collapsed and lay panting gently, surveying the crowd with a yellow stare of lazy estimation, as though judging them for eventual edibility.

Denzell came in, looking a little pale, but walked up and sat down on the bench beside Ian. He smiled at the congregation, most of whom murmured and smiled back. Denny wore his best suitâ€”he owned twoâ€”a decent navy broadcloth with pewter buttons, and while he was both shorter and less ornamental than Ian, did not by any means disappear beside his outlandish brother-in-law-to-be.

â€œYouâ€™re no going to be sick, lass?â€ Jamie said to Rachel. She and Dottie had come in, but hovered near the wall. Rachelâ€™s hands were clenched in the fabric of her skirt. She was white as a sheet, but her eyes glowed. They were fastened on Ian, who was looking at no one but her, his own heart in his eyes.

â€œNo,â€ she whispered. â€œCome with me, Dottie.â€ She held out a hand, and the two girls walked together to the other bench and sat down. Dottieâ€™s color was high, and so was her head. Rachel folded her hands in her lap and resumed looking at Ian. I felt Jamie sigh a little and relax. On Jamieâ€™s far side, Jenny craned to see round him, then smiled with gratification.

Sheâ€™d made Rachelâ€™s dress herself, for after the exigencies of recent months, Rachel owned nothing that wasnâ€™t near rags. And while Jenny was generally in favor of modesty in dress, she knew her way around a bustline. The dress was a pale-green chintz with a small pattern of dark-green curling vines, and fitted like a glove. With her dark-brown hair shining loose on her shoulders and hazel eyes huge in her face, Rachel looked like some denizen of the forestâ€”perhaps a tree nymph.

I was about to share this fancy with Jamie when the Reverend Mr. Figg walked up to the front of the church, turned, and smiled at the congregation.

â€œBlessings to you all this day, brothers and sisters!â€ he said, and was answered by a genial rumble of â€œBlessings to you, brother!â€ and discreet â€œAmens.â€

â€œWell, now.â€ He glanced from Ian and Denny to the girls, then back to the congregation. â€œWeâ€™re gathered here for a wedding today. But the ladies and gentlemen being married belong to the Society of Friends, so it will be a Quaker weddingâ€”and thatâ€™s maybe a little different from ones youâ€™ve seen before, so I take the liberty of telling you how it goes.â€

A little hum of interest and speculation, which he quieted with one hand. Mr. Figg was small and dapper in black suit and high white stock, but had immense presence, and every ear was tuned attentively to his explanations.

â€œWe have the honor to host this meetingâ€”for thatâ€™s what the Friends call their worship. And for them, a wedding is just a normal part of meeting. Thereâ€™s no priest or minister involved; the lady and the gentleman just . . . marry each other, when they feel like itâ€™s the right time.â€

That caused a ripple of surprise, perhaps a little disapproval, and I could see the color rise in Dottieâ€™s cheeks. Mr. Figg turned to smile at the girls, then back to his congregation.

â€œI think perhaps one of our Quaker friends might tell us a little bit about their notion of meeting, as Iâ€™m sure they know more about it than I do.â€ He turned expectantly toward Denzell Hunterâ€”but it was Rachel who rose to her feet. Mr. Figg didnâ€™t see her and started with surprise when she spoke behind him, making everyone laugh.

â€œGood morning,â€ she said, soft-spoken but clear, when the laughter had died down. â€œI thank you all for your presence here. For Christ said, â€˜Wherever two or more of you are gathered in my name, there am I.â€™ And that is all the essence of a meeting of Friends: that Christ may make His presence known among usâ€”and within us.â€ She spread her hands a little. â€œSo we gather, and we listenâ€”both to one another and to the light within us. When a person is moved of the spirit to speak, he or she does speak.â€

â€œOr sing, if thee likes,â€ Dottie put in, dimpling at John.

â€œOr sing,â€ Rachel agreed, smiling. â€œBut we do not fear silence, for often God speaks loudest in the quiet of our hearts.â€ And with that, she sat down again, composed.

A moment of shuffling and blinking among the crowd was succeeded in fact by an expectant silenceâ€”this broken by Denny, who rose deliberately and said, â€œI am moved to tell you how grateful I am for your gracious use of us. For I was put out of meeting, and my sister with me, for my stated intent to join the Continental army. And for the same reason, we are not welcome as members of Philadelphia meeting.â€ He glanced at Rachel, light glinting from his spectacles.

â€œThis is a grievous thing to a Friend,â€ he said quietly. â€œFor our meeting is where our lives and souls abide, and when Friends marry, the whole of their meeting must approve and witness the marriage, for the community itself will support the marriage. I have deprived my sister of this approval and support, and I beg she will forgive me.â€

Rachel gave an unladylike snort. â€œThee followed thy conscience, and if I hadnâ€™t thought thee right, I would have said so.â€

â€œIt was my responsibility to take care of thee!â€

â€œThee has taken care of me!â€ Rachel said. â€œDo I look malnourished? Am I naked?â€

A ripple of amusement ran through the congregation, but neither of the Hunters was noticing.

â€œI took thee from thy home and from the meeting that cared for thee and obliged thee to follow me into violence, into an army full of violent men.â€

â€œThat would be me, I expect,â€ Ian interrupted, clearing his throat. He looked at Mr. Figg, who seemed somewhat stunned, then at the rapt assemblage on the benches. â€œIâ€™m no a Friend myself, ye ken. Iâ€™m a Highlander and a Mohawk, and they dinna come much more violent than that. By rights, I shouldna wed Rachel, and her brother shouldna let me.â€

â€œI should like to see him stop me!â€ said Rachel, sitting bolt upright with her fists curled on her knees. â€œOr thee, either, Ian Murray!â€

Dottie appeared to be finding the conversation amusing; I could see her struggling not to laughâ€”and, glancing sideways along the bench in front of me, I could see precisely the same expression on her fatherâ€™s face.

â€œWell, itâ€™s on my account that ye couldna be wed in a proper Quaker meeting,â€ Ian protested.

â€œNo more than on mine,â€ Denny said, grimacing.

â€œMea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa,â€ Jamie murmured in my ear. â€œDâ€™ye think I should say itâ€™s all my fault, for leaving Ian wiâ€™ the Indians and beinâ€™ a bad example to him?â€

â€œOnly if the spirit moves you,â€ I said, not taking my eyes off the show. â€œPersonally, Iâ€™d advise you and the spirit to stay out of it.â€



Mrs. Figg was not disposed to stay out of it. She cleared her throat loudly.

â€œNow, pardon me for interrupting, but from what I understand, you Friends think a womanâ€™s equal to a man, is that right?â€

â€œIt is,â€ Rachel and Dottie said firmly together, and everyone laughed.

Mrs. Figg flushed like a ripe black plum, but kept her composure. â€œWell, then,â€ she said. â€œIf these ladies want to marry with you gentlemen, why do you think you got any business trying to talk them out of it? Have you maybe got your own reservations about the matter?â€

A distinctly feminine murmur of approval came from the congregation, and Denny, who was still standing, seemed to be struggling for his own composure.

â€œDoes he have a cock?â€ came a French-accented whisper from behind me and an unhinged giggle from Marsali in response. â€œYou canâ€™t get married without a cock.â€

This reminiscence of Fergus and Marsaliâ€™s unorthodox wedding on a Caribbean beach made me stuff my lace handkerchief into my mouth. Jamie shook with suppressed laughter.

â€œI do have reservations,â€ Denzell said, taking a deep breath. â€œThough not,â€ he added hastily, with a glance at Dottie, â€œregarding my desire to wed Dorothea or the honor of my intentions toward her. My reservationsâ€”and perhaps Friend Ianâ€™s, though I must not speak for himâ€”lie entirely the other way. That is, Iâ€”we, perhapsâ€”feel that we must lay bare our failings and limitations as . . . as husbandsâ€”â€ And for the first time, he, too, blushed. â€œThat Dorothea and Rachel may . . . may come to a properâ€”er . . .â€

â€œThat they know what they may be getting into?â€ Mrs. Figg finished for him. â€œWell, thatâ€™s a fine sentiment, Dr. Hunterâ€”â€

â€œFriend,â€ he murmured.

â€œFriend Hunter,â€ she said, with a minimal roll of the eyes. â€œBut I tell you two things. One, your young lady probably knows more about you than you do.â€ More laughter. â€œAnd twoâ€”speaking as a woman with some experienceâ€”I can tell you that nobody knows what being marriedâ€™s going to be like until you find yourself in the midst of it.â€ She sat down with an air of finality, to a hum of approbation.

There was a certain amount of glancing to and fro and a sense of movement on the left side of the church, where several men sat together. I had seen them come in, with women who were plainly their wives; the women had separated, though, and gone to sit on the right side of the church, which made me think that they might be Quakers, though there was nothing in their dress that differentiated them from the other workmen and merchants in the congregation. I could see them come to some sort of silent consensus now, and one of them rose.

â€œI am William Sprockett,â€ he said formally, and cleared his throat. â€œWe have come to speak in support of Friend Hunter. For we also are Friends who have followed the dictates of our conscience to involvement with rebellion and other matters that a Friend would normally seek to avoid. And in consequence . . . have been read out of meeting.â€

He paused, brow furrowed, evidently not sure how to go on. A small woman in yellow rose on the other side and spoke clearly.



â€œWhat my husband seeks to say, friends, is that a man who would not do as his inner light tells him to is no man. And that while a man of conscience can be mighty inconvenient at times, it donâ€™t make him a bad husband.â€ She smiled at Mr. Sprockett and sat down.

â€œYes,â€ said Mr. Sprockett gratefully. â€œAs my wife is kind enough to say, going to fight donâ€™t unfit us for marriage. So weâ€™ve all comeâ€â€”he swept a broad hand around him, indicating his companions and the wives across the aisleâ€”â€œto approve and witness thy marriage, Friend Hunter.â€

â€œAnd we will support thy marriage, Dorothea,â€ Mrs. Sprockett put in, with a bob of her head. â€œAnd thine, Rachel.â€

Denny Hunter had remained standing while all this colloquy was going on.

â€œI . . . thank you, Friends,â€ he said, and sat down abruptly, followed more slowly by the Sprocketts.

A hush fell upon the room, and for a little while there was no sound but the remote noise of the streets outside. Here and there a cough, the clearing of a throat, but, overall, silence. Jamie laid a hand on mine, and my fingers turned to intertwine with his. I could feel his pulse in my own fingertips, the solid bones of knuckle and phalanges. His right hand, battered and marked with the scars of sacrifice and labor. Marked also with the signs of my love, the crude repairs done in pain and desperation.

Blood of my blood, bone of my bone . . .

I wondered whether people who are unhappily married think of their own nuptials when they witness a wedding; I thought that those who are happy always do. Jennyâ€™s head was bowed, her face calm and inward but peaceful; did she think now of Ian and her wedding day? She did; her head turned a little to one side, she laid a hand lightly on the bench and smiled at the ghost who sat by her side.

Hal and John sat on the bench in front of us, a little to the side, so I could catch glimpses of their faces, so much alike and yet so different. Both of them had been married twice.

It was a slight shock, in fact, to recall that Johnâ€™s second marriage had been to me, for he felt entirely separate from me now, our brief partnership seeming so removed in time as almost to be unreal. And then . . . there was Frank.

Frank. John. Jamie. Sincerity of intention wasnâ€™t always enough, I thought, looking at the young people on the benches at the front of the church, none of them now looking at one another but staring at their folded hands, the floor, or sitting with closed eyes. Perhaps realizing that, as Mrs. Figg had said, a marriage is made not in ritual or in words but in the living of it.

A movement pulled me out of my thoughts; Denny had risen to his feet and held out a hand to Dottie, who rose as though mesmerized and, reaching out, clasped both his hands in hers, hanging on for dear life.

â€œDoes thee feel the sense of the meeting clear, Dorothea?â€ he asked softly, and at her nod, spoke:

â€œIn the presence of the Lord, and before these our Friends, I take thee, Dorothea, to be my wife, promising, with divine assistance, to be unto thee a loving and faithful husband so long as we both shall live.â€

Her voice was low but clearly audible as, face shining, she replied:



â€œIn the presence of the Lord, and before these our Friends, I take thee, Denzell, to be my husband, promising, with divine assistance, to be unto thee a loving and faithful wife so long as we both shall live.â€

I heard Hal catch his breath, in what sounded like a sob, and then the church burst into applause. Denny looked startled at this but then broke into a brilliant smile and led Dottie, beaming on his arm, out through the congregation to the back of the church, where they sat close together on the last bench.

People murmured and sighed, smiling, and the church gradually quietedâ€”but not to its former sense of contemplation. There was now a vibrant sense of expectation, tinged perhaps with a little anxiety, as attention focused on Ian and Rachelâ€”no longer looking at each other but down at the floor.

Ian took a breath audible to the back benches, raised his head, and, taking the knife from his belt, laid it on the bench beside him.

â€œAye, well . . . Rachel kens I was once married, to a woman of the Wolf clan of the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka. And the Mohawk way of marriage is maybe none so different from the way Friends do it. We sat beside each other before the people, and our parentsâ€”theyâ€™d adopted me, kenâ€”spoke for us, sayinâ€™ what they kent of us and that we were of good character. So far as they knew,â€ he added apologetically, and there was a breath of laughter.

â€œThe lass I was to wed had a basket on her lap, filled wiâ€™ fruit and vegetables and other bits oâ€™ food, and she said to me that she promised to feed me from her fields and care for me. And Iâ€”â€ He swallowed and, reaching out, laid a hand on his knife. â€œI had a knife, and a bow, and the skins of some otters Iâ€™d taken. And I promised to hunt for her and keep her warm wiâ€™ my furs. And the people all agreed that we should be married, and so . . . we were.â€

He stopped, biting his lip, then cleared his throat and went on.

â€œBut the Mohawk dinna take each other for as long as they liveâ€”but only for as long as the woman wishes. My wife chose to part wiâ€™ meâ€”not because I hurt or mistreated her, but for . . . for other reasons.â€ He cleared his throat again, and his hand went to the wampum armlet round his biceps.

â€œMy wife was called Wakyoâ€™teyehsnonhsa, which means â€˜Works With Her Hands,â€™ and she made this for me, as a love token.â€ Long brown fingers fumbled with the strings, and the strip of woven shells came loose, slithering into his hand. â€œNow I lay it down, as witness that I come here a free man, that my life and my heart are once more mine to give. And I hope I may be allowed now to give them forever.â€

The blue and white shells made a soft clicking noise as he laid them on the bench. He let his fingers rest on them for a moment, then took his hand away.

I could hear Halâ€™s breathing, steady now but with a faint rasp. And Jamieâ€™s, thick in his throat.

I could feel all sorts of things moving like wraiths in the thick, still air of the church. Sentiment, sympathy, doubt, apprehension . . . Rollo growled very softly in his throat and fell silent, yellow-eyed and watchful at his masterâ€™s feet.

We waited. Jamieâ€™s hand twitched in mine, and I looked up at him. He was looking at Ian, intent, his lips pressed tight, and I knew he was wondering whether to stand up and speak on Ianâ€™s behalf, to assure the congregationâ€”and Rachelâ€”of Ianâ€™s character and virtue. He caught my glance, though, shook his head very slightly, and nodded toward the front. It was Rachelâ€™s part to speak, if she would.

Rachel sat still as stone, face bleached as bone and her eyes on Ian, burning. But she said nothing.

Neither did she move, but something moved in her; I could see the knowledge of it cross her face, and somehow her body changed, straightening and settling. She was listening.

We all listened with her. And the silence kindled slowly into light.

There was a faint throb in the air then, not quite a sound, and people began to look up, called from the silence. A blur appeared between the benches at the front, and a hummingbird materialized, drawn through the open window, a tiny blur of green and scarlet hovering beside the coral trumpets of the native honeysuckle.

A sigh came from the heart of the church, and the sense of the meeting was made clear.

Ian rose, and Rachel came to meet him.





A CODA IN THREE-TWO TIME

DENZELL AND DOROTHEA

IT WAS THE BEST party that Dorothea Jacqueline Benedicta Grey had ever attended. She had danced with earls and viscounts in the most beautiful ballrooms in London, eaten everything from gilded peacock to trout stuffed with shrimp and riding on an artful sea of aspic with a Triton carved of ice brandishing his spear over all. And sheâ€™d done these things in gowns so splendid that men blinked when she hove into view.

Her new husband didnâ€™t blink. He stared at her so intently through his steel-rimmed spectacles that she thought she could feel his gaze on her skin, from across the room and right through her dove-gray dress, and she thought she might burst with happiness, exploding in bits all over the taproom of the White Camel tavern. Not that anyone would notice if she did; there were so many people crammed into the room, drinking, talking, drinking, singing, and drinking, that a spare gallbladder or kidney underfoot would pass without notice.

Just possibly, she thought, one or two whole people might pass without notice, tooâ€”right out of this lovely party.

She reached Denzell with some difficulty, there being a great many well-wishers between them, but as she approached him, he stretched out a hand and seized hers, and an instant later they were outside in the night air, laughing like loons and kissing each other in the shadows of the Anabaptist Meeting House that stood next door to the tavern.

â€œWill thee come home now, Dorothea?â€ Denny said, pausing for a momentary breath. â€œIs thee . . . ready?â€

She didnâ€™t let go of him but moved closer, dislodging his glasses and enjoying the scent of his shaving soap and the starch in his linenâ€”and the scent of him underneath.

â€œAre we truly married now?â€ she whispered. â€œI am thy wife?â€

â€œWe are. Thee is,â€ he said, his voice slightly husky. â€œAnd I am thy husband.â€

She thought heâ€™d meant to speak solemnly, but such an uncontainable smile of joy spread across his face at the speaking that she laughed out loud.

â€œWe didnâ€™t say â€˜one fleshâ€™ in our vows,â€ she said, stepping back but keeping hold of his hand. â€œBut does thee think that principle obtains? Generally speaking?â€

He settled his glasses more firmly on his nose and looked at her with intense concentration and shining eyes. And, with one finger of his free hand, touched her breast.

â€œIâ€™m counting on it, Dorothea.â€



SHEâ€™D BEEN IN his rooms before. But first as a guest, and then as an assistant, coming up to pack a basket with bandages and ointments before accompanying him to some professional call. It was quite different now.

Heâ€™d opened all the windows earlier and left them so, careless of flying insects and the butcherâ€™s shop down the street. The second floor of the building would have been suffocating after the dayâ€™s heatâ€”but with the gentle night breeze coming through, the air was like warm milk, soft and liquid on the skin, and the meaty smells of the butcherâ€™s shop were now overborne by the night perfume of the gardens at Bingham House, two streets over.

All trace of his profession had been cleared away, and the light of the candle he lit shone serenely on a plainly furnished but comfortable room. Two small wing chairs sat beside the hearth, a single book on the table between them. And, through the open door, a bed fresh-made with a smooth counterpane and plump white pillows beckoned enticingly.

The blood still thrummed through her body like wine, though sheâ€™d had very little to drink. Still, she felt unaccountably shy and stood for a moment just inside the door, as though waiting to be invited in. Denny lit two more candles and, turning, saw her standing there.



â€œCome,â€ he said softly, stretching out a hand to her, and she did. They kissed lingeringly, hands roaming slowly, clothes beginning to loosen. Her hand drifted casually down and touched him through his breeches. He drew breath and would have said something, but wasnâ€™t quick enough.

â€œOne flesh,â€ she reminded him, smiling, and cupped her hand. â€œI want to see thy half of it.â€



â€œTHEE HAS SEEN such things before,â€ Denny said. â€œI know thee has. Thee has brothers, for one thing. Andâ€”and in the course of . . . of treating wounded men . . .â€ He was lying naked on the bed, and so was she, fondling the object in question, which seemed to be enjoying the attention immensely. His fingers were sliding through her hair, playing with her earlobes.

â€œI hope thee doesnâ€™t think I ever did this to any of my brothers,â€ she said, sniffing him with pleasure. â€œAnd those of wounded men arenâ€™t generally in a condition to be appreciated at all.â€

Denny cleared his throat and stretched himself a little, not quite squirming.

â€œI think thee should allow me to appreciate thy own flesh for a bit,â€ he said. â€œIf thee expects me to be able to make thee a wife tonight.â€

â€œOh.â€ She looked down at his cock and then at herself, surprised. â€œWhat doâ€”does theeâ€”mean? Why wouldnâ€™t thee be able to?â€

â€œAh.â€ He looked pleased and eagerâ€”he was so young without his glassesâ€”and bounced off the bed, going into the outer room, his bottom pale and tidy in the candlelight. To Dottieâ€™s astonishment, he came back with the book sheâ€™d noticed on the table and handed it to her. It was bristling with bookmarks, and as she took it, it fell open in her hands, displaying several drawings of a naked man in cross section, his private parts in various stages of operation.

She looked up at Denny in disbelief.

â€œI thoughtâ€”I know thee is a virgin; I didnâ€™t want thee to be frightened, or unprepared.â€ He was blushing like a rose, and instead of collapsing in howls of laughter, which she badly wanted to do, she shut the book gently and took his face between her hands.

â€œIs thee a virgin, too, Denny?â€ she said softly. His blush grew fierce, but he kept her gaze.

â€œYes. Butâ€”I do know how. Iâ€™m a physician.â€

That was too much, and she did laugh, but in small, half-stifled blurts of giggling, which infected him, and in seconds they were in each otherâ€™s arms on the bed, shaking silently, with occasional snorts and repetitions of â€œIâ€™m a physician,â€ which sent them into fresh paroxysms.

At last she found herself on her back, breathing heavily, Denny lying on top of her, and a slick of perspiration oiling them. She lifted a hand and touched his chest, and gooseflesh rippled over him, the dark hairs of his body curly and bristling. She was trembling, but not with either fear or laughter.

â€œIs thee ready?â€ he whispered.

â€œOne flesh,â€ she whispered back. And they were.





THE CANDLES had burned down nearly to their sockets, and the naked shadows on the wall moved slowly.

â€œDorothea!â€

â€œThee should probably be quiet,â€ she advised him, briefly removing her mouth in order to talk. â€œIâ€™ve never done this before. Thee wouldnâ€™t want to distract me, now, would thee?â€ Before he could summon a single word, she had resumed her alarming actions. He groanedâ€”he couldnâ€™t help itâ€”and laid his hands gently, helplessly, on her head.

â€œItâ€™s called fellatio, did thee know that?â€ she inquired, pausing momentarily for breath.

â€œI did. How . . . I mean . . . Oh. Oh, God.â€

â€œWhat did you say?â€ Her face was beautiful, so flushed that the color showed even by candlelight, her lips deep rose and wet . . .

â€œI saidâ€”oh, God.â€

A smile lit her shadowed face with happiness, and her already firm grip on him tightened. His shadow jerked.

â€œOh, good,â€ she said, and with a small, triumphant crow of laughter, bent to slay him with her sharp white teeth.

IAN AND RACHEL

IAN LIFTED THE GREEN gown off in a whuff of fabric, and Rachel shook her head hard, shedding hairpins in all directions with little pinging sounds. She smiled at him, her dark hair coming damply down in chunks, and he laughed and plucked out a few more of the little wire hoops.

â€œI thought I should die,â€ she said, running her fingers through her loosened hair, which Jenny had put up before the party at the White Camel tavern. â€œBetween the pins sticking into my head and the tightness of my stays. Unlace me, will theeâ€”husband?â€ She turned her back to him but looked over her shoulder, eyes dancing.

He hadnâ€™t thought it possible to be more moved in his feelings or more excited in bodyâ€”but that one word did both. He wrapped one arm around her middle, making her squeak, pulled the knot of her laces loose, and gently bit the back of her neck, making her squeak much louder. She struggled, and he laughed, holding her tighter as he loosened the laces. She was slim as a willow sapling and twice as springy; she squirmed against him, and the small struggle heated his blood still further. If he had had no self-control, he would have had her pinned to the bed in seconds, stays and shift and stockings be damned.

But he did and let her go, easing the stay straps off her shoulders and the stays themselves over her head. She shook herself again, smoothing down the damp shift over her body, then stood tall, preening for him. Her nipples stood out hard against the limp fabric.

â€œI won thy wager for thee,â€ she said, passing a hand over the delicate blue satin ribbon threaded through the neck of her shift and fluttering the hem, adorned with embroidered flowers in blue and yellow and rose.

â€œHow did ye hear about that?â€ He reached for her, pulled her close, and clasped both hands on her arse, bare under the shift. â€œChrist, yeâ€™ve got a sweet round wee bum.â€

â€œBlasphemy, on our wedding night?â€ But she was pleased, he could tell.

â€œItâ€™s not blasphemy, itâ€™s a prayer of thanksgiving. And who told ye about the wager?â€ Fergus had bet him a bottle of stout that a Quaker bride would have plain linen undergarments. He hadnâ€™t known, himself, but had had hopes that Rachel wouldnâ€™t feel that pleasing her husband was the same thing as making a vain show for the world.

â€œGermain, of course.â€ She put her own arms around him and clasped him in similar manner, smiling up. â€œThine is neither wee nor round, but no less sweet, I think. Does thee need help with thy fastenings?â€

He could tell she wanted to, so he let her kneel and unbutton the flies of his breeches. The sight of the top of her dark, disheveled head, bowed earnestly to the task, made him put his hand gently on it, feeling her warmth, wanting the touch of her skin.

His breeches fell and she stood up to kiss him, her hand caressing his standing cock as though by afterthought.

â€œThy skin is so soft there,â€ she said against his mouth. â€œLike velvet!â€

Her touch wasnâ€™t tentative but very light, and he reached down and wrapped his fingers round hers, showing her the way of it, how to grasp it firmly and work it a bit.

â€œI like it when thee moans, Ian,â€ she whispered, pressing closer and working it more than a bit.

â€œIâ€™m not moaning.â€

â€œYes, thee is.â€

â€œIâ€™m only breathinâ€™ a bit. Here . . . I like that . . . but . . . here.â€ Swallowing, he picked her upâ€”she made a little whoopâ€”and carried her the two steps to the bed. He dropped her onto the mattressâ€”she made a louder whoopâ€”and landed beside her, scooping her into his arms. There was a certain amount of writhing, giggling, and inarticulate noises, and she got him out of his calico shirt, while he had her shift pulled up at the bottom and down at the top but still puddled round her waist.

â€œI win,â€ she said, wiggling the wadded shift down over her hips and kicking it off.

â€œYe think that, do ye?â€ He bent his head and took her nipple in his mouth. She made a very gratifying noise and clutched his head. He butted her gently under the chin, then lowered his head and sucked harder, flicking his tongue like an adderâ€™s.

â€œI like it when ye moan, Rachel,â€ he said, pausing for breath and grinning down at her. â€œDâ€™ye want me to make ye scream?â€

â€œYes,â€ she said, breathless, one hand on her wet nipple. â€œPlease.â€

â€œIn a bit.â€ Heâ€™d paused to breathe, lifting himself above her to let a bit of air in between themâ€”it was a small room, and hotâ€”and she reached up to feel his chest. She rubbed a thumb lightly over his nipple, and the sensation shot straight down to his cock.

â€œLet me,â€ she said softly, and lifted herself, a hand round his neck, and suckled him, very gently.

â€œMore,â€ he said hoarsely, bracing himself against her weight. â€œHarder. Teeth.â€

â€œTeeth?â€ she blurted, letting go.

â€œTeeth,â€ he said breathlessly, rolling onto his back and pulling her on top. She drew breath and lowered her head, hair spilling across his chest.

â€œOw!â€

â€œThee said teeth.â€ She sat up anxiously. â€œOh, Ian, Iâ€™m sorry. I didnâ€™t mean to hurt thee.â€

â€œIâ€”ye didnâ€™t . . . well, ye did, but . . . I meanâ€”do it again, aye?â€

She looked at him, dubious, and it occurred to him that when Uncle Jamie told him to go slow and gentle with his virgin, it might not have been all to do with sparing the virgin.

â€œHere, mo nighean donn,â€ he said, drawing her down beside him. His heart was hammering and he was sweating. He brushed the hair back from her temple and nuzzled her ear. â€œSlow for a bit, aye? Then Iâ€™ll show ye what I mean by teeth.â€



IAN SMELLED OF wine and whisky and musky male skinâ€”he burned astonishingly under her hands and smelled now something like a distant skunk, but in a much better way. She pressed her face into the curve of his shoulder, breathing him in with pleasure. She had his cock in her hand, gripping firmly . . . but curiosity made her loose her hold and grope lower, fingers probing through the thickness of his pubic hair. He breathed out very suddenly when she cupped his scrotum, and she smiled against his shoulder.

â€œDoes thee mind, Ian?â€ she whispered, rolling the lovely egg-like shapes of his balls in her palm. Sheâ€™d seen male scrota many times, baggy and wrinkled, and while she wasnâ€™t disgusted, had never thought them more than mildly interesting. This was wonderful, drawn up tight, the skin so soft and so hot. Daring, she scooted down a little and felt farther back between his legs.

He had an arm about her shoulders and it tightened, but he didnâ€™t tell her to stop, instead spreading his legs a little, allowing her to explore him. Sheâ€™d wiped menâ€™s arses hundreds of time, and the fleeting thought occurred to her that not all of them took great care . . . but his hair was curly and very clean, and her hips moved against him involuntarily as her fingertip slid tentatively between his buttocks. He twitched, tensing involuntarily, and she stopped, feeling him shiver. Then she realized that he was laughing, shaking silently.

â€œAm I tickling thee?â€ she asked, raising up on one elbow. The light of the single candle flickered over his face, hollowing his cheeks and making his eyes shine as he smiled up at her.



â€œAye, thatâ€™s one word for it.â€ He ran a hand half roughly up her back and gripped her by the nape. He shook his head slowly, looking at her. His hair had come loose from its binding and spread out dark behind his head. â€œHere I am, tryinâ€™ to go slow, tryinâ€™ to be gentle . . . and next thing I ken, yeâ€™re squeezinâ€™ my balls and stickinâ€™ your fingers up my arse!â€

â€œIs that wrong?â€ she asked, feeling a slight qualm. â€œI didnâ€™t mean to be . . . er, too . . . bold?â€

He pulled her down and hugged her close.

â€œYe canna be too bold wiâ€™ me, lass,â€ he whispered in her ear, and ran his own hand down her backâ€”and down farther. She gasped.

â€œShh,â€ he whispered, and went onâ€”slowly. â€œI thoughtâ€”yeâ€™d maybe be scairt at first. But yeâ€™re no scairt a bit, are ye?â€

â€œI am. Iâ€™m t-terrified.â€ She felt the laughter bubble up through her chest, but there was some truth in it, tooâ€”and he heard that. His hand stopped moving and he drew back enough to look at her, squinting a little.

â€œAye?â€

â€œWell . . . not terrified, exactly. Butâ€”â€ She swallowed, suddenly embarrassed. â€œI justâ€”this is so nice. But I know when youâ€”when weâ€”well, it does hurt, the first time. Iâ€”Iâ€™m somewhat afraid that . . . well, I donâ€™t want to stop what weâ€™re doing, but I . . . Iâ€™d like to get that part over with, so I neednâ€™t worry about it.â€

â€œOver with,â€ he repeated. His mouth twitched a bit, but his hand was gentle on the small of her back. â€œWell, then.â€ He eased his other hand down and cupped her, very delicately, between the legs.

She was swollen there, and slipperyâ€”had been growing more so ever since heâ€™d lifted her gown off over her head. His fingers moved, one and then two, playing, stroking . . . and . . . and . . .

It took her entirely by surprise, a feeling she knew but bigger, bigger, and then she gave way to it entirely, washed through with ecstasy.

She settled slowly into limpness, throbbing. Everywhere. Ian kissed her lightly.

â€œWell, that didna take verra long, did it?â€ he murmured. â€œPut your hands on my arms, mo chridhe, and hold on.â€ He moved over her, agile as a big cat, and eased his cock between her legs, sliding slow but firm. Very firm. She flinched, clenching involuntarily, but the way was slick and her flesh swollen in welcome and no amount of resistance would keep him out.

She realized that her fingers were digging into his arms, but didnâ€™t let go.

â€œAm I hurting ye?â€ he said softly. Heâ€™d stopped moving, his full length inside her, stretching her in a most unnerving way. Something had torn, she thought; it burned a little.

â€œYes,â€ she said, breathless. â€œI donâ€™t . . . mind.â€

He lowered himself very slowly and kissed her face, her nose, her eyelids, lightly. And all the time the awareness of itâ€”himâ€”inside her. He pulled back a little and moved. She made a small, breathless noise, not quite protest, a little pain, not quite encouragement . . .

But he took it as that and moved more strongly.

â€œDinna be worrit, lass,â€ he said, a little breathless, too. â€œI wonâ€™t take long, either. Not this time.â€





ROLLO WAS snoring in the corner, lying on his back for coolness, legs folded like a bugâ€™s.

She tasted faintly sweet, of her own musk and a trace of blandness with an animal tang that he recognized as his own seed.

He buried his face in her, breathing deep, and the slight salt taste of blood made him think of trout, fresh-caught and barely cooked, the flesh hot and tender, pink and slick in his mouth. She jerked in surprise and arched up into him, and he tightened his hold on her, making a low hmmm of reassurance.

It was like fishing, he thought dreamily, hands under her hips. Feeling with your mind for the sleek dark shape just under the surface, letting the fly come down just so . . . She drew her breath in, hard. And then engagement, the sudden sense of startlement, and then a fierce awareness as the line sprang taut, you and the fish so focused on each other that there was nothing else in the world . . .

â€œOh, God,â€ he whispered, and ceased to think, only feeling the small movements of her body, her hands on his head, the smell and taste of her, and her feelings washed through him with her murmured words.

â€œI love thee, Ian. . . .â€

And there was nothing else in the world but her.

JAMIE AND CLAIRE

THE LIGHT OF a low yellow half-moon shone through gaps in the trees, glimmering on the dark rushing waters of the Delaware. So late at night, the air was cool by the river, very welcome to faces and bodies heated by dancing, feasting, drinking, and generally being in close proximity to a hundred or so other hot bodies for the last six or seven hours.

The bridal couples had escaped fairly early: Denzell and Dottie very inconspicuously, Ian and Rachel to the raucous shouts and indelicate suggestions of a roomful of festive wedding guests. Once theyâ€™d left, the party had settled down to serious merrymaking, the drinking now unhampered by the interruption of wedding toasts.

Weâ€™d taken our leave of the Grey brothersâ€”Hal, as father of one of the brides, was hosting the partyâ€”sometime after midnight. Hal had been sitting in a chair near a window, very drunk and wheezing slightly from the smoke, but sufficiently composed as to stand and bow over my hand.

â€œYou want to go home,â€ I advised him, hearing the faint squeak of his breathing over the winding-down noises of the party. â€œAsk John if heâ€™s got any more ganja, and if he does, smoke it. It will do you good.â€ And not only in a physical way, I thought.

â€œI thank you for your kind advice, madam,â€ he said dryly, and, too late, I recalled our conversation the last time he had been exposed to ganja: his worry over his son Benjamin. If he thought of it, too, though, he said nothing, and merely kissed my hand and nodded to Jamie in farewell.

John had stood by his brotherâ€™s side most of the evening and stood behind him now as we took our leave. His eyes met mine briefly, and he smiled but didnâ€™t step forward to take my handâ€”not with Jamie at my shoulder. I wondered now briefly if I should ever see either of the Greys again.

We hadnâ€™t gone back to the printshop but had wandered down by the river, enjoying the coolness of the night air and chatting about the young couples and the excitements of the day.

â€œI imagine their nights are beinâ€™ a bit more exciting still,â€ Jamie remarked. â€œReckon the lassies will be sore come morning, poor wee things.â€

â€œOh, it may not be just the girls,â€ I said, and he sniffed with amusement.

â€œAye, well, ye may be right about that. I seem to recall wakinâ€™ the next morning after our wedding and wondering for a moment whether Iâ€™d been in a fight. Then I saw you in the bed wiâ€™ me and knew I had.â€

â€œDidnâ€™t slow you down any,â€ I remarked, dodging a pale stone in my path. â€œI seem to recall being rather rudely awakened next morning.â€

â€œRude? I was verra gentle with ye. More than ye were with me,â€ he added, a distinct grin in his voice. â€œI told Ian so.â€

â€œYou told Ian what?â€

â€œWell, he wanted advice, and so Iâ€”â€

â€œAdvice? Ian?â€ To my certain knowledge, the boy had begun his sexual career at the age of fourteen, with a prostitute of similar age in an Edinburgh brothel, and hadnâ€™t looked back. Besides his Mohawk wife, there were at least half a dozen other liaisons that I knew of, and I was sure I didnâ€™t know them all.

â€œAye. He wanted to know how to deal kindly wiâ€™ Rachel, her beinâ€™ virgin. Something new to him,â€ he added wryly.

I laughed.

â€œWell, theyâ€™ll be having an interesting night of it, thenâ€”all of them.â€ I told him about Dottieâ€™s request in camp, Rachelâ€™s advent, and our ad hoc session of premarital counseling.

â€œYe told them what?â€ He snorted with amusement. â€œYe make me say, â€˜Oh, God,â€™ all the time, Sassenach, and itâ€™s mostly not to do wiâ€™ bed at all.â€

â€œI canâ€™t help it if youâ€™re naturally disposed to that expression,â€ I said. â€œYou do say it in bed with no little frequency. You even said it on our wedding night. Repeatedly. I remember.â€

â€œWell, little wonder, Sassenach, wiâ€™ all the things ye did to me on our wedding night.â€

â€œWhat I did to you?â€ I said, indignant. â€œWhat on earth did I do to you?â€

â€œYe bit me,â€ he said instantly.

â€œOh, I did not! Where?â€

â€œHere and there,â€ he said evasively, and I elbowed him. â€œOh, all rightâ€”ye bit me on the lip when I kissed ye.â€

â€œI donâ€™t recall doing that at all,â€ I said, eyeing him. His features were invisible, but the moonglow off the water as he walked cast his bold, straightnosed profile in silhouette. â€œI remember you kissing me for quite a long time while you were trying to unbutton my gown, but Iâ€™m sure I didnâ€™t bite you then.â€

â€œNo,â€ he said thoughtfully, and ran a hand lightly down my back. â€œIt was later. After I went out to fetch ye some food, and Rupert and Murtagh and the rest all chaffed me. I know, because it was when I drank some oâ€™ the wine Iâ€™d fetched back, I noticed it burned the cut in my lip. And I bedded ye again before I got round to the wine, so it must haâ€™ been that time.â€

â€œHa,â€ I said. â€œBy that time, you wouldnâ€™t have noticed if Iâ€™d bitten your head off like a praying mantis. Youâ€™d got it properly up your nose and thought you knew everything.â€

He put an arm round my shoulders, pulled me close, and whispered in my ear, â€œIâ€™d got it properly up you, a nighean. And ye werenâ€™t noticing all that much yourself, besides what was goinâ€™ on between your legs.â€

â€œRather hard to ignore that sort of carry-on,â€ I said primly.

He gave the breath of a laugh and, stopping under a tree, gathered me in and kissed me. He had a lovely soft mouth.

â€œWell, I willna deny ye taught me my business, Sassenach,â€ he murmured. â€œAnd ye made a good job of it.â€

â€œYou caught on reasonably quickly,â€ I said. â€œNatural talent, I suppose.â€

â€œIf it was a matter of special training, Sassenach, the human race would haâ€™ died out long since.â€ He kissed me again, taking more time over it.

â€œDâ€™ye think Denny kens what heâ€™s about?â€ he asked, letting go. â€œHeâ€™s a virtuous wee man, aye?â€

â€œOh, Iâ€™m sure he knows everything he needs to,â€ I protested. â€œHeâ€™s a physician, after all.â€

Jamie gave a cynical laugh.

â€œAye. While he may see the odd whore now and then, itâ€™s likely in the way of his profession, not hers. Besides . . .â€ He moved close and, putting his hands through the pocket slits in my skirt, took a firm and interesting grip on my bottom. â€œDo they teach ye in medical college how to spread your wifeâ€™s wee hams and lick her from tailbone to navel?â€

â€œI didnâ€™t teach you that one!â€

â€œIndeed ye didnâ€™t. And youâ€™re a physician, no?â€

â€œThatâ€”Iâ€™m sure that doesnâ€™t make any sense. Are you drunk, Jamie?â€ â€œDinna ken,â€ he said, laughing. â€œBut Iâ€™m sure you are, Sassenach. Letâ€™s go home,â€ he whispered, leaning close and drawing his tongue up the side of my neck. â€œI want ye to make me say, â€˜Oh, God,â€™ for ye.â€

â€œThat . . . could be arranged.â€ Iâ€™d cooled down during our walk, but the last five minutes had lit me like a candle, and if Iâ€™d wanted to go home and take off my stays before, I was now wondering whether I could wait that long.

â€œGood,â€ he said, pulling his hands out of my skirt. â€œAnd then Iâ€™ll see what I can make you say, mo nighean donn.â€

â€œSee if you can make me say, â€˜Donâ€™t stop.â€™â€





PART SIX



The Ties That Bind





THE BODY ELECTRIC

Redondo Beach, CA

December 5, 1980

IF SHE HADNâ€™T NEEDED stamps, she wouldnâ€™t have stopped in at the post office. Sheâ€™d have clipped this batch of letters to the mailbox for the postman to collect, or posted them in the corner mailbox when she took the kids down to the beach to look for pelicans.

But she did need stamps; there were at least a dozen more niggling things to deal with: things needing notarization or photocopies or tax returns or . . .

â€œS-word,â€ she muttered, sliding out of the car. â€œBloody F-wording S-word!â€ This was small relief to her feelings of anxiety and oppression. It really wasnâ€™t fair. Who needed the relief of occasional bad language more than a mother of small children?

Maybe she should start using her motherâ€™s â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ!â€ instead. Jem had incorporated that one into his own collection of expletives before he turned four and had long since taught it to Mandy; they wouldnâ€™t be warped by hearing it.

It hadnâ€™t been this hard, last time. Well, no, she corrected herself. It had been a lot harder, in the most important respect. But this . . . this . . . this quagmire of pettifogging detailsâ€”property, bank accounts, leases, notifications . . . She flicked the sheaf of sealed envelopes in her hand against her thigh with irritation. Some days, she would have taken Jem and Mandy by their hands and run, not walked, straight into the stones with no feeling save relief at abandoning all this bloody Stuff.

She hadnâ€™t really had much Stuff when she did it the first time. And, of course, sheâ€™d had someone to leave it with. Her heart squeezed a little, remembering the day sheâ€™d nailed down the lid on the wooden shipping crate that held her familyâ€™s modest history: the silver passed down through her fatherâ€™s family, cabinet photographs of her motherâ€™s parents, the collection of her fatherâ€™s first editions, her motherâ€™s World War II Queen Alexandra uniform cap, still with a faint but detectible odor of iodine about it. And taken such pains in writing the note to Roger to go with it: You told me once that . . . everyone needs a history. This is mine. . . .

Almost sure then that sheâ€™d never see Roger again, let alone the silverware.

She blinked hard and shoved the door of the post office open with so much force that it crashed into the wall, and everyone in the lobby turned to stare at her. Hot-faced, she grabbed the doorframe and closed it with exaggerated care, then crossed the lobby soft-footed, avoiding all eyes.

She shoved the envelopes through the collection-box slot one by one, with a certain feeling of grim satisfaction at each tedious thing disposed of. Preparing to disappear into the past, leaving all Stuff behind, was one thing; preparing to disappear while thinking that you might eventually come back and need that Stuff againâ€”or that your children might come back twenty years later, without you . . . She swallowed. That was something else again, as her father was inclined to say. She couldnâ€™t just dump it all on Uncle Joe; he didnâ€™tâ€”

She turned, glancing across the lobby automatically at her PO box, and stopped, seeing the letter. She felt the hairs rising on her forearm as she strode across the grubby linoleum and reached for the knob, even before her mind had consciously registered the fact that it didnâ€™t look like a utility bill, a credit-card application, or any other sort of official mail.

G-H-I-D-E-I . . . the tumblers of the combination lock fell and the heavy little door swung open. And right there in the post office, she smelled heather and peat smoke and the breath of the mountains, so strongly that her eyes blurred and her own breath caught in her throat.

It was a regular white envelope, addressed to her in Joe Abernathyâ€™s round, capable hand. She could feel something inside it, another envelope, this one with a lump on itâ€”a seal of some kind? She made it to her rented car before ripping it open.

It wasnâ€™t an envelope but a sheet of paper, folded and sealed with wax, blurs of black ink bleeding through the paper where a quill had scratched too deep. An eighteenth-century letter. She pressed it to her face, inhaling, but the scent of smoke and heather was goneâ€”if it had ever been there. It smelled now only of age and brittle paper; not even the tang of the iron-gall ink was left.

There was a brief note from Uncle Joe, a slip of paper folded next to the letter.

Bree, darlinâ€™â€”



Hope this catches you in time. It came from the estate agent in Scotland. He said when the new tenant at Lallybroch went to put the furniture in storage, they couldnâ€™t get that big old desk through the door of the study. So they called an antiques guy to take the thing apartâ€”very carefully, he assured me. And when they did, they found three Queen Victoria stamps and this.



I didnâ€™t read it. If you havenâ€™t left yet, let me know if you want the stamps; Lenny Jr. collects them and will give them a good home, if not.



All my love,



Uncle Joe



She folded the note carefully, pressing the creases, tucking it into her handbag. She felt as though she ought to go somewhere else to read the letter, somewhere private and quiet, so she could go to pieces without anyone noticing. The seal was sooty gray candle wax, not sealing wax, and Roger had sealed it with his thumbprint. It wasnâ€™t necessaryâ€”sheâ€™d recognized the writing immediatelyâ€”but there was no doubt of the tiny hook-shaped scar left when a scaling knife had slipped while he was cleaning a salmon he and Jem had caught in Loch Ness. Sheâ€™d kissed it while the cut was healing, and a dozen times since.

But she couldnâ€™t wait and, hands trembling, opened her pocketknife and carefully pried off the seal, trying not to break it. It was old and brittle; the candle grease had seeped into the paper over the years, making a shadow around the glob of wax, and it shattered in her hand. She clutched the fragments convulsively and turned the folded paper over.

Brianna Randall Fraser MacKenzie, heâ€™d written on the front. To be kept until called for.

That made her laugh, but the sound came out as a sob, and she dashed the back of her hand across her eyes, desperate to read.

The very first words made her drop the letter as though it were on fire.

November 15, 1739



She snatched it back up. Lest she somehow miss it, heâ€™d underlined 1739.

â€œHow in bloody hell did youâ€”â€ she said aloud, and clapped a hand over her mouth, where she kept it as she read the rest.

My Dearest Heart,



I know what youâ€™re thinking, and I donâ€™t know. My best idea is that Iâ€™ve come in search of Jeremiah and found himâ€”or may have found himâ€”but not the person I thought I was looking for.



I sought help at Lallybroch, where I met Brian Fraser (you would like him, and he, you), and through himâ€”with the assistance of one Captain Jack Randall, of all peopleâ€”came into possession of a set of RAF identification disks. I recognized the information on them.



We (Buck is still with me) have been searching for Jem since our arrival and have found no sign at all. I wonâ€™t give upâ€”of course you know thatâ€”but as our inquiries have borne no fruit in the northern clan lands, I feel I must follow the one clue I have and see if I can locate the owner of those tags.



I donâ€™t know what might happen, and I had to leave you some word, however faint the chance that youâ€™ll ever see it.



God bless you and Jemâ€”wherever he is, poor little guy, and I can only hope and pray heâ€™s safeâ€”and my sweet Mandy.



I love you. Iâ€™ll love you forever.



R.



She didnâ€™t realize that she was crying, until the tears running down her face tickled her hand.

â€œOh, Roger,â€ she said. â€œOh, dear God.â€





IN THE LATE evening, with the kids safely asleep and the sound of the Pacific Ocean washing through the open balcony doors, Brianna took out a bound notebook, brand-new, and a Fisher Space Pen (guaranteed to write upside down, underwater, and in conditions of zero gravity), which she thought entirely appropriate to this particular piece of composition.

She sat down under a good light, paused for a moment, then got up and poured a glass of cold white wine, which she set on the table beside her notebook. Sheâ€™d been composing bits of this in her mind all day and so began with no difficulty.

There was no telling how old the kids might be whenâ€”or ifâ€”they read it, so she made no effort to simplify things. It wasnâ€™t a simple matter.

A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR TIME TRAVELERSâ€”PART II

Right. Dadâ€™s written down what we think we know about this, in terms of observation of occurrence, physical effects, and morality. This next part could best be described as preliminary hypotheses of cause: how time travel might work. Iâ€™d call it the scientific part, but you canâ€™t actually apply the scientific method very far with the scanty data we have available.

Any scientific approach starts with observations, though, and we have enough of those to maybe construct a rough series of hypotheses. Testing those . . .

The idea of testing those made Briannaâ€™s hand shake so badly that she was obliged to set down her pen and breathe slowly for two or three minutes, until the black spots stopped swarming in front of her eyes. Gritting her teeth, she wrote:

Hypothesis 1: That the time passages/vortices/whatever the bloody hell they are/ are caused by or occur at the crossing of ley lines. (Defined here as lines of geomagnetic force, rather the folkloric definition of straight map lines drawn between ancient structures like hill forts, henges, or places of ancient worship, like saintsâ€™ pools. Supposition is that folkloric lines may be identical or parallel with geomagnetic lines, but no hard evidence to this effect.)

Evidence in Support of Hypothesis: Some. But to start with, we donâ€™t know whether the standing stones are part of the vortex thingy or just markers set up when ancient people saw other ancient people step on the grass right . . . there . . . and poof!

â€œPoof,â€ she muttered to herself, and reached for the glass of wine. Sheâ€™d planned to drink it as a reward when sheâ€™d finished, but at the moment felt more in need of first aid than reward. â€œI wish it was just poof.â€ One sip, two, then she set it down, the citric edge of the wine lingering pleasantly on her tongue.



â€œWhere were we? Oh, poof . . .â€

Dad was able to connect a lot of the folkloric leys to standing stone circles. It would theoretically be possible to check the geomagnetic polarity of the rock around standing stone circles; that should actually go some way toward supporting Hypothesis 1, but might be a little difficult to execute. That is, you can measure the earthâ€™s magnetic fieldâ€”Carl Friedrich Gauss figured out how to do it back in 1835 or soâ€”but it isnâ€™t the sort of thing individuals do much.

Governments that do geological surveys have the equipment for it; I know the British Geological Surveyâ€™s Eskdalemuir Observatory does, because I saw a write-up on them. And I quote: â€œSuch observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.â€

â€œOther human activities,â€ she muttered. â€œRiiight . . .â€

The army does this sort of thing, too, she wrote as an afterthought. â€œYes, Iâ€™ll get the army right on that. . . .â€

The pen hovered over the page as she thought, but she couldnâ€™t add anything else useful there, and so went on:

Hypothesis 2: That entering a time vortex with a gemstone (preferably faceted, vide remarks made by Geillis Duncan to this effect) offers some protection to the traveler in terms of physical effect.

Query: why facets? We used mostly unfaceted ones coming back through Ocracoke, and we know of other travelers using plain unfaceted ones.

Speculation: Joe Abernathy told me about one of his patients, an archaeologist who told him about some study done on standing stones up in Orkney, where they discovered that the stones have interesting tonal qualities; if you strike them with wooden sticks or other stones, you get a kind of musical note. Any kind of crystalâ€”and all gems have a crystalline interior structureâ€”has a characteristic vibration when struck; thatâ€™s how quartz watches work.

So what if the crystal you carry has vibrations that respond toâ€”or stimulate, for that matterâ€”vibrations in the standing stones nearby? And if they did . . . what might be the physical effect? D.B.K.*

She made a swift note at the bottom of the page: *D.B.K.â€”Donâ€™t Bloody Know, and returned to her writing.

Evidence: There really isnâ€™t any, other than the aforesaid remarks from Geillis Duncan (though she may have noted some anecdotal material in her journals, which youâ€™ll find in the large safe-deposit box at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh. Uncle Joe will have the key or will have made provisions for you to get it).

NB: Grannie Claire traveled the first two times without any stones (though note that she was wearing a gold wedding ring the first time, and a gold and a silver ring on the second journey).

Grannie said that going with a stone seemed slightly easierâ€”but given the subjectivity of the experience, I donâ€™t know how much weight to put on that. Doing it with a stone is the most horrible thing I . . .

Maybe better not to say that. She hesitated for some time, but, after all, her own experiences were data, and given how little there was of it . . . She finished the sentence, then went on.

Hypothesis 3: That traveling with a gemstone allows one better control in choosing where/when to emerge.

She stopped, frowning, and crossed out where. There wasnâ€™t any indication of people traveling between sites. Be bloody handy if they could, though. . . . She sighed and went on.

Evidence: Pretty sketchy, owing to lack of data. We know of a few travelers other than ourselves, and of these, five Native Americans (part of a political group called the Montauk Five) traveled with the use of stones. One of these is known to have died in the attempt, one survived and traveled back about 200 years, and another, a man named Robert Springer (aka â€œOtter-Toothâ€), traveled back more than the usual distance, arriving (approximately) 250â€“260 years prior to his year of departure. We donâ€™t know what happened to the two other members of this group; they may have traveled to a different time and we havenâ€™t found any mention of them (difficult to track down a time traveler, if you donâ€™t know when they may have gone, what their real names are, or what they look like), may have been blown out of the time vortex for unknown reasons, or may have died inside it.

That little possibility unnerved her so much that she set down the pen and took several large swallows of wine before resuming.

By the evidence of Otter-Toothâ€™s journal, these men all did travel with gemstones, and he procured a large opal with which he intended to make the return trip. (This is the stone Jemmy made explode, in North Carolina, presumably because fire opals have a high water content.)

It hadnâ€™tâ€”and, thinking back, she couldnâ€™t imagine how it hadnâ€™tâ€”occurred to her at the time to see whether Jemmy could make water boil by touching it. Well, she could see why it hadnâ€™t occurred to her, in retrospect; the last thing sheâ€™d wanted was any more dangerous peculiarity near her children, much less dangerous peculiarities being inherent in them.

â€œI wonder how often it happens that two time travelers marry each other?â€ she said aloud. No telling what the frequency of the geneâ€”if it was a gene, but that looked to be a decent betâ€”in the general population was, but it couldnâ€™t be very common, or people would be walking into Stonehenge and Callanish and going poof! on a daily basis. . . . â€œSomebody would have noticed,â€ she concluded, and sat twiddling the pen for a bit in meditation.

Might she have met and married Roger if it werenâ€™t for the time-traveling thing? No, because it was her motherâ€™s need to find out what had happened to the men of Lallybroch that had led them to Scotland.

â€œWell, Iâ€™m not sorry,â€ she said aloud to Roger. â€œIn spite of . . . everything.â€

She flexed her fingers and picked up the pen, but didnâ€™t write at once. She hadnâ€™t thought further with her hypotheses and wanted them to be clear in her mind, at least. She had vague notions about how a time vortex might be explained in the context of a unified field theory, but if Einstein couldnâ€™t do it, she didnâ€™t think she was up to it right this minute.

â€œIt has to be in there somewhere, though,â€ she said aloud, and reached for the wine. Einstein had been trying to form a theory that dealt both with relativity and electromagnetism, and plainly they were dealing with relativity hereâ€”but a sort in which it maybe wasnâ€™t the speed of light that was limiting. What, then? The speed of time? The shape of time? Did electromagnetic fields crisscrossing in some places warp that shape?

What about the dates? Everything they thought they knewâ€”precious little as it wasâ€”indicated that travel was easier, safer, on the sun feasts and fire feasts; the solstices and equinoxes. . . . A little ripple ran up her back. A few things were known about standing stone circles, and one of the common things was that many had been built with astronomical prediction in mind. Was the light striking a specific stone the signal that the earth had reached some planetary alignment that affected the geomagnetism of that area?

â€œHuh,â€ she said, and sipped, flipping back over the pages sheâ€™d written. â€œWhat a hodgepodge.â€ This wouldnâ€™t do anyone much good: nothing but disconnected thoughts and things that didnâ€™t even qualify as decent speculation.

Still, her mind wouldnâ€™t let go of the matter. Electromagnetism . . . Bodies had electric fields of their own, she knew that much. Was that maybe why you didnâ€™t just disintegrate when you traveled? Did your own field keep you together, just long enough to pop out again? She supposed that might explain the gemstone thing: you could travel on the strength of your own field, if you were lucky, but the energy released from the molecular bonds in a crystal might well add to that field, so perhaps . . . ?

â€œBugger,â€ she said, her overworked mental processes creaking to a halt. She glanced guiltily at the hallway that led to the kidsâ€™ room. They both knew that word, but they oughtnâ€™t to think their mother did.

She sank back to finish the wine and let her mind roam free, soothed by the sound of the distant surf. Her mind wasnâ€™t interested in water, though; it seemed still concerned with electricity.

â€œI sing the Body Electric,â€ she said softly. â€œThe armies of those I love engirth me.â€

Now, there was a thought. Maybe Walt Whitman had been onto something . . . because if the electric attraction of the armies of those I love had an effect on time-traveling, it would explain the apparent effect of fixing your attention on a specific person, wouldnâ€™t it?

She thought of standing in the stones of Craigh na Dun, thinking of Roger. Or of standing on Ocracoke, mind fixed fiercely on her parentsâ€”sheâ€™d read all the letters now; she knew exactly where they were. . . . Would that make a difference? An instantâ€™s panic, as she tried to visualize her fatherâ€™s face, more as she groped for Rogerâ€™s . . .

The expression of the face balks account. The next line echoed soothingly in her head. But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face;

It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists;



It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and kneesâ€”dress does not hide him;



The strong, sweet supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton and flannel;



To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more;



You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.



She didnâ€™t remember any more, but didnâ€™t need to; her mind had calmed.

â€œIâ€™d know you anywhere,â€ she said softly to her husband, and lifted the remains of her glass. â€œSlÃ inte.â€





NAY GREAT SHORTAGE OF HAIR IN SCOTLAND

MR. CUMBERPATCH proved to be a tall, ascetic person with an incongruous crop of red curls that sat on his head like a small, inquisitive animal. He had, he said, taken the disks in trade for a sucking pig, along with a tin pan whose bottom had been burnt through but could easy be patched, six horseshoes, a looking glass, and half a dresser.

â€œNot really a tinker by trade, see?â€ he said. â€œDonâ€™t travel much. But things come and find me, they do.â€

Evidently they did. Mr. Cumberpatchâ€™s tiny cottage was crammed to its rafters with items that had once been useful and might be so again, once Mr. Cumberpatch got round to fixing them.

â€œSell much?â€ Buck asked, raising an eyebrow at a disassembled carriage clock that sat on the hearth, its internal organs neatly piled into a worn silver comfit dish.

â€œHappen,â€ Mr. Cumberpatch said laconically. â€œSee anything ye like?â€

In the interests of cooperation, Roger haggled politely for a dented canteen and a canvas bed sack with only a few small charred holes at one end, these the result of some soldier taking his rest too close to a campfire. And received in turn the name and general direction of the person from whom Mr. Cumberpatch had got the disks.

â€œFlimsy sort of jewel,â€ his host said, with a shrug. â€œAnd tâ€™old woman said she wouldnâ€™t have it in tâ€™house, all those numbers might be to do with magic, aye? Her not holdinâ€™ with sorcery and tâ€™like.â€

The old woman in question was possibly twenty-five, Roger thought, a tiny, dark-eyed creature like a vole, whoâ€”summoned to provide teaâ€”sized them up with a shrewd glance and proceeded to sell them a small, flabby-looking cheese, four turnips, and a large raisin tart, at an extortionate price. But the price included her own observations on her husbandâ€™s transactionâ€”well worth it, so far as Roger was concerned.

â€œThat ornamentâ€”strange thing, no?â€ she said, narrowing her eyes at the pocket where Roger had replaced it. â€œMan what sold it to Anthony said heâ€™d had it from a hairy man, one of them as lives on the wall.â€

â€œWhich wall would this be, missus?â€ Buck asked, draining his cup and holding it out for more. She gave him a look from her bead-bright eyes, obviously thinking him a simpleton, but they were paying customers, after all. . . .

â€œWhy, the Roman one, to be sure,â€ she said. â€œThey say the old king oâ€™ the Romes put it up, so as to keep the Scots from coming into England.â€ The thought made her grin, small teeth gleaming. â€œAs though anybodyâ€™d want to be a-going there in tâ€™first place!â€

Further questions elicited nothing more; Mrs. Cumberpatch had no idea what was meant by â€œa hairy manâ€; that was what the man said, and she hadnâ€™t wondered about it. Declining an offer from Mr. Cumberpatch for his knife, Roger and Buck took their leave, the food wrapped in the bed sack. But as they did so, Roger saw a pottery dish containing a tangle of chains and tarnished bracelets, and a stray gleam of rainy light struck a tiny red glow.

It must have been Cumberpatchâ€™s description of the disks as a jewelâ€”a common way to refer to a pendant ornamentâ€”that had made his mind sensitive. He stopped and, stirring the dish with a forefinger, drew out a small pendant, blackened, cracked, and with a broken chainâ€”it looked as though it had been in a fireâ€”but set with a fairly large garnet, caked with grime but faceted.

â€œHow much for this?â€ he said.



IT WAS DARK by four oâ€™clock, and long cold nights to be sleeping out of doors, but Rogerâ€™s sense of urgency drove them on, and they found themselves benighted on a lonely road, with nothing but a wind-gnarled Caledonian pine for shelter. Starting a fire with tinder and damp pine needles was no joke, but after all, Roger reflected, grimly bashing steel and flint for the hundredth timeâ€”and his finger for the twentiethâ€”they had nothing but time.

Buck had, with a forethought born of painful experience, brought a sack of peats, and after a quarter hour of frantic blowing on sparks and thrusting grass-stems and pine needles into the infant flame, they succeeded in getting two of these miserable objects to burn with sufficient heat as to roastâ€”or at least searâ€”the turnips and warm their fingers, if not the rest of them.

There hadnâ€™t been any conversation since theyâ€™d left the Cumberpatch establishment: impossible to talk with the cold wind whistling past their ears as they rode, and no breath with which to do it during the struggle with fire and food.

â€œWhatâ€™ll you do if we find him?â€ Buck asked suddenly, mid-turnip. â€œIf J. W. MacKenzie really is your father, I mean.â€

â€œIâ€™ve spegâ€â€”Rogerâ€™s throat was clogged from the cold and he coughed and spat, resuming hoarselyâ€”â€œspent the last three days wondering that, and the answer is, I donâ€™t know.â€

Buck grunted and unwrapped the raisin tart from the bed sack, divided it carefully, and handed Roger half.

It wasnâ€™t bad, though Mrs. Cumberpatch couldnâ€™t be said to have a light hand with pastry.

â€œFilling,â€ Roger remarked, thriftily dabbing crumbs off his coat and eating them. â€œDâ€™ye not want to go, then?â€

Buck shook his head. â€œNay, I canna think of anything better to do. As ye sayâ€”itâ€™s the only clue there is, even if it doesna seem to have aught to do with the wee lad.â€

â€œMmphm. And thereâ€™s the one good thingâ€”we can head straight south to the wall; we neednâ€™t waste time looking for the man Cumberpatch got the disks from.â€

â€œAye,â€ Buck said dubiously. â€œAnd then what? Walk the length of it, askinâ€™ after a hairy man? How many oâ€™ those do ye think there might be? Nay great shortage of hair in Scotland, I mean.â€

â€œIf we have to,â€ Roger said shortly. â€œBut if J. W. MacKenzieâ€”and not just his identity disksâ€”was anywhere in the neighborhood, Iâ€™m thinking he would have caused a good bit of talk.â€

â€œMmphm. And how longâ€™s this wall, dâ€™ye know?â€

â€œI do, yes. Or, rather,â€ Roger corrected, â€œI know how long it was when it was built: eighty Roman miles. A Roman mile being just slightly shorter than an English one. No idea how much of itâ€™s still there now, though. Most of it, likely.â€

Buck grimaced. â€œWell, say we can walk fifteen, twenty miles in a dayâ€”the walkinâ€™ will be easy, if itâ€™s along a bloody wallâ€”thatâ€™s only four days to cover the lot. Though . . .â€ A thought struck him and he frowned, pushing his damp forelock back. â€œThatâ€™s if we could walk from end to end. If we hit it midway, though, what then? We might cover half and find nothing, and then have to go all the way back to where we started.â€ He looked accusingly at Roger.

Roger rubbed a hand over his face. It was coming on to rain, and the mizzle was misting on his skin.



â€œIâ€™ll think about it tomorrow, aye?â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™ll have plenty of time to make plans on our way.â€ He reached for the canvas bed sack, shook out a limp turnip frond and ate it, then pulled the sack over his head and shoulders. â€œWant to join me under this, or are ye for bed?â€

â€œNay, Iâ€™m all right.â€ Buck pulled his slouch hat lower and sat hunched, toes as close to the remnants of the fire as he could get.

Roger drew his knees up and tucked in the ends of the bed sack. The rain made a gentle pittering on the canvas, and in the fatigue of exhaustion and cold, but with the comfort of a full stomach, he allowed himself the further comfort of imagining Bree. He did this only at night but looked forward to it with a greater anticipation than he did supper.

He envisioned her in his arms, sitting between his knees, her head lying back on his shoulder, snug under the canvas with him and her soft hair span-gled with raindrops that caught the faint light of the fire. Warm, solid, breathing against his chest, his heart slowing to beat with hers . . .

â€œI wonder what Iâ€™d say to my own father,â€ Buck said suddenly. â€œHad I ever kent him, I mean.â€ He blinked at Roger from under the shadowed brim of his hat. â€œDid yoursâ€”does he, I meanâ€”know about you?â€

Roger suppressed his annoyance at being disturbed in his fantasy, but answered shortly. â€œYes. I was born before he disappeared.â€

â€œOh.â€ Buck rocked back a little, looking meditative, but said no more. Roger found, though, that the interruption had made his wife vanish. He concentrated, trying to bring her back, imagining her in the kitchen at Lallybroch, the steam of cooking rising up around her, making wisps of red hair curl round her face and moisture gleam on the long straight bridge of her nose . . .

What he was hearing, though, was her arguing with him about whether he should tell Buck the truth of his begetting.

â€œDonâ€™t you think he has a right to know?â€ sheâ€™d said. â€œWouldnâ€™t you want to know something like that?â€

â€œActually, I donâ€™t think I would,â€ heâ€™d said at the time. But now . . .

â€œDo you know who your father was?â€ Roger asked suddenly. The question had been in his mind for months, he unsure whether he had any right to ask it.

Buck gave him a baffled, faintly hostile glance.

â€œWhat the devil dâ€™ye mean by that? Of course I doâ€”or did. Heâ€™s dead now.â€ His face twisted suddenly, realizing. â€œOrâ€”â€

â€œOr maybe heâ€™s not, since yeâ€™re not born yet. Aye, it gets to ye after a bit, doesnâ€™t it?â€

Apparently, it had just gotten to Buck. He stood up abruptly and stalked off. He stayed gone for a good ten minutes, giving Roger time to regret saying anything. But at last Buck came out of the dark and sat down again by the smoldering peat. He sat with his knees pulled up, arms locked round them.

â€œWhat did ye mean by that?â€ he asked abruptly. â€œDid I ken my father, and that.â€

Roger took in a deep breath of damp grass, pine needles, and peat smoke. â€œI mean ye werena born to the house ye grew up in. Did ye ken that?â€

Buck looked wary and slightly bewildered. â€œAye,â€ he said slowly. â€œOrâ€” not kent it straight out, I mean. My parents didna have any bairns besides me, so I thought there was maybeâ€”well, I thought I was likely a bastard born to my fatherâ€™s sister. She died, they said, about the time I was born, and she wasna marrit, so . . .â€ He shrugged, one-shouldered. â€œSo, no.â€ He turned his head and looked at Roger, expressionless. â€œHow dâ€™ye come to know, yourself?â€

â€œBriannaâ€™s mother.â€ He felt a sharp, sudden longing for Claire and was surprised at it. â€œShe was a traveler. But she was at Leoch, about that time. And she told us what happened.â€ He had the hollow-bellied feel of one about to jump off a precipice into water of unknown depth, but there was no way to stop now.

â€œYour father was Dougal MacKenzie of Castle Leochâ€”war chieftain of the clan MacKenzie. And your mother was a witch named Geillis.â€

Buckâ€™s face was absolutely blank, the faint firelight shimmering on the broad cheekbones that were his fatherâ€™s legacy. Roger wanted suddenly to go and take the man in his arms, smooth the hair back from his face, comfort him like a childâ€”like the child he could so plainly see in those wide, stunned green eyes. Instead, he got up and went off into the night, giving his four-times great-grandfather what privacy he could in which to deal with the news.



IT HADNâ€™T HURT. Roger woke coughing, and drops of moisture rolled tickling down his temples, dislodged by the motion. He was sleeping under the empty canvas bed sack rather than on it, valuing its water-resilience more than its potential comfort when stuffed with grass, but he hadnâ€™t been able to bear having it over his head.

He put a hand cautiously to his throat, feeling the thickened line of the rope scar cutting across the lower swell of his larynx. He rolled over, lifted himself on one elbow, and cleared his throat experimentally. It didnâ€™t hurt this time, either.

â€œDo you know what a hyoid bone is?â€ He did; as a result of a number of medical consultations about his damaged voice, he understood the anatomy of his throat quite well. And thus had known what Dr. McEwan meant; his own hyoid was placed slightly higher and farther back than the usual, a fortunate circumstance that had saved his life when he was hanged, as the crushing of that wee bone would have suffocated him.

Had he been dreaming of McEwan? Or of being hanged? Yes, that. Heâ€™d had dreams like that often in the months afterward, though theyâ€™d grown less frequent in later years. But he remembered looking up through the lacy branches of the tree, seeingâ€”in the dreamâ€”the rope tied to the branch above him, and the desperate struggle to scream a protest through the gag in his mouth. Then the ineluctable sliding under him as the horse he sat on was led away . . . but this time it hadnâ€™t hurt. His feet had struck the ground and he wakedâ€”but waked without the choking or the burning, stabbing sensations that left him gasping and gritting his teeth.

He glanced across; yes, Buck was still there, huddled up under the ragged plaid heâ€™d bought from Cumberpatch. Wise purchase.



He lay back down on his side, hauling the canvas up to shield his face while still allowing him to breathe. Heâ€™d admit to a feeling of relief at seeing Buck; heâ€™d half-expected the man to decamp and head straight back to Castle Leoch after hearing the truth about his own family. Though, in justice to Buck, he wasnâ€™t a sneak. If heâ€™d made up his mind to do that, heâ€™d likely say soâ€”after punching Roger in the nose for not telling him sooner.

As it was, heâ€™d been there, staring into the ashes of the fire when Roger came back. He hadnâ€™t looked up, and Roger hadnâ€™t said anything to him but had sat down and taken out needle and thread to mend a rip in the seam of his coat.

After a bit, though, Buck had stirred himself.

â€œWhy wait to tell me now?â€ heâ€™d asked quietly. His voice held no particular note of accusation. â€œWhy not tell me while we were still near Leoch and Cranesmuir?â€

â€œI hadnâ€™t made up my mind to tell ye at all,â€ Roger had said bluntly. â€œIt was just thinking aboutâ€”well, about what weâ€™re doing and what might happen. I thought of a sudden that maybe ye should know. And . . .â€ He hesitated for a moment. â€œI didnâ€™t plan it, but itâ€™s maybe better so. Yeâ€™ll have time to think, maybe, whether ye want to find your parents before we go back.â€

Buck had merely grunted in reply to that and said no more. But it wasnâ€™t Buckâ€™s response that was occupying Rogerâ€™s mind at the moment.

It hadnâ€™t hurt when heâ€™d cleared his throat while talking to Buck, though he hadnâ€™t noticed consciously at the time.

McEwanâ€”was it what heâ€™d done, his touch? Roger wished heâ€™d been able to see whether McEwanâ€™s hand shed blue light when heâ€™d touched Rogerâ€™s damaged throat.

And what about that light? He thought that Claire had mentioned something like it onceâ€”oh, yes, describing how Master Raymond had healed her, following the miscarriage sheâ€™d had in Paris. Seeing her bones glow blue inside her body was how sheâ€™d put it, he thought.

Now, that was a staggering thoughtâ€”was it a familial trait, common to time travelers? He yawned hugely and swallowed once more, experimentally. No pain.

He couldnâ€™t keep track of his thoughts any longer. Felt sleep spreading through his body like good whisky, warming him. And let go, finally, wondering what he might say to his father. If . . .





A MAN TO DO A MANâ€™S JOB

Boston, MA

December 8, 1980

GAIL ABERNATHY provided a quick but solid supper of spaghetti with meatballs, salad, garlic bread, andâ€”after a quick, penetrating look at Breeâ€”a bottle of wine, despite Briannaâ€™s protests.

â€œYouâ€™re spending the night here,â€ Gail said, in a tone brooking no opposition, and pointed at the bottle. â€œAnd youâ€™re drinking that. I donâ€™t know what youâ€™ve been doing to yourself, girl, and you donâ€™t need to tell meâ€”but you need to stop doing it.â€

â€œI wish I could.â€ But her heart had risen the moment she walked through the familiar door, and her sense of agitation did subsideâ€”though it was far from disappearing. The wine helped, though.

The Abernathys helped more. Just the sense of being with friends, of not being alone with the kids and the fear and uncertainty. She went from wanting to cry to wanting to laugh and back again in the space of seconds, and felt that if Gail and Joe had not been there, she might have had no choice but to go into the bathroom, turn on the shower, and scream into a folded bath towelâ€”her only safety valve in the last few days.

But now there was at least someone to talk to. She didnâ€™t know whether Joe could offer anything beyond a sympathetic ear, but at the moment that was worth more to her than anything.

Conversation over dinner was light and kid-oriented, Gail asking Mandy whether she liked Barbies and whether her Barbie had a car, and Joe talking soccer versus baseballâ€”Jem was a hard-core Red Sox fan, being allowed to stay up to ungodly hours to listen to rare radio broadcasts with his mother. Brianna contributed nothing more than the occasional smile and felt the tension slowly leave her neck and shoulders.

It came back, though with less force, when dinner was over and Mandyâ€”half-asleep with her arm in her plateâ€”was carried off to bed by Gail, humming â€œJesu, Joy of Manâ€™s Desiringâ€ in a voice like a cello. Bree rose to pick up the dirty plates, but Joe waved her back, rising from his chair.

â€œLeave them, darlinâ€™. Come talk to me in the den. Bring the rest of the wine,â€ he added, then smiled at Jem. â€œJem, whynâ€™t you go up and ask Gail can you watch TV in the bedroom?â€

Jem had a smudge of spaghetti sauce at the corner of his mouth, and his hair was sticking up on one side in porcupine spikes. He was a little pale from the journey, but the food had restored him and his eyes were bright, alert.

â€œNo, sir,â€ he said respectfully, and pushed back his own chair. â€œIâ€™ll stay with my mam.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t need to do that, honey,â€ she said. â€œUncle Joe and I have grown-up things we need to talk about. Youâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™m staying.â€

She gave him a hard look, but recognized instantly, with a combination of horror and fascination, a Fraser male with his mind made up.

His lower lip was trembling, just a little. He shut his mouth hard to stop it and looked soberly from her to Joe, then back.

â€œDadâ€™s not here,â€ he said, and swallowed. â€œAnd neither is Grandda. Iâ€™m . . . Iâ€™m staying.â€

She couldnâ€™t speak. Joe nodded, though, as soberly as Jem, took a can of Coke from the refrigerator, and led the way to the den. She followed them, clutching the wine bottle and two glasses.

â€œBree, darlinâ€™?â€ Joe turned back for a moment. â€œGet another bottle from the cupboard over the stove. This is gonna take some talking.â€

It did. Jemmy was on his second Cokeâ€”the question of his going to bed, let alone to sleep, was clearly academicâ€”and the second bottle of wine was one-third down before sheâ€™d finished describing the situationâ€”all the situationsâ€”and what she thought of doing about them.

â€œOkay,â€ Joe said, quite casually. â€œI donâ€™t believe Iâ€™m saying this, but you need to decide whether to go through some rocks in North Carolina or in Scotland and end up in the eighteenth century either way, is that it?â€

â€œThatâ€™s . . . most of it.â€ She took a swallow of wine; it seemed to steady her. â€œBut thatâ€™s the first thing, yes. See, I know where Mama and Da areâ€”wereâ€”at the end of 1778, and thatâ€™s the year weâ€™d go back to, if everything works the way it seems to have worked before. Theyâ€™ll either be back on Fraserâ€™s Ridge or on their way there.â€

Jemâ€™s face lightened a little at that, but he didnâ€™t say anything. She met his eyes directly.

â€œI was going to take you and Mandy through the stones on Ocracokeâ€”where we came through before, you remember? On the island?â€

â€œVroom,â€ he said very softly, and broke into a sudden grin, reliving his first exposure to automobiles.

â€œYes,â€ she said, smiling back despite herself. â€œThen we could go to the Ridge, and I was going to leave you with Grannie and Grandda while I went to Scotland to find Daddy.â€

Jemâ€™s smile faded, and his red brows drew together.

â€œPardon my pointing out the obvious,â€ Joe said. â€œBut wasnâ€™t there a war going on in 1778?â€

â€œThere was,â€ she said tersely. â€œAnd, yes, it might be a little bit difficult to get a ship from North Carolina to Scotland, but believe you me, I could do it.â€

â€œOh, I do,â€ he assured her. â€œIt would be easierâ€”and safer, I reckonâ€”than going through in Scotland and searching for Roger with Jem and Mandy to look after at the same time, butâ€”â€



â€œI donâ€™t need looking after!â€

â€œMaybe not,â€ Joe told him, â€œbut you got about six years, sixty pounds, and another two feet to grow before you can look after your mama. â€™Til you get big enough that nobody can just pick you up and carry you off, sheâ€™s got to worry about you.â€

Jem looked as if he wanted to argue the point, but he was at the age where logic did sometimes prevail, and happily this was one of those times. He made a small â€œmmphmâ€ sound in his throat, which startled Bree, and sat back on the ottoman, still frowning.

â€œBut you canâ€™t go to where Grannie and Grandda are,â€ he pointed out. â€œ â€™Cuz Dadâ€™s not whereâ€”I mean whenâ€”you thought. Heâ€™s not in the same time they are.â€

â€œBingo,â€ she said briefly, and, reaching into the pocket of her sweater, carefully withdrew the plastic bag protecting Rogerâ€™s letter. She handed it to Joe. â€œRead that.â€

He whipped his reading glasses out of his own pocket and, with them perched on his nose, read the letter carefully, looked up at her, wide-eyed, then bent his head and read it again. After which he sat quite still for several minutes, staring into space, the letter open on his knee.

At last, he heaved a sigh, folded the letter carefully, and handed it back to her.

â€œSo now itâ€™s space and time,â€ he said. â€œYou ever watch Doctor Who on PBS?â€

â€œAll the time,â€ she said dryly, â€œon the BBC. And donâ€™t think I wouldnâ€™t sell my soul for a TARDIS.â€

Jem made the little Scottish noise again, and Brianna looked sideways at him.

â€œAre you doing that on purpose?â€

He looked up at her, surprised. â€œDoing what?â€

â€œNever mind. When you are fifteen, Iâ€™m locking you in the cellar.â€

â€œWhat? Why?â€ he demanded indignantly.

â€œBecause thatâ€™s when your father and grandfather started getting into real trouble, and evidently youâ€™re going to be just like them.â€

â€œOh.â€ He seemed pleased to hear this, and subsided.

â€œWell, putting aside the possibility of getting hold of a working TARDIS . . .â€ Joe leaned forward, topping up both glasses of wine. â€œItâ€™s possible to travel farther than you thought, because Roger and this Buck guy just did it. So you think you could do it, too?â€

â€œIâ€™ve got to,â€ she said simply. â€œHe wonâ€™t try to come back without Jem, so I have to go find him.â€

â€œDo you know how he did it? You told me it took gemstones to do it. Did he have, like, a special kind of gem?â€

â€œNo.â€ She frowned, remembering the effort of using the kitchen shears to snip apart the old brooch with its scatter of chip-like diamonds. â€œThey each had a few tiny little diamondsâ€”but Roger went through before with a single biggish diamond. He said it was like the other times we know about; it exploded or vaporized or somethingâ€”just a smear of soot in his pocket.â€

â€œMmm.â€ Joe took a sip of wine and held it meditatively in his mouth for a moment before swallowing. â€œHypothesis one, then: number is more important than sizeâ€”i.e., you can go farther if you have more stones in your pocket.â€

She stared at him for a moment, somewhat taken aback.

â€œI hadnâ€™t thought of that,â€ she said slowly. â€œThe first time he tried it, though . . . he had his motherâ€™s locket; that had garnets on it. Definitely garnets, plural. But he didnâ€™t get throughâ€”he was thrown back, on fire.â€ She shuddered briefly, the sudden vision of Mandy flung on the ground, burning . . . She gulped wine and coughed. â€œSoâ€”so we donâ€™t know whether he might have gone farther if he had gone through.â€

â€œItâ€™s just a thought,â€ Joe said mildly, watching her. â€œNow . . . Rogerâ€™s mentioning Jeremiah here, and it sounds like he means thereâ€™s somebody besides Jemmy whoâ€™s got that name. Do you know what he means?â€

â€œI do.â€ A skitter of something between fear and excitement ran down her back with icy little feet, and she took another swallow of wine and a deep breath before telling him about Jerry MacKenzie. The circumstances of his disappearanceâ€”and what her mother had told Roger.

â€œShe thought he was very likely an accidental traveler. One whoâ€”who couldnâ€™t get back.â€ She took another quick sip.

â€œThatâ€™s my other grandda?â€ Jemmy asked. His face flushed a little at the thought and he sat forward, hands clutched between his thighs. â€œIf we go where Dad is, will we get to meet him, too?â€

â€œI canâ€™t even think about that,â€ she told him honestly, though the suggestion made her insides curl up. Among the million alarming contingencies of the current situation, the possibility of meeting her deceased father-in-law face-to-face was about 999,999th on the list of Things to Be Worried Aboutâ€”but apparently it was on the list.

â€œBut what did Roger mean about seeking Jeremiah?â€ Joe asked, clinging stubbornly to the point.

â€œWe think thatâ€™s how you . . . steer,â€ Brianna said. â€œFocusing your thoughts on a particular person whoâ€™s in the time you want to go to. We donâ€™t know that for sure, though,â€ she added, and stifled a small belch. â€œEach time weâ€”or Mamaâ€”did it, it was always two hundred and two years. And it was when Mama went back the first timeâ€”though come to think of it,â€ she added, frowning, â€œshe thought it might have been because Black Jack Randallâ€”Daddyâ€™s ancestorâ€”was there. He was the first person she met when she came through the stones. She said he looked a lot like Daddy.â€

â€œUh-huh.â€ Joe poured another half glass and stared at it for a moment, as though hypnotized by the soft reddish light glowing in its bowl. â€œBut.â€ He stopped, marshaling his thoughts. â€œBut other people did go farther. This Geillis your mother mentioned, and Buck? Did heâ€”never mind. Roger and Buck did do it this time, for sure. So itâ€™s possible; we just donâ€™t know how.â€

â€œI was forgetting Geillis,â€ Bree said slowly. Sheâ€™d seen the woman only once, and very briefly. A tall, slender figure, fair hair flying in the wind of a murderous fire, her shadow thrown onto one of the standing stones, enormous, elongated.

â€œNow that I think, though . . . I donâ€™t believe she had gemstones when she went back. She thought it took . . . er . . . sacrifice.â€ She glanced at Jem, then looked at Joe, lowering her brows with a meaningful look that said, â€œDonâ€™t ask.â€ â€œAnd fire. And she never came back the other way, though she planned to, with stones.â€ And suddenly a penny that she hadnâ€™t known was there dropped. â€œShe told Mama about using stonesâ€”not the other way around. So somebody . . . somebody else told her.â€

Joe digested that one for a moment, but then shook his head, dismissing the distraction.

â€œHuh. Okay, Hypothesis two: focusing your thoughts on a particular person helps you go to where they are. That make sense to you, Jem?â€ he asked, turning to Jemmy, who nodded.

â€œSure. If itâ€™s somebody you know.â€

â€œOkay. Thenâ€”â€ Joe stopped abruptly, looking at Jem. â€œIf itâ€™s somebody you know?â€

The icy centipede came rippling up Breeâ€™s backbone and into her hair, making her scalp contract.

â€œJem.â€ Her voice sounded odd to her own ears, husky and half breathless. â€œMandy says she can hear youâ€”in her head. Can you . . . hear her?â€ She swallowed, hard, and her voice came clearer. â€œCan you hear Daddy that way?â€

The small red brows drew together in a puzzled frown.

â€œSure. Canâ€™t you?â€



THE DEEP LINE between Uncle Joeâ€™s eyebrows hadnâ€™t gone away since the night before, Jem saw. He still looked friendly; he nodded at Jem and pushed a cup of hot chocolate across the counter to him, but his eyes kept going back to Mam, and every time they did, the line got deeper.

Mam was buttering Mandyâ€™s toast. Jem thought she wasnâ€™t as worried as she had been, and felt a little better himself. Heâ€™d slept all night, for the first time in a long time, and he thought maybe Mam had, too. No matter how tired he was, he usually woke up every couple of hours, listening out for noises, and then listening harder to be sure Mandy and Mam were still breathing. He had nightmares where they werenâ€™t.

â€œSo, Jem,â€ Uncle Joe said. He put down his coffee cup and patted his lips with a paper napkin left over from Halloween; it was black with orange jack-oâ€™-lanterns and white ghosts on it. â€œUm . . . how far can you . . . er . . . you know, when your sisterâ€™s not with you?â€

â€œHow far?â€ Jem said uncertainly, and looked at Mam. It hadnâ€™t ever occurred to him to wonder.

â€œIf you went in the living room right now,â€ Uncle Joe said, nodding at the door. â€œCould you tell she was in here, even if you didnâ€™t know she was in here?â€

â€œYeah. I mean, yes, sir. I think so.â€ He stuck his finger in the hot chocolate: still too hot to drink. â€œWhen I was in the tunnel, in the trainâ€”I knew she was . . . somewhere. Itâ€™s not like science fiction or anything, I mean,â€ he added, trying to explain. â€œNot like X-rays or phasers or like that. I just . . .â€ He struggled for an explanation and finally jerked his head at Mam, who was staring at him with a serious kind of look that bothered him a little. â€œI mean, if you closed your eyes, youâ€™d still know Mam was here, wouldnâ€™t you? Itâ€™s like that.â€

Mam and Uncle Joe looked at each other.

â€œWant toast?â€ Mandy thrust her half-gnawed piece of buttered toast at him. He took it and had a bite; it was good, squidgy white bread, not the home-baked brown kind Mam made, with gritty bits in it.

â€œIf he could hear herâ€”sense herâ€”from the tunnel while she was at home, he can do it for a good long way,â€ Mam said. â€œBut I donâ€™t know for sure that she was at home thenâ€”I was driving all over with her, looking for Jem. And Mandy could sense him while we were in the car that night. Butâ€”â€ Now her eyebrows went together. He didnâ€™t like seeing a line there. â€œShe was telling me she was getting colder, when we drove toward Inverness, but I donâ€™t know if she meant she couldnâ€™t hear him at all, or . . .â€

â€œI donâ€™t think I can feel her when Iâ€™m at school,â€ Jem said, anxious to be helpful. â€œBut Iâ€™m not sure, â€™cause I donâ€™t think about her at school.â€

â€œHow farâ€™s the school from your place?â€ Uncle Joe asked. â€œYou want a Pop-Tart, princess?â€

â€œYes!â€ Mandyâ€™s buttery round face lighted up, but Jem glanced at Mam. Mam looked as if she wanted to kick Uncle Joe under the counter for a second, but then she glanced down at Mandy and her face went all soft.

â€œAll right,â€ she said, and Jem felt a fluttery, excited sort of feeling in his middle. Mam was telling Uncle Joe how far the school was, but Jem wasnâ€™t paying attention. They were going to do it. They were really going to do it!

Because the only reason Mam would let Mandy eat Pop-Tarts without a fuss was because she figured sheâ€™d never get to eat another one.

â€œCan I have one, too, Uncle Joe?â€ he asked. â€œI like the blueberry ones.â€





THE WALL

HADRIANâ€™S WALL looked very much as Roger recalled it from a long-ago school trip. A huge thing, standing nearly fifteen feet high and eight feet wide, double stone walls filled with rubble in between, winding off into the distance.

The people were not that much different, eitherâ€”at least in terms of speech and livelihood. They raised cattle and goats, and the Northumberland dialect had apparently not developed much since Geoffrey Chaucerâ€™s time. Roger and Buckâ€™s Highland accents elicited slit-eyed looks of suspicious incomprehension, and they were for the most part reduced to basic gestures and sign language in order to obtain food andâ€”occasionallyâ€”shelter.

With a bit of trial and error, Roger did work out an approximate Middle English for â€œHast come here a stranger?â€ From the looks of the placeâ€”and the looks he and Buck were gettingâ€”he would have said the contingency was remote, and so it proved. Three days of walking, and they were still plainly the strangest men anyone near the wall had ever seen.

â€œSurely a man dressed in RAF uniform would look even more peculiar than we do?â€ he said to Buck.

â€œHe would,â€ Buck replied logically, â€œif he was still wearing it.â€

Roger grunted in chagrin. He hadnâ€™t thought of the possibility that Jerry might have discarded his uniform on purposeâ€”or been deprived of it by whomever came across him first.

It was on the fourth dayâ€”the wall itself had rather surprisingly changed, being no longer built of stone and rubble but of stacked turvesâ€”that they met a man wearing Jerry MacKenzieâ€™s flight jacket.

The man was standing at the edge of a half-plowed field, staring morosely into the distance, apparently with nothing on his mind save his hair. Roger froze, hand on Buckâ€™s arm, compelling him to look.

â€œJesus,â€ Buck whispered, grabbing Rogerâ€™s hand. â€œI didnâ€™t believe it. Thatâ€™s it! Isnâ€™t it?â€ he asked, turning to Roger, brows raised. â€œI meanâ€”the way ye described it . . .â€

â€œYes. It is.â€ Roger felt his throat tighten with excitementâ€”and fear. But there was only the one thing to be done, regardless, and, dropping Buckâ€™s hand, he forged through the dead grass and scattered rock toward the farmer, if thatâ€™s what he was.

The man heard them coming and turned casuallyâ€”then stiffened, seeing them, and looked wildly round for help.

â€œEevis!â€ he shouted, or so Roger thought. Looking over his shoulder, Roger saw the stone walls of a house, evidently built into the wall.

â€œPut up your hands,â€ Roger said to Buck, throwing up his own, palm out, to show his lack of threat. They advanced slowly, hands up, and the farmer stood his ground, though watching them as though they might explode if they got too close.

Roger smiled at the man and elbowed Buck in the ribs to make him do likewise.

â€œGud morn,â€ he said clearly and carefully. â€œHast cum a stranger here?â€ He pointed to his own coatâ€”and then to the flight jacket. His heart was thumping hard; he wanted to knock the man over and strip it off his back, but that wouldnâ€™t do.

â€œNaow!â€ said the man quickly, backing away, holding on to the edges of the jacket. â€œBegone!â€

â€œWe mean ye no harm, daftie,â€ Buck said, in as conciliating a tone as he could manage. He patted the air in a soothing manner. â€œKenst du dee mann . . . ?â€

â€œWhat the bloody hell is that?â€ Roger asked, out of the side of his mouth. â€œAncient Norse?â€



â€œI donâ€™t know, but I heard an Orkneyman say it once. It meansâ€”â€

â€œI can tell what it means. Does this look like Orkney to you?â€

â€œNo. But if you can tell what it means, maybe he can, too, aye?â€

â€œNaow!â€ the man repeated, and bellowed, â€œEEVIS!â€ again. He began to back away from them.

â€œWait!â€ said Roger. â€œLook.â€ He fumbled quickly in his pocket and withdrew the little oilcloth packet holding his fatherâ€™s identity disks. He pulled them out, dangling them in the chilly breeze. â€œSee? Where is the man who wore these?â€

The farmerâ€™s eyes bulged, and he turned and ran clumsily, his clogs hindering him through the clods of the field, shouting, â€œEevis! Hellup!â€ and several other, less comprehensible things.

â€œDo we want to wait for Eevis to turn up?â€ Buck said, shifting uneasily. â€œHe may not be friendly.â€

â€œYes, we do,â€ Roger said firmly. The blood was high in his chest and face, and he flexed his hands nervously. Close. They were so closeâ€”and yet . . . his spirits went from exhilaration to plunging fear and back within seconds. It hadnâ€™t escaped him that there was a strong possibility that Jerry MacKenzie had been killed for that jacketâ€”a possibility that seemed much more likely in view of their interlocutorâ€™s precipitate flight.

The man had disappeared into a windbreak of small trees, beyond which some sheds were visible. Perhaps Eevis was a stockman or dairyman?

Then the barking started.

Buck turned to look at Roger.

â€œEevis, ye think?â€

â€œJesus Christ!â€

A huge, broad-headed, barrel-chested brown dog with a broad, toothy jaw to match came galloping out of the trees and made for them, its proprietor bringing up the rear with a spade.

They ran for it, circling the house with Eevis on their heels, baying for blood. The broad green bank of the wall loomed up in front of Roger and he leapt for it, jamming the toes of his boots into the turf and scrabbling with fingers, knees, elbowsâ€”and likely his teeth, too. He hurled himself over the top and bounced down the far side, landing with a tooth-rattling thud. He was fighting to draw breath when Buck landed on top of him.

â€œShit,â€ his ancestor said briefly, rolling off him. â€œCome on!â€ He jerked Roger to his feet and they ran, hearing the farmer shouting curses at them from the top of the wall.

They found refuge in the lee of a crag a few hundred yards beyond the wall and collapsed there, gasping.

â€œThe Emp . . . Emperor Had . . . rian kent what the blood . . . y hell he . . . was about,â€ Roger managed, at last.

Buck nodded, wiping sweat from his face. â€œNo . . . very hospitable,â€ he wheezed. He shook his head and gulped air. â€œWhat . . . now?â€

Roger patted the air, indicating the need for oxygen before he could formulate ideas, and they sat quiet for a bit, breathing. Roger tried to be logical about it, though spikes of adrenaline kept interfering with his thought processes.



One: Jerry MacKenzie had been here. That was all but certain; it was beyond the bounds of probability that there should be two displaced travelers wearing RAF flight jackets.

Two: he wasnâ€™t here now. Could that be safely deduced? No, Roger concluded reluctantly, it couldnâ€™t. He might have traded the jacket to Eevisâ€™s owner for food or something, in which case heâ€™d likely moved on. But if that were the case, why had the farmer not simply said so, rather than setting the dog on them?

And if heâ€™d stolen the jacket . . . either Jerry was dead and buried somewhere nearbyâ€”that thought made Rogerâ€™s stomach clench and the hairs prickle on his jawâ€”or heâ€™d been assaulted and stripped but perhaps had escaped.

All right. If Jerry was here, he was dead. And if so, the only way of finding out was to subdue the dog and then beat the information out of Eevisâ€™s owner. He didnâ€™t feel quite up to it at the moment.

â€œHeâ€™s not here,â€ Roger said hoarsely. His breathing was still hard, but regular now.

Buck gave him a quick look, but then nodded. There was a long streak of muddy green down his cheek, smeared moss from the wall that echoed the green of his eyes.

â€œAye. What next, then?â€

The sweat was cooling on Rogerâ€™s neck; he wiped it absently with the end of the scarf that had somehow made it over the wall with him.

â€œIâ€™ve got an idea. Given the reaction of our friend thereâ€â€”he nodded in the direction of the farmstead, invisible beyond the green mass of the wallâ€”â€œIâ€™m thinking that asking for a stranger might be not the wisest thing. But what about the stones?â€

Buck blinked at him in incomprehension.

â€œStones?â€

â€œAye. Standing stones. Jerry did travel, we ken that much. Whatâ€™re the odds he came through a circle? And if so . . . theyâ€™re likely none so far away. And folk wouldnâ€™t be threatened, I think, by two dafties asking after stones. If we find the place he likely came through, then we can start to cast out from there and ask at the places nearest to the stones. Cautiously.â€

Buck tapped his fingers on his knee, considering, then nodded.

â€œA standing stone isna like to bite the arses out of our breeks. All right, then; letâ€™s go.â€





RADAR

Boston

December 9, 1980

JEM FELT NERVOUS. Mam and Uncle Joe were both trying to act as if everything was okay, but even Mandy could tell something was up; she was squirming around in the backseat of Uncle Joeâ€™s Cadillac like she had ants in her pants, pulling up her buttoned sweater over her head so her black curls fluffed out of the neckhole like something boiling over.

â€œSit still,â€ he muttered to her, but he didnâ€™t expect her to, and she didnâ€™t.

Uncle Joe was driving, and Mam had a map open in her lap. â€œWhat are you doing, Mandy?â€ Mam said absently. She was making marks on the map with a pencil.

Mandy unbuckled her seat belt and popped up on her knees. Sheâ€™d pulled her arms out of her sweater so they flopped around, and now just her face was poking out of the neckhole.

â€œIâ€™m an ottopus!â€ she said, and shook herself so the sweaterâ€™s arms danced. Jem laughed, in spite of himself. So did Mam, but she waved Mandy back down.

â€œOctopus,â€ she said. â€œAnd put your seat belt back on right now. Octo means eight in Latin,â€ she added. â€œOctopuses have eight legs. Or arms, maybe.â€

â€œYouâ€™ve only got four,â€ Jem said to Mandy. â€œDoes that make her a tetrapus, Mam?â€

â€œMaybe.â€ But Mam had gone back to her map. â€œThe Common, do you think?â€ she said to Uncle Joe. â€œItâ€™s a little more than a quarter mile across the longest axis. And we could go down into the Public Garden, if . . .â€

â€œYeah, good idea. Iâ€™ll let you and Jem off on Park Street, then drive along Beacon to the end of the Common and back around.â€

It was cold and cloudy, with just a few flakes of snow in the air. He remembered Boston Common and was kind of glad to see it again, even with the trees leafless and the grass brown and dead. There were still people there; there always were, and their winter hats and scarves looked happy, all different colors.

The car stopped on Park Street, across from the tourist trolleys that stopped every twenty minutes. Dad had taken them all on one onceâ€”one of the orange ones, with the open sides. It had been summer then.

â€œDo you have your mittens, sweetheart?â€ Mam was already out on the sidewalk, peering through the window. â€œYou stay with Uncle Joe, Mandyâ€”just for a few minutes.â€

Jem got out and stood with Mam on the sidewalk, putting on his mittens while they watched the gray Caddy pull away.

â€œClose your eyes, Jem,â€ Mam said quietly, and took his hand, squeezing it. â€œTell me if you can feel Mandy in your head.â€

â€œSure. I mean, yes. Sheâ€™s there.â€ He hadnâ€™t thought of Mandy as a little red light before the business in the tunnel with the train, but now he did. It kind of made it easier to concentrate on her.

â€œThatâ€™s good. You can open your eyes if you want to,â€ Mam said. â€œBut keep thinking about Mandy. Tell me if she gets too far away for you to feel.â€

He could feel Mandy all the way, until the Caddy pulled up next to them againâ€”though she had got a little fainter, then stronger again.

They did it again, with Uncle Joe and Mandy going all the way down to Arlington Street, on the far side of the Public Garden. He could still do it and was getting kind of cold and bored, standing there on the street.

â€œShe can hear him fine,â€ Uncle Joe reported, rolling down his window. â€œHow â€™bout you, sport? You hear your sister okay?â€

â€œYeah,â€ he said patiently. â€œI meanâ€”I can tell where she is, kind of. She doesnâ€™t talk in my head or anything like that.â€ He was glad she didnâ€™t. He wouldnâ€™t want Mandy chattering away in his head all the timeâ€”and he didnâ€™t want her listening to his thoughts, either. He frowned at her; he hadnâ€™t actually thought of that before.

â€œYou canâ€™t hear what Iâ€™m thinking, can you?â€ he demanded, shoving his face in the open window. Mandy was riding up front now and looked up at him, surprised. Sheâ€™d been sucking her thumb, he saw; it was all wet.

â€œNo,â€ she said, kind of uncertainly. He could see she was sort of scared by this. So was he, but he figured he wouldnâ€™t let herâ€”or Mamâ€”know that. â€œThatâ€™s good,â€ he said, and patted her on the head. She hated being patted on the head and swiped at him with a ferocious snarl. He stepped back out of reach and grinned at her.

â€œIf we have to do it again,â€ he said to his mother, â€œmaybe Mandy can stay with you, and Iâ€™ll go with Uncle Joe?â€

Mam glanced uncertainly at him, then at Mandy, but seemed to get what he was really saying and nodded, opening the door for Mandy to bounce out, relieved.

Uncle Joe hummed softly to himself as they turned around, went right, and headed down past the big theater and the Freemasonsâ€™ building. Jem could see Uncle Joeâ€™s knuckles showing through his skin, though, where he was clutching the wheel.

â€œYou nervous, sport?â€ Uncle Joe said, as they passed the Frog Pond. It was drained for the winter; it looked sort of sad.

â€œUh-huh.â€ Jem swallowed. â€œAre you?â€

Uncle Joe glanced at him, kind of startled, then smiled as he turned back to keep his eyes on the road.

â€œYeah,â€ he said softly. â€œBut I think itâ€™s gonna be okay. Youâ€™ll take good care of your mom and Mandy, and youâ€™ll find your dad. Youâ€™ll be together again.â€



â€œYeah,â€ Jem said, and swallowed again.

They drove in silence for a little bit, and the snow made little scratchy noises on the windshield, like salt being shaken on the glass.

â€œMam and Mandy are gonna be pretty cold,â€ Jem ventured.

â€œYeah, thisâ€™ll be our last try today,â€ Uncle Joe assured him. â€œStill got her? Mandy?â€

He hadnâ€™t been paying attention; heâ€™d been thinking about the stone circles. And the thing in the tunnel. And Daddy. His stomach hurt.

â€œNo,â€ he said blankly. â€œNo! I canâ€™t feel her!â€ The idea suddenly panicked him and he stiffened in his seat, pushing back with his feet. â€œDrive back!â€

â€œRight away, pal,â€ Uncle Joe said, and made a U-turn right in the middle of the street. â€œGloucester Street. Can you remember that name? We need to tell your mom, so she can work out the distance.â€

â€œUh-huh,â€ Jem said, but he wasnâ€™t really listening to Uncle Joe. He was listening hard for Mandy. Heâ€™d never thought about it at all before this, never paid any attention to whether he could sense her or not. But now it was important, and he balled up his fists and shoved one into his middle, under his ribs, where the hurt was.

Then there she was, just as though sheâ€™d always been there, like one of his toenails or something, and he let his breath out in a gasp that made Uncle Joe look sharply at him.

â€œYou got her again?â€

Jem nodded, feeling inexpressible relief. Uncle Joe sighed and his big shoulders relaxed, too.

â€œGood,â€ he said. â€œDonâ€™t let go.â€



BRIANNA PICKED UP Esmeralda the rag doll from the floor of the Abernathysâ€™ guest room and tucked her carefully in next to Mandy. Four miles. Theyâ€™d spent the morning driving round Boston in circles, and now they knew roughly how far the kidsâ€™ mutual radar went. Jem could sense Mandy at a little over a mile, but she could sense him at nearly four. Jem could sense Brianna, too, but only vaguely and only for a short distance; Mandy could sense her mother almost as far as she could detect Jem.

She should write that down in the guide, she thought, but sheâ€™d spent the afternoon in frenzied arrangements, and right now the effort of finding a pencil felt like searching for the source of the Nile or climbing Kilimanjaro. Tomorrow.

The thought of tomorrow jolted her out of her exhausted torpor with a zap of adrenaline. Tomorrow, it would start.

Theyâ€™d talked, after the kids had gone to bed. She and Joe, with Gail listening in the corner, the whites of her eyes showing now and then, but saying not a word.

â€œIt has to be Scotland,â€ sheâ€™d explained. â€œItâ€™s December; ships canâ€™t sail until the springtime. If we crossed in North Carolina, we couldnâ€™t travel from the colonies before April and wouldnâ€™t get to Scotland before the summer. And putting aside the fact that I know what ocean travel in the eighteenth century is like and I wouldnâ€™t do that with children unless the alternative was being shot . . . I canâ€™t wait that long.â€

Sheâ€™d taken a gulp of wine and swallowed, but the knot in her throat didnâ€™t go down, any more than it had with the last half-dozen swallows. Anything could happen to him in six months. Anything. â€œIâ€”have to find him.â€

The Abernathys glanced at each other, and Gailâ€™s hand touched Joe gently on the knee.

â€œOf course you do,â€ she said. â€œYou sure about Scotland, though? What about the people that tried to take Jem from you? Wonâ€™t they be waiting, if you go back?â€

Bree laughedâ€”shakily, but a laugh.

â€œAnother reason to go right away,â€ she said. â€œIn the eighteenth century, I can stop looking over my shoulder.â€

â€œYou havenâ€™t seen anybodyâ€”â€ Joe started, frowning, but she shook her head.

â€œNot in California. And not here. But I keep watching.â€ Sheâ€™d taken a few other precautions, too, things sheâ€™d recalled from her fatherâ€™s briefâ€”and discreetâ€”memoir of his World War II experiences, but no need to go into those.

â€œAnd you have some idea how to keep the kids safe in Scotland?â€ Gail was perched uneasily on the edge of her seat, as though wanting to spring up and go check on the kids. Brianna knew the feeling.

She sighed and wiped a straggle of hair out of her eye.

â€œThere are two peopleâ€”well, threeâ€”there that I think I can trust.â€

â€œYou think,â€ Joe echoed, sounding skeptical.

â€œThe only people I know I can trust are right here,â€ she said simply, and lifted her wineglass to them. Joe looked away and cleared his throat. Then he glanced at Gail, who nodded at him.

â€œWeâ€™ll go with you,â€ he said firmly, turning back to Bree. â€œGail can mind the kids, and I can make sure nobody bothers you â€™til youâ€™re set to go.â€

She bit her lip to quell the rising tears.

â€œNo,â€ she said, then cleared her own throat hard, to kill the quaver in her voiceâ€”caused as much by the vision of the two Drs. Abernathy strolling the streets of Inverness as by gratitude. It wasnâ€™t that there were no black people in the Highlands of Scotland, but they were sufficiently infrequent as to cause notice.

â€œNo,â€ she repeated, and took a deep breath. â€œWeâ€™ll go to Edinburgh to start; I can get the things we need there, without attracting attention. We wonâ€™t go up to the Highlands until everything is readyâ€”and Iâ€™ll only get in touch with my friends there at the last minute. There wonâ€™t be time for anyone else to realize weâ€™re there, before weâ€”before we go . . . through.â€

That one word, â€œthrough,â€ hit her like a blow in the chest, freighted as it was with memory of the howling void that lay between now and then. Between herself and the kidsâ€”and Roger.

The Abernathys hadnâ€™t given up easilyâ€”or altogether; she was sure there would be another attempt at breakfastâ€”but she had faith in her own stubbornness and, pleading exhaustion, had escaped from their kind worries in order to be alone with her own.



She was exhausted. But the bed sheâ€™d share with Mandy didnâ€™t draw her. She needed just to be alone for a bit, to decompress before sleep would come. She could hear going-to-bed noises on the floor below; taking off her shoes, she padded silently down to the first floor, where a light had been left on in the kitchen and another at the end of the hallway by the den, where Jem had been put to bed on the big couch.

She turned to go and check on him, but her attention was diverted by a familiar metallic chunk! The kitchen had a pocket door, slid half across. She stepped up to it and glanced through the opening, to discover Jem standing on a chair next to the counter, reaching to pull a Pop-Tart out of the toaster.

He looked up, wide-eyed at the sound of her step, held the hot pastry for a second too long, and dropped it as it burned his fingers.

â€œIfrinn!â€

â€œDonâ€™t say that,â€ she told him, coming to retrieve the fallen tart. â€œWeâ€™re about to go where people would understand it. Hereâ€”do you want some milk with that?â€

He hesitated for an instant, surprised, then hopped down like a towhee, both feet together, and landed with a light thud on the tiled floor. â€œIâ€™ll get it. You want some, too?â€ Suddenly, nothing on earth sounded better than a hot blueberry Pop-Tart with melting white icing and a glass of cold milk. She nodded and broke the hot tart in two, putting each half on a paper towel.

â€œCouldnâ€™t sleep?â€ she finally said, after theyâ€™d eaten their snack in companionable silence. He shook his head, red hair ruffled up in porcupine spikes.

â€œWant me to read you a story?â€ She didnâ€™t know what made her say that; he was much too old to be read to, though he was always somewhere nearby when she read to Mandy. He gave her a jaundiced look, but then, surprisingly, nodded and scampered up to the third floor, coming back with the new copy of Animal Nursery Tales in hand.

He didnâ€™t want to lie down right away but sat very close to her on the sofa while she read, her arm round his shoulders and his weight growing warm and heavy against her side as his breathing slowed.

â€œMy dad used to read to me if I woke up and couldnâ€™t go back to sleep,â€ she said softly, turning the last page. â€œGrandpa Frank, I mean. It was a lot like this; everything quiet.â€ And themselves cozy and bonelessly content, alone together in a puddle of warm yellow light, with the night far away.

She felt Jemâ€™s sleepy interest rise.

â€œWas he like Grandda? Grandpa Frank?â€ Sheâ€™d told the kids little things about Frank Randall, not wanting him to be forgotten, but she knew heâ€™d never be much more than a faint ghost beside the vivid warmth of their other grandfatherâ€”the grandfather they might have back. She felt a sudden small tearing in her heart, a vivid second of understanding for her mother.

Oh, Mama . . .

â€œHe was different,â€ she said softly, her mouth brushing his bright hair. â€œHe was a soldier, thoughâ€”they had that in common. And he was a writer, a scholarâ€”like Daddy. All of them wereâ€”areâ€”alike, though: theyâ€™d all take care of people. Itâ€™s what a good man does.â€

â€œOh.â€ She could feel him falling asleep, struggling to keep a hold on consciousness, the dreams beginning to walk through his waking thoughts. She eased him down into the nest of blankets and covered him, smoothing the cowlick on the crest of his head.

â€œCould we see him?â€ Jem said suddenly, his voice drowsy and soft.

â€œDaddy? Yes, weâ€™ll see him,â€ she promised, making her own voice solid with confidence.

â€œNo, your daddy . . .â€ he said, his eyes half open, glazed with sleep. â€œIf we go through the stones, could we see Grandpa Frank?â€

Her mouth dropped open, but she still hadnâ€™t found an answer when she heard him start to snore.





BE THOSE THY BEASTS?

WHILE IT WAS undeniably true that standing stones didnâ€™t bite, Roger thought, that didnâ€™t mean they werenâ€™t dangerous.

It had taken them only a day and a half to find the stone circle. Heâ€™d made a quick sketch of standing stones on the back of his hand with a bit of charcoal, to assist communication, and it had worked surprisingly well. While the scattered people theyâ€™d found had regarded them with immense curiosityâ€”and not a few private glances accompanied by whirling motions of the forefinger beside the headâ€”no one had found the visitors more than odd, and everyone had known where the stones were.

Theyâ€™d come across a tiny village, in factâ€”consisting of a church, a public house, a smithy, and several housesâ€”where the last household theyâ€™d approached had even sent one of their younger sons along to guide Buck and Roger to their goal.

And there they were now: a scatter of stumpy, lichened, wind-scored pillars beside a shallow lake filled with reeds. Ageless, harmless, part of the landscapeâ€”and the sight of them filled Roger with a fear that shivered as coldly over his skin as though he stood there naked to the wind.

â€œCan ye hear them?â€ Buck muttered under his breath, his own eyes fixed on the stones.

â€œNo,â€ Roger muttered back. â€œCan you?â€

â€œI hope not.â€ But Buck shuddered suddenly, as though something had walked across his grave.

â€œBe those thy be-asts?â€ the boy asked, grinning at Roger. He pointed at the stones, explainingâ€”Roger thoughtâ€”the local legend that the stones were in fact faery cattle, frozen in place when their drover had too much drink betaken and fell into the lake.

â€œSooth,â€ the boy assured them solemnly, making a cross over his heart. â€œMester Hacffurthe found es whip!â€

â€œWhen?â€ Buck asked sharply. â€œAnd where liveth Mester Hacffurthe?â€

A week ago, maybe twa, said the boy, waving a hand to indicate that the date was not important. And he would take them to Mester Hacffurthe, if they liked to see the thing.

Despite his name, Mester Hacffurthe proved to be a slight, light-haired young man, the village cobbler. He spoke the same impenetrable Northumbrian dialect, but with some effort and the helpful intervention of the boyâ€”whose name, he said, was Ridleyâ€”their desire was made clear, and Hacffurthe obligingly fetched the faery whip out from under his counter, laying it gingerly before them.

â€œOh, Lord,â€ Roger said at sight of itâ€”and, with a raised brow at Hacffurthe to ask permission, touched the strip carefully. A machine-woven, tight-warped strip some three inches wide and two feet long, its taut surface gleaming even in the dim light of the cobblerâ€™s shop. Part of the harness of an RAF flier. They had the right stones, then.

Careful questioning of Mr. Hacffurthe, though, elicited nothing else helpful. He had found the faery lash lying in the shallows of the lake, washing to and fro among the reeds, but had seen nothing else of note.

Roger noticed, though, that Ridley twitched slightly when Mr. Hacffurthe said this. And after they had left the cobblerâ€™s house, he paused at the edge of the village, hand in his pocket.

â€œI thank â€™ee, Master Ridley,â€ he said, and pulled out a broad tuppenny piece that made the boyâ€™s face light up. Roger put it into Ridleyâ€™s hand, but, when the boy would have turned to go, laid his own hand on the ladâ€™s arm.

â€œOne thing more, Master Ridley,â€ he said, and, with a glance at Buck, drew out the identity disks.

Ridley jerked in Rogerâ€™s grasp, his round face going pale. Buck made a small sound of satisfaction and took Ridley by his other arm.

â€œTell us about the man,â€ Buck suggested pleasantly. â€œAnd I might not break thy neck.â€

Roger shot Buck a glance of annoyance, but the threat was effective. Ridley gulped as though heâ€™d swallowed a mushroom whole, but then began to talk. Between Ridleyâ€™s dialect and his distress, the tale took some time to piece together, but at last Roger was fairly sure they had the gist of it.

â€œLet him go,â€ he said, letting go of Ridley himself. He groped in his pocket and came out with another copper penny, which he offered to the boy. Ridleyâ€™s face flexed between fear and outrage, but after a momentâ€™s hesitation, he snatched the penny and made off, glancing over his shoulder as he ran.

â€œHeâ€™ll tell his family,â€ Buck observed. â€œWeâ€™d best hurry.â€

â€œWe had. But not on that accountâ€”itâ€™s getting dark.â€ The sun was very low, a brilliant band of yellow light showing at the foot of a cold ochre sky. â€œCome on. We need to take the direction while we can.â€

So far as Roger had been able to follow Ridleyâ€™s story, the strangely dressed man (some said he was a faerie, some thought him a northerner, though there was confusion as to whether this meant a Scot, a Norseman, or something else) had had the ill luck to show up at a farm two or three miles from the stones, where he had been set upon by the inhabitants, these being an antisocial clan called Wad.

The Wads had taken everything of apparent value off the man, beaten him, and tossed him into a ravineâ€”one of the Wads had boasted of it to a drover passing through, who had mentioned the stranger in the village.

The village had of course been interestedâ€”but not sufficiently so as to go looking for the man. When Hacffurthe the cobbler had found the peculiar strip of cloth, though, rumors had started to fly thick and fast. Excitement had reached a higher pitch this very afternoon, when one of Mester Quartonâ€™s cowmen had come into the village to have a boil lanced by Granny Racket and revealed that a stranger with incomprehensible speech had tried to steal a pie from Missus Quartonâ€™s sill and was even now held captive whilst Mester Quarton thought what best to do with him.

â€œWhat might he do?â€ Roger had asked. Ridley had pushed out his lips portentously and shaken his head.

â€œMight kill â€™un,â€ he said. â€œMight take â€™unâ€™s hand off. Mester Quarton donâ€™t hold with thievinâ€™.â€

And thatâ€”aside from a vague direction regarding the location of the Quarton farmâ€”was that.

â€œThis side of the wall, two miles west and a little south, below a ridge and along the stream,â€ Roger said grimly, lengthening his stride. â€œIf we can find the stream before full dark . . .â€

â€œAye.â€ Buck fell in beside him as they turned toward where theyâ€™d left the horses. â€œSuppose Quarton keeps a dog?â€

â€œEverybody here keeps a dog.â€

â€œOh, God.â€





JUST ONE CHANCE

THERE WAS NO MOON. Undeniably a good thing, but it had its drawbacks. The farmhouse and its outbuildings lay in a pocket of darkness so profound that they mightnâ€™t have known it was there, had they not seen it before the light was quite gone. Theyâ€™d waited, though, for full dark and the dousing of the dim candlelight inside the house, and then an extra half hour or so to ensure that the inhabitantsâ€”and their dogsâ€”were well asleep.

Roger was carrying the dark lantern, but with the slide still closed; Buck ran into something lying on the ground, let out a startled cry, and fell headlong over it. The something proved to be a large sleeping goose, which let out a startled whonk! somewhat louder than Buckâ€™s cry, and promptly set about him with beak and thrashing wings. There was a sharp, inquiring bark in the distance.

â€œHush!â€ Roger hissed, coming to his ancestorâ€™s aid. â€œYeâ€™ll wake the dead, let alone them in the house.â€ He dropped his cloak over the goose, which shut up and began waddling around in confusion, a mobile heap of dark cloth. Roger clapped a hand to his mouth, but couldnâ€™t help snorting through his nose.

â€œAye, right,â€ Buck whispered, getting to his feet. â€œIf ye think Iâ€™m getting your cloak back for ye, think again.â€

â€œHeâ€™ll get out of it soon enough,â€ Roger whispered back. â€œHeâ€™s no need of it. Meanwhile, where the devil dâ€™ye think theyâ€™ve got him?â€

â€œSomeplace thatâ€™s got a door ye can bolt.â€ Buck rubbed his palms together, brushing off the dirt. â€œTheyâ€™d no keep him in the house, though, would they? Itâ€™s no that big.â€

It wasnâ€™t. You could have fitted about sixteen farmhouses that size into Lallybroch, Roger thought, and felt a sudden sharp pang, thinking of Lallybroch as it was when he hadâ€”he wouldâ€”own it.

Buck was right, though: there couldnâ€™t be more than two rooms and a loft, maybe, for the kids. And given that the neighbors thought Jerryâ€”if it was Jerryâ€”was a foreigner at best, a thief and/or supernatural being at worst, it wasnâ€™t likely that the Quartons would be keeping him in the house.

â€œDid ye see a barn, before the light went?â€ Buck whispered, changing to Gaelic. He had risen onto his toes, as though that might help him see above the tide of darkness, and was peering into the murk. Dark-adapted as Rogerâ€™s eyes now were, he could at least make out the squat shapes of the small farm buildings. Corncrib, goat shed, chicken coop, the tousled shape of a hayrick . . .

â€œNo,â€ Roger replied in the same tongue. The goose had extricated itself and gone off making disgruntled small honks; Roger bent and retrieved his cloak. â€œSmall place; they likely havenâ€™t more than an ox or a mule for the plowing, if that. I smell stock, though . . . manure, ken?â€

â€œKine,â€ Buck said, heading abruptly off toward a square-built stone structure. â€œThe cow byre. Thatâ€™ll have a bar to the door.â€

It did. And the bar was in its brackets.

â€œI donâ€™t hear any kine inside,â€ Buck whispered, drawing close. â€œAnd the smellâ€™s old.â€

It was near-on winter. Maybe theyâ€™d had to slaughter the cowâ€”or cows; maybe theyâ€™d driven them to market. But, cow or no, there was something inside; he heard a shuffling noise and what might have been a muffled curse.

â€œAye, well, thereâ€™s something inside.â€ Roger raised the dark lantern, groping for the slide. â€œGet the bar, will you?â€



But before Buck could reach for the bar, a shout of â€œHoy!â€ came from inside, and something fell heavily against the door. â€œHelp! Help me! Help!â€

The voice spoke English, and Buck changed back at once. â€œWill ye for Godâ€™s sake hush your noise?â€ he said to the man inside, annoyed. â€œYe want to have them all down on us? Here, then, bring the light closer,â€ he said to Roger, and drew the bar with a small grunt of effort.

The door swung open as Buck set down the bar, and light shot out of the lanternâ€™s open slide. A slightly built young man with flyaway fair hairâ€”the same color as Buckâ€™s, Roger thoughtâ€”blinked at them, dazzled by the light, then closed his eyes against it.

Roger and Buck glanced at each other for an instant, then, with one accord, stepped into the byre.

He is, Roger thought. Itâ€™s him. I know itâ€™s him. God, heâ€™s so young! Barely more than a boy. Oddly, he felt no burst of dizzying excitement. It was a feeling of calm certainty, as though the world had suddenly righted itself and everything had fallen into place. He reached out and touched the man gently on the shoulder.

â€œWhatâ€™s your name, mate?â€ he said softly, in English.

â€œMacKenzie, J. W.,â€ the young man said, shoulders straightening as he drew himself up, sharp chin jutting. â€œLieutenant, Royal Air Force. Service Numberâ€”â€ He broke off, staring at Roger, who belatedly realized that, calmness or no, he was grinning from ear to ear. â€œWhatâ€™s funny?â€ Jerry MacKenzie demanded, belligerent.

â€œNothing,â€ Roger assured him. â€œEr . . . gladâ€”glad to see you, thatâ€™s all.â€ His throat was tight, and he had to cough. â€œHave ye been here long?â€

â€œNo, just a few hours. Ye wouldnâ€™t have any food on ye, I donâ€™t suppose?â€ He looked hopefully from one man to the other.

â€œWe do,â€ Buck said, â€œbut this isna the time to stop for a bite, aye?â€ He glanced over his shoulder. â€œLetâ€™s be off.â€

â€œAye. Aye, we should.â€ But Roger spoke automatically, unable to stop looking at J. W. MacKenzie, RAF, aged twenty-two.

â€œWho are you?â€ Jerry asked, staring back. â€œWhere dâ€™ye come from? God knows yeâ€™re not from here!â€

Roger exchanged a quick look with Buck. They hadnâ€™t planned what to say; Roger hadnâ€™t been willing to jinx the enterprise by thinking that theyâ€™d really find Jerry MacKenzie, and as for Buckâ€”

â€œInverness,â€ Buck said abruptly. He sounded gruff.

Jerryâ€™s eyes flicked back and forth between them, and he caught Rogerâ€™s sleeve.

â€œYe know what I mean!â€ he said, and gulped air, bracing himself. â€œWhen?â€

Roger touched Jerryâ€™s hand, cold and dirty, the fingers long like his own. The question caught at his throat and thickened his voice too much to speak.

â€œA lang way from you,â€ Buck said quietly, and for the first time, Roger caught a note of desolation in his voice. â€œFrom now. Lost.â€

That struck him to the heart. Heâ€™d truly forgotten their situation for a little, driven by the urgency of finding this man. But Buckâ€™s answer made Jerryâ€™s face, already drawn with hunger and strain, go white under the dirt.

â€œJesus,â€ Jerry whispered. â€œWhere are we now? Andâ€”and when?â€



Buck stiffened. Not at Jerryâ€™s question, but at a noise from outside. Roger didnâ€™t know what had made it, but it wasnâ€™t the wind. Buck made a low, urgent noise in his throat, shifting.

â€œI think itâ€™s part of Northumbria now,â€ Roger said. â€œLook, thereâ€™s no time. We have to go, before someone hearsâ€”â€

â€œAye, right. Letâ€™s go, then.â€ Jerry had a filthy silk scarf round his neck; he tugged the ends straight and shoved them into his shirt.

The air outside was wonderful after the smells of the cow byre, fresh with new-turned earth and dying heather. They made their way as quickly as they could through the yard, skirting the farmhouse. Jerry was lame, he saw, limping badly, and Roger took his arm to help. A shrill yap came from the darkness, some distance awayâ€”then another bark, in a deeper tone.

Roger hastily licked a finger and held it up to gauge the direction of the breeze. A dog barked again, and another echoed it.

â€œThis way,â€ he whispered to his companions, tugging Jerryâ€™s arm. He led them away from the house as fast as possible, trying to keep his bearings, and they found themselves stumbling through a plowed field, dirt clods crumbling under their boots.

Buck stumbled and swore under his breath. They lurched from furrow to ridge, half-legged and clumsy, Roger clinging to Jerryâ€™s arm to keep him upright; one of Jerryâ€™s legs seemed gammy and wouldnâ€™t take his weight. Heâ€™s been wounded. I saw the medal. . . .

Then the dogs began to bark, voices suddenly clearâ€”and much closer.

â€œJesus.â€ Roger stopped for an instant, breathing hard. Where the bloody hell was the wood theyâ€™d hidden in? Heâ€™d swear theyâ€™d been heading for it, butâ€”the beam from the lantern swung crazily, showing meaningless patches of field. He shut the slide; theyâ€™d be better off without it.

â€œThis way!â€ Buck lurched away and Roger and Jerry followed perforce, hearts thumping. Christ, it sounded like a half-dozen dogs at least had been let loose, all barking. And was that a voice, calling to the dogs? Yes, it bloody was. He couldnâ€™t understand a word, but the meaning was as clear as ice water.

They ran, stumbling and panting. Roger couldnâ€™t tell where they were; he was following Buck. He dropped the lantern at one point; it fell over with a clank and he heard the oil inside gurgle out of its reservoir. With a soft whoosh, it flowered into brilliant flame.

â€œShit!â€ They ran. It didnâ€™t matter where, what direction. Just away from the burning beacon and the irate voicesâ€”more than one now.

Suddenly they were into a scrim of treesâ€”the low, wind-crabbed grove theyâ€™d lurked in earlier. But the dogs were on their track, barking eagerly, and they didnâ€™t linger but fought their way through the brush and out again, up a steep hill turfed with heather. Rogerâ€™s foot sank through the spongy growth into a puddle, soaking him to the ankle, and he nearly lost his balance. Jerry set his feet and yanked Roger upright, then lost his own balance when his knee gave way; they clung together, wobbling precariously for an instant, then Roger lurched forward again and they were out of it.

He thought his lungs would burst, but they kept goingâ€”not running any longer; you couldnâ€™t run up a hill like thisâ€”slogging, planting one foot after another, after another . . . Roger began to see bursts of light at the edges of his vision; he tripped, staggered, and fell, and was hauled to his feet by Jerry.

They were all three half sopping and smeared head to foot with mud and heather scratchings when they lurched at last to the crest of the hill and stopped for a moment, swaying and gasping for air.

â€œWhere . . . are we going?â€ Jerry wheezed, using the end of his scarf to wipe his face.

Roger shook his head, still short of breathâ€”but then caught the faint gleam of water.

â€œWeâ€™re taking you . . . back. To the stones by the lake. Where . . . you came through. Come on!â€

They pelted down the far side of the hill, headlong, almost falling, now exhilarated by the speed and the thought of a goal.

â€œHow . . . did you find me?â€ Jerry gasped, when at last they hit bottom and stopped for breath.

â€œFound your tags,â€ Buck said, almost brusque. â€œFollowed their trail back.â€

Roger put a hand to his pocket, about to offer them backâ€”but didnâ€™t. It had struck him, like a stone to the middle of his chest, that, having found Jerry MacKenzie against substantial odds, he was about to part from him, likely forever. And that was only if things went well. . . .

His father. Dad? He couldnâ€™t think of this young man, white-faced and lame, nearly twenty years his junior, as his fatherâ€”not the father heâ€™d imagined all his life.

â€œCome on.â€ Buck took Jerryâ€™s arm now, nearly holding him up, and they began to forge their way across the dark fields, losing their way and finding it again, guided by the light of Orion overhead.

Orion, Lepus. Canis major. He found a measure of comfort in the stars, blazing in the cold black sky. Those didnâ€™t change; theyâ€™d shine foreverâ€”or as close as made no differenceâ€”on him and on this man, no matter where each one might end up.

End up. The cold air burned in his lungs. Bree . . .

And then he could see them: squatty pillars, no more than blotches on the night, visible only because they showed dark and immobile against the sheet of moving water stirred by the wind.

â€œRight,â€ he said hoarsely, and, swallowing, wiped his face on his sleeve. â€œThis is where we leave you.â€

â€œYe do?â€ Jerry panted. â€œButâ€”but youâ€”â€

â€œWhen ye came . . . through. Did ye have anything on you? A gemstone, any jewelry?â€

â€œAye,â€ Jerry said, bewildered. â€œI had a raw sapphire in my pocket. But itâ€™s gone. Itâ€™s like itâ€”â€

â€œLike it burnt up,â€ Buck finished for him, grim-voiced. â€œAye. Well, so?â€ This last was clearly addressed to Roger, who hesitated. Bree . . . No more than an instant, thoughâ€”he stuck a hand into the leather pouch at his waist, pulled out the tiny oilcloth package, fumbled it open, and pressed the garnet pendant into Jerryâ€™s hand. It was faintly warm from his body, and Jerryâ€™s cold hand closed over it in reflex.



â€œTake this; itâ€™s a good one. When ye go through,â€ Roger said, and leaned toward him, trying to impress him with the importance of his instructions, â€œthink about your wife, about Marjorie. Think hard; see her in your mindâ€™s eye, and walk straight through. Whatever the hell ye do, though, donâ€™t think about your son. Just your wife.â€

â€œWhat?â€ Jerry was gobsmacked. â€œHow the bloody hell do you know my wifeâ€™s name? And whereâ€™ve ye heard about my son?â€

â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter,â€ Roger said, and turned his head to look back over his shoulder.

â€œDamn,â€ said Buck softly. â€œTheyâ€™re still coming. Thereâ€™s a light.â€

There was: a single light, bobbing evenly over the ground, as it would if someone carried it. But look as he might, Roger could see no one behind it, and a violent shiver ran over him.

â€œThaibhse,â€ said Buck, under his breath. Roger knew that word well enoughâ€”spirit, it meant. And usually an ill-disposed one. A haunt.

â€œAye, maybe.â€ He was beginning to catch his breath. â€œAnd maybe not.â€ He turned again to Jerry. â€œEither way, ye need to go, man, and now. Remember, think of your wife.â€

Jerry swallowed, his hand closing tight around the stone.

â€œAye. Aye . . . right. Thanks, then,â€ he added awkwardly.

Roger couldnâ€™t speak, could give him nothing more than the breath of a smile. Then Buck was beside him, plucking urgently at his sleeve and gesturing at the bobbing light, and they set off, awkward and lumbering after the brief cooldown.

Bree . . . He swallowed, fists clenched. Heâ€™d got a stone once, he could do it again. . . . But the greater part of his mind was still with the man they had just left by the lake. He looked over his shoulder and saw Jerry beginning to walk, limping badly but resolute, thin shoulders squared under his pale khaki shirt and the end of his scarf fluttering in the rising wind.

Then it all rose up in him. Seized by an urgency greater than any heâ€™d ever known, he turned and ran. Ran heedless of footing, of dark, of Buckâ€™s startled cry behind him.

Jerry heard his footsteps on the grass and whirled round, startled himself. Roger grabbed him by both hands, squeezed them hard enough to make Jerry gasp, and said fiercely, â€œI love you!â€

That was all there was time forâ€”and all he could possibly say. He let go and turned away fast, his boots making a shoof-shoof noise in the dry lake grass. He glanced up the hill, but the light had vanished. Likely it had been someone from the farmhouse, satisfied now that the intruders were gone.

Buck was waiting, shrouded in his cloak and holding Rogerâ€™s; he must have dropped it coming down the hill. Buck shook it out and folded it round Rogerâ€™s shoulders; Rogerâ€™s fingers shook, trying to fasten the brooch.

â€œWhy did ye tell him a daft thing like that?â€ Buck asked, doing it for him. Buckâ€™s head was bent, not looking at him.

Roger swallowed hard, and his voice came clear but painful, the words like ice shards in his throat.

â€œBecause he isnâ€™t going to make it back. Itâ€™s the only chance Iâ€™ll ever have. Come on.â€





POSTPARTUM

THE NIGHT SHIVERED. The whole night. The ground and the lake, the sky, the dark, the stars, and every particle of his own body. He was scattered, instantly everywhere and part of everything. And part of them. There was one moment of an exaltation too great for fear and then he vanished, his last thought no more than a faint, I am . . . voiced more in hope than declaration.

Roger came back to a blurred knowledge of himself, flat on his back under a clear black sky whose brilliant stars seemed pinpoints now, desperately far away. He missed them, missed being part of the night. Missed, with a brief rending sense of desolation, the two men whoâ€™d shared his soul for that blazing moment.

The sound of Buck throwing up returned him to a sense of his body. He was lying in cold, wet grass, half soaked, smelling of mud and old manure, chilled to the bone, and bruised in a number of uncomfortable places.

Buck said something horrible in Gaelic and retched again. He was on his hands and knees a few feet away, a blot on the darkness.

â€œYou all right?â€ Roger croaked, rolling onto his side. Heâ€™d remembered, suddenly, the trouble with Buckâ€™s heart when theyâ€™d made their passage at Craigh na Dun. â€œIf your heartâ€™s giving you bother againâ€”â€

â€œIf it was, damn-all ye could do about it, is there?â€ Buck said. He hawked a glob of something nasty into the grass and sat down heavily, wiping his sleeve across his mouth. â€œChrist, I hate that! Didna ken weâ€™d feel it, this far away.â€

â€œMmphm.â€ Roger sat up slowly. He wondered whether Buck had felt the same thing he had, but it didnâ€™t seem the moment for metaphysical discussion. â€œHeâ€™s gone, then.â€

â€œWant me to go and make sure of it?â€ Buck said disagreeably. â€œGod, my head!â€

Roger rose to his feet, staggering a little, and went and got Buck under one arm, levering him to his feet.

â€œCome on,â€ he said. â€œLetâ€™s go find the horses. Weâ€™ll get away a bit, make a wee camp, get some food into you.â€

â€œIâ€™m not hungry.â€

â€œI bloody am.â€ In fact, he was ravenous. Buck swayed but appeared able to stand on his own. Roger released him and turned briefly to look back at the distant lake and the standing stones. For an instant, he recaptured the sense of being part of them, and then it was gone; the gleaming water and the stones were no more than part of the craggy landscape.



There was no way of knowing what time it was, but the night was still pitch-dark by the time theyâ€™d retrieved the horses, made their way to a sheltered spot under a cliff face, found water, made fire, and toasted some bannocks to eat with their dried salt herring.

They didnâ€™t talk, both exhausted. Roger pushed away the obvious â€œSo now what?â€ and let his thoughts come randomly as they would; time enough for plans tomorrow.

After a bit, Buck got up abruptly and went off into the dark. He stayed gone for some time, during which time Roger sat gazing into the fire, replaying every moment heâ€™d spent with Jerry MacKenzie in his mind, trying to fix it all. He wished passionately that it had been daylight, that heâ€™d been able to see more of his fatherâ€™s face than the brief glimpses heâ€™d had in the beam of the dark lantern.

Whatever his regrets, though, and the cold knowledge that Jerry wouldnâ€™t make it backâ€”or not back to where heâ€™d started from, at least (God, what if he ended up lost in yet another strange time? Was that possible?)â€”there was the one small, warm thing. Heâ€™d said it. And wherever his father had gone, heâ€™d carry that with him.

He wrapped himself in his cloak, lay down by the embers of the fire, and carried it with him into sleep.



WHEN ROGER WOKE in the morning, thickheaded but feeling reasonably okay, Buck had already built up the fire and was frying bacon. The smell of it got Roger into a sitting position, rubbing the last of the sleep from his eyes.

Buck blotted a slice of thick bacon out of the pan with a bannock and handed it to him. He seemed to have recovered from the aftereffects of Jerryâ€™s leaving; he was disheveled and unshaven, but clear-eyed, and gave Roger an assessing look.

â€œAre ye in one piece?â€ It wasnâ€™t asked as a rhetorical question, and Roger nodded, taking the food. He started to say something in reply, but his throat was constricted, and nothing much came out. He cleared his throat hard, but Buck shook his head, indicating that no effort need be made on his part.

â€œIâ€™m thinking weâ€™ll head north again,â€ Buck said, without preamble. â€œYeâ€™ll want to keep looking for your lad, I supposeâ€”and I want to go to Cranesmuir.â€

So did Roger, though likely for other reasons. He eyed Buck closely, but his ancestor avoided his eye.

â€œGeillis Duncan?â€

â€œWouldnâ€™t you?â€ Buckâ€™s tone was belligerent.

â€œI just did,â€ Roger said dryly. â€œAye, of course ye do.â€ This didnâ€™t come as a surprise. He chewed his makeshift butty slowly, wondering just how much to tell Buck about Geillis. â€œYour mother,â€ he began, and cleared his throat again.

When Roger had finished, Buck sat in silence for some time, blinking at the last slice of bacon, drying in the pan.

â€œJesus,â€ he said, but not in tones of shock. More a deep interest, Roger thought, with some unease. Buck glanced up at Roger, speculation in his moss-green eyes. â€œAnd what dâ€™ye ken about my father, then?â€

â€œMore than I can tell ye in a few minutes, and we should be on our way.â€ Roger got up, brushing crumbs off his knees. â€œI donâ€™t want to try explaining our presence to any of those hairy buggers. My Old English isnâ€™t what it used to be.â€

â€œâ€˜Sumer is icumen in,â€™â€ Buck said, with a glance at the leafless, wind-blasted saplings precariously rooted in the cliffâ€™s crevices. â€œ â€˜Lhude sing cuccu.â€™ Aye, letâ€™s go.â€





SOLSTICE

December 19, 1980

Edinburgh, Scotland

A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR TIME TRAVELERSâ€”PART II

Itâ€™s almost time. The winter solstice is day after tomorrow. I keep imagining that I can feel the earth shifting slowly in the dark, tectonic plates moving under my feet and . . . things . . . invisibly lining up. The moon is waxing, nearly a quarter full. Have no idea whether that might be important.

In the morning, weâ€™ll take the train to Inverness. Iâ€™ve called Fiona; sheâ€™ll meet us at the station, and weâ€™ll eat and change at her houseâ€”then sheâ€™ll drive us to Craigh na Dun . . . and leave us there. Keep wondering if I should ask her to stayâ€”or at least to come back in an hour, in case one or more of us should still be there, on fire or unconscious. Or dead.

After dithering for an hour, I called Lionel Menzies, too, and asked him to keep an eye on Rob Cameron. Inverness is a small town; thereâ€™s always the chance that someone will see us coming off the train, or at Fionaâ€™s. And word spreads fast. If anythingâ€™s going to happen, I want warning.

I have these brief lucid moments when everything seems okay and Iâ€™m filled with hope, almost trembling with anticipation. Most of the time, I keep thinking Iâ€™m insane, and then Iâ€™m really shaking.





THE SUCCUBUS OF CRANESMUIR

Cranesmuir, Scotland

ROGER AND BUCK stood at the far side of the tiny square in the middle of Cranesmuir, looking up at the fiscalâ€™s house. Roger cast a bleak look at the plinth in the middle of the square, with its wooden pillory. At least there were holes for only one miscreant; no crime waves in Cranesmuir.

â€œThe attic, ye said?â€ Buck was staring intently at the windows of the top story. It was a substantial house, with leaded windows, and even the attic had some, though smaller than the ones in the lower stories. â€œI can see plants hanging from the ceiling, I think.â€

â€œThatâ€™s what Claire said, aye. That she keeps her . . . herâ€â€”the word â€œlairâ€ came to mind, but he discarded this in favor ofâ€”â€œher surgery up there. Where she makes up her potions and charms.â€ He inspected his cuffs, which were still damp after a hasty sponge bath at the village horse trough to remove the worst stains of travel, and checked to see that his hair ribbon was in order.

The door opened and a man came outâ€”a merchant, maybe, or a lawyer, well dressed, with a warm coat against the mizzle. Buck shifted to one side, peering to get a look before the door closed behind him.

â€œThereâ€™s a servant at the door,â€ he reported. â€œIâ€™ll knock, then, and ask if I can seeâ€”Mrs. Duncan, is that her name?â€

â€œFor the moment, aye,â€ Roger said. He sympathized entirely with Buckâ€™s need to see his mother. And in all truth, he was curious to meet the woman himself; she was his five-times great-grandmotherâ€”and one of the few time travelers he knew about. But heâ€™d also heard enough about her that his feelings were of excitement mixed with considerable unease.

He coughed, fist to his mouth. â€œDâ€™ye want me to come up with you? If sheâ€™s to home, I mean.â€

Buck opened his mouth to reply, then closed it, considered a moment, then nodded.

â€œAye, I do,â€ he said quietly. He shot Roger a sidelong look, though, with a gleam of humor in it. â€œYe can help keep the conversation going.â€

â€œHappy to help,â€ Roger said. â€œWeâ€™re agreed, though: ye dinna mean to tell her who ye are. Or what.â€

Buck nodded again, though his eyes were now fixed on the door, and Roger thought he wasnâ€™t attending.



â€œAye,â€ he said. â€œCome on, then,â€ and strode across the square, head up and shoulders squared.

â€œMrs. Duncan? Well, I dinna ken, gentlemen,â€ the maid said. â€œSheâ€™s to hame the day, but Dr. McEwanâ€™s with her just noo.â€

Rogerâ€™s heart jumped.

â€œIs she ill?â€ Buck asked sharply, and the maid blinked, surprised.

â€œOch, no. Theyâ€™re takinâ€™ tea in the parlor. Would ye like to step in oot the rain and Iâ€™ll go and see what she says?â€ She stepped back to let them in, and Roger took advantage of this to touch her arm.

â€œDr. McEwanâ€™s a friend of ours. Would ye maybe be giving him our names? Roger and William MacKenzieâ€”at his service.â€

They discreetly shook as much water as possible off their hats and coats, but within a few moments the maid was back, smiling.

â€œCome up, gentlemen, Mrs. Duncan says, and welcome! Just up the stair there. Iâ€™ll just be fetching ye a bit oâ€™ tea.â€

The parlor was one floor above, a small room, rather crowded, but warm and colorful. Neither of the men had eyes for the furnishings, though.

â€œMr. MacKenzie,â€ Dr. McEwan said, looking surprised but cordial. â€œAnd Mr. MacKenzie.â€ He shook hands with them and turned to the woman who had risen from her seat beside the fire. â€œMy dear, allow me to make you acquainted with an erstwhile patient of mine and his kinsman. Gentlemen, Mrs. Duncan.â€

Roger felt Buck stiffen slightly, and no wonder. He hoped he wasnâ€™t staring himself.

Geillis Duncan was maybe not a classic beauty, but that didnâ€™t matter. She was certainly good-looking, with creamy-blond hair put up under a lace cap, andâ€”of courseâ€”the eyes. Eyes that made him want to close his own and poke Buck in the back to make him do the same, because surely she or McEwan would notice. . . .

McEwan had noticed something, all right, but it wasnâ€™t the eyes. He was eyeing Buck with a small frown of displeasure, as Buck took a long stride forward, seized the womanâ€™s hand, and boldly kissed it.

â€œMrs. Duncan,â€ he said, straightening up and smiling right into those clear green eyes. â€œYour most humble and obedient servant, maâ€™am.â€

She smiled back, one blond brow raised, with an amused look that met Buckâ€™s implied challengeâ€”and raised it. Even from where he was standing, Roger felt the snap of attraction between them, sharp as a spark of static electricity. So had McEwan.

â€œHow is your health, Mr. MacKenzie?â€ McEwan said pointedly to Buck. He pulled a chair into place. â€œDo sit down and let me examine you.â€

Buck either didnâ€™t hear or pretended not to. He was still holding Geillis Duncanâ€™s hand, and she wasnâ€™t pulling it away.

â€œâ€™Twas kind of you to receive us, maâ€™am,â€ he said. â€œAnd certainly we donâ€™t mean to disturb your tea. Weâ€™d heard of your skill as a healer and meant to call in what you might say is a professional way.â€

â€œProfessional,â€ she repeated, and Roger was surprised at her voice. It was light, almost girlish. Then she smiled again and the illusion of girlishness vanished. She drew her hand away now, but with a languid air of reluctance, her eyes still fixed on Buck with obvious interest. â€œYour profession, or mine?â€

â€œAh, Iâ€™m naught but a humble solicitor, maâ€™am,â€ Buck said, with a gravity so patently mock that Roger wanted to punch him. Then he added, turning to Roger, â€œand my kinsman here is a scholar and musician. But as ye see, heâ€™s suffered a sad accident to his throat, andâ€”â€

Now Roger truly wanted to punch him. â€œIâ€”â€ he began, but with the cruel whim of fate, his throat chose that moment to constrict, and his protest ended in a gurgle like a rusty pipe.

â€œWeâ€™d heard of ye, mistress, as I said,â€ Buck went on, putting a sympathetic hand on Rogerâ€™s shoulder and squeezing hard. â€œAnd as I say, we wondered . . .â€

â€œLet me see,â€ she said, and came to stand in front of Roger, her face suddenly a few inches from his. Behind her, McEwan was growing red in the face.

â€œIâ€™ve seen this man,â€ he told her. â€œItâ€™s a permanent injury, though I was able to offer some small relief. Butâ€”â€

â€œPermanent, indeed.â€ Sheâ€™d undone his neckcloth in seconds and spread his shirt open, her fingers warm and light on his scar. She shifted her gaze and looked directly into his eyes. â€œBut a lucky one, Iâ€™d say. You didnâ€™t die.â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, his voice hoarse but at least serviceable again. â€œI didnâ€™t.â€ God, she was unsettling. Claire had described her vividlyâ€”but Claire was a woman. She was still touching him, and while her touch was not in any way improper, it was damned intimate.

Buck was growing restive; he didnâ€™t like her touching Roger any more than McEwan did. He cleared his throat.

â€œI wonder, mistressâ€”might ye have any simples, medicines, perhaps? Not only for my kinsman here, but . . . well . . .â€ He coughed in a way meant to indicate that he harbored more-delicate ailments that he didnâ€™t wish to mention before others.

The woman smelled of sex. Very recent sex. It rose from her like incense.

She stayed in front of Roger for a moment, still looking intently into his face, but then smiled and took her hand away, leaving his throat feeling suddenly cool and exposed.

â€œOf course,â€ she said, switching smile and attention to Buck. â€œCome up to my wee attic, sir. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ve something there that will cure what ails ye.â€

Roger felt gooseflesh ripple across his chest and shoulders, in spite of the good fire on the hearth. Buck and McEwan had both twitched slightly, and she bloody well knew it, though her face was entirely composed. Roger fixed a glare on Buck, willing his ancestor to look at him. Buck didnâ€™t but moved to take Geillisâ€™s arm, pulling her hand through his elbow. A slow, hot flush burned up the back of his neck.

McEwan made a very small noise in his throat.

Then Buck and Geillis were gone, the sound of their footsteps and animated voices dying away as they climbed the stairs to the attic, leaving Roger and McEwan both silent, each for his own reasons.





ROGER THOUGHT that the good doctor might be about to suffer an apoplexy, if that was the correct medical term for â€œblow a gasket.â€ Whatever his own feelings about the abrupt departure of Buck and Geillisâ€”and those were vividâ€”they paled beside the hue of Hector McEwanâ€™s face.

The doctor was panting slightly, his complexion puce. Plainly he wanted to follow the errant pair but just as clearly was constrained by the fact that he had no idea what he might conceivably do when he caught up with them.

â€œItâ€™s not what you think,â€ Roger said, commending his soul to God and hoping that it wasnâ€™t.

McEwan swung round to glare at him. â€œThe devil itâ€™s not,â€ he snapped. â€œYou donâ€™t know her.â€

â€œPlainly not as well as you do, no,â€ Roger said pointedly, and raised one brow.

McEwan said something blasphemous in reply, took up the poker, and stabbed viciously at the smoking bricks of peat in the hearth. He half-turned toward the door, the poker still in his hand, and the look on his face was such that Roger leapt to his feet and grabbed him by the arm.

â€œStop, man,â€ he said, keeping his voice pitched as low and evenly as he could, in hopes of soothing McEwan. â€œYeâ€™ll do yourself no good. Sit down, now. Iâ€™ll tell ye why itâ€”why heâ€”why the manâ€™s interested in her.â€

â€œFor the same reason every dog in the village is interested in a bitch in heat,â€ McEwan said venomously. But he let Roger take the poker from his hand, and while he wouldnâ€™t sit down, he did at least take several deep breaths that restored a semblance of calm.

â€œAye, tell me, thenâ€”for all the good it will do,â€ he said.

It wasnâ€™t a situation that allowed for diplomacy or euphemism.

â€œSheâ€™s his mother, and he knows it,â€ Roger said bluntly.

Whatever McEwan had been expecting, that wasnâ€™t it, and for an instant, Roger was gratified to see the manâ€™s face go absolutely blank with shock. Only for an instant, though. It was likely going to be a tricky bit of pastoral counseling, at best.

â€œYe know what he is,â€ Roger said, taking the doctor by the arm again and pulling him toward a brocaded wing chair. â€œOr, rather, what we are. Cognosco te?â€

â€œIâ€”â€ McEwanâ€™s voice died, though he opened and closed his mouth a few times, helplessly looking for words.

â€œAye, I know,â€ Roger said soothingly. â€œItâ€™s difficult. But ye do know, donâ€™t ye?â€

â€œIâ€”yes.â€ McEwan sat down abruptly. He breathed for a moment, blinked once or twice, and looked up at Roger.

â€œHis mother. His mother?â€

â€œI have it on good authority,â€ Roger assured him. A thought struck him, though.

â€œAh . . . ye did know about her, didnâ€™t ye? That sheâ€™s . . . one of us?â€

McEwan nodded. â€œSheâ€™s never admitted it. Justâ€”just laughed at me when I told her where Iâ€™d come from. And I didnâ€™t know for a long time. Not until Iâ€”â€ His lips clamped abruptly into a tight line.

â€œIâ€™m guessing ye didnâ€™t have occasion to heal her of anything,â€ Roger said carefully. â€œDoes she . . . er . . . has it got anything to do with blue light, by chance?â€

He was trying hard to avoid the mental picture of Geillis and Dr. McEwan, naked and sweating, both bathed in a faint blue glow. The woman was his several-times great-grandmother, whatever else you liked to say about her.

McEwan gave him a bleak look and shook his head.

â€œNot . . . exactly. Sheâ€™s a very fine herbalist and not bad at diagnosis, but she canâ€™tâ€”do that.â€ He twiddled his fingers briefly in illustration, and Roger felt a faint memory of the warmth when McEwan had touched his throat.

The doctor sighed and rubbed a hand over his face.

â€œNo point in evasion, I suppose. I got her with child. And I couldâ€”â€˜seeâ€™ is not quite the right word, but I canâ€™t think of a better one. I could see the moment when my . . . seed . . . reached her ovum. The . . . er . . . the fetus. It glowed inside her womb; I could sense it when I touched her.â€

A certain heat rose in Rogerâ€™s face. â€œForgive me for asking, butâ€”how do you know that happened because sheâ€™s . . . what she is? Might it not be the case with a normal woman?â€

McEwan smiledâ€”very bleaklyâ€”at the word â€œnormal,â€ and shook his head.

â€œI had two children by a woman in Edinburgh, inâ€”in my own time,â€ he said quietly, and looked down at his feet. â€œThat . . . was one of the reasons I didnâ€™t try to return.â€

Roger made a sound in his damaged throat that was meant to be regretful and compassionate, but whether his feelings or his larynx had got the better of him, it emerged as a rather stern â€œHrmph!â€ and McEwanâ€™s color began to rise again.

â€œI know,â€ he said wretchedly. â€œI donâ€™t seek toâ€”to excuse it.â€

Just as well, Roger thought. Iâ€™d like to see ye try, youâ€”youâ€” But recriminations would do no one any good just now, and he stifled whatever else he might have said on the subject, instead returning to Geillis.

â€œYe said ye got herâ€â€”jerking his chin upward, to where the sounds of footsteps and bumpings were audible overheadâ€”â€œwith child. Where is the child?â€

McEwan drew a long, trembling breath. â€œI said . . . she is a very fine herb-alist . . . ?â€

â€œJesus, Lord,â€ Roger said. â€œDid ye know she meant to do it?â€

McEwan swallowed audibly, but kept silent.

â€œMy God,â€ Roger said.

â€œMy God. I know itâ€™s not my place to judge youâ€”but if it was, man, youâ€™d burn in hell.â€

And with that, he went downstairs and out into the streets of Cranesmuir, leaving the lot of them to their own devices.



HEâ€™D MADE SIXTEEN circuits of the village squareâ€”it was a small squareâ€”before getting a precarious hold on his sense of outrage. He stood in front of the Duncansâ€™ front door, fists clenched, taking deep, deliberate breaths.



He had to go back. You didnâ€™t walk away from people who were drowning, even if theyâ€™d jumped into a quagmire on purpose. And he didnâ€™t want to think what might happen if McEwan, left to himself, should be overcome by anguish or fury and rush in on the pair in the attic. He really didnâ€™t want to think what Buckâ€”or, God forbid, Geillisâ€”might do in that case, and the thought galvanized him.

He didnâ€™t trouble knocking. Arthur Duncan was the procurator fiscal; his door was always open. The wee maid poked her head out of an inner door at the sound of his footsteps, but when she saw who he was, she drew it in again, doubtless thinking heâ€™d just stepped out for something.

He nearly sprinted up the stair, a guilty conscience now furnishing him with visions of Hector McEwan hanging from the small chandelier in the parlor, helpless feet kicking in the air.

When he burst in, though, he found McEwan slumped forward in the wing chair, face buried in his hands. He didnâ€™t look up at Rogerâ€™s entrance and wouldnâ€™t raise his head even when Roger shook him gently by the shoulder.

â€œCome on, man,â€ he said gruffly, then cleared his throat. â€œYeâ€™re still a doctor, arenâ€™t ye? Yeâ€™re needed.â€

That made the man look up, startled. His face was mottled with emotionâ€”anger, shame, desolation, lust. Could lust be an emotion? Roger wondered briefly, but dismissed the consideration as academic at the moment. McEwan straightened his shoulders and rubbed both hands hard over his face, as though trying to erase the feelings so plainly displayed there.

â€œWho needs me?â€ he said, and rose to his feet with a decent attempt at composure.

â€œI do,â€ Roger said, and cleared his throat again, with a noise like falling gravel. It felt like gravel, too; strong emotion choked him, literally. â€œCome outside, aye? I need air, and so do you.â€

McEwan cast one last look up at the ceiling, where the noises had now ceased, then firmed his lips, nodded, and, taking up his hat from the table, came along.

Roger led the way out of the square and past the last house, then up a cow path, dodging heaps of manure, until they reached a drystane wall that they could sit upon. He sat down himself and gestured to McEwan, who sat obediently. The walk had lent the doctor some semblance of calm, and he turned at once to Roger and spread open his collarâ€”this still flapping loose. Roger felt the ghost of Geillis Duncanâ€™s touch on his throat and shivered, but it was cold out, and McEwan took no notice.

The doctor wrapped his fingers loosely around the scar and seemed to listen for a moment, head to one side. Then he pulled his hand back a little and felt delicately up higher with two probing fingers, then lower, a small frown of concentration on his face.

And Roger felt it. The same odd sensation of light warmth. Heâ€™d been holding his breath under the doctorâ€™s touch, but at this realization he exhaled suddenlyâ€”and freely.

â€œJesus,â€ he said, and put his own hand to his throat. The word had come freely, too.



â€œItâ€™s better?â€ McEwan was looking at him intently, his earlier upset subsumed in professional concern.

â€œIt . . . is.â€ The scar was still bumpy under his fingers, but something had changed. He cleared his throat experimentally. A little pain, a little blockageâ€”but noticeably better. He lowered his hand and stared at McEwan. â€œThank you. What the bloody hell did you do?â€

The tension that had been twanging through McEwan since Roger and Buck had entered the Duncansâ€™ house finally eased, just as the tightness in Rogerâ€™s throat had.

â€œI donâ€™t know that I can tell you with any great precision,â€ he said apologetically. â€œItâ€™s just that I know what a sound larynx should feel like, and I can tell what yours feels like, and . . .â€ He shrugged a little, helpless. â€œI put my fingers there and . . . envision the way it should feel.â€

He touched Rogerâ€™s throat gently again, exploring. â€œI can tell that itâ€™s very slightly better now. But there is a good deal of damage. I canâ€™t say whether it would ever be completely healedâ€”in all truth, I doubt it. But if I were to repeat the treatmentâ€”it seems to need some time between treatments, no doubt for the tissue to heal, just as an external wound would. So far as I can tell, the optimum time between treatments of a serious injury is about a month; Geillisâ€”â€ And here his face twitched violently; he had forgotten. He mastered himself with an effort, though, and went on, â€œGeillis thinks that the process may be affected by the phase of the moon, but she is . . .â€

â€œA witch,â€ Roger finished for him.

The look of unhappiness had returned to McEwanâ€™s face, and he lowered his head to hide it.

â€œPerhaps,â€ he said softly. â€œSurely she is . . . an unusual woman.â€

â€œAnd a good thing for the human race that there arenâ€™t more like her,â€ Roger said, but then checked himself. If he could pray for Jack Randallâ€™s immortal soul, he couldnâ€™t do less for his own great-grandmother, homicidal maniac or not. But the immediate problem was to try to extract the hapless soul before him from her clutches before she could destroy Hector McEwan utterly.

â€œDr. McEwan . . . Hector,â€ he said softly, and laid a hand on the doctorâ€™s arm. â€œYou need to go right away from this place, and from her. She wonâ€™t merely bring you great unhappiness or imperil your soulâ€”she may well kill you.â€

A look of surprise momentarily displaced the unhappiness in McEwanâ€™s eyes. He looked aside, pursed his mouth, and glanced back at Roger, side-long, as though afraid to look at him too directly.

â€œSurely you exaggerate,â€ he said, but the words had no force. McEwanâ€™s own Adamâ€™s apple bobbed visibly as he swallowed.

Roger drew a deep, unconstricted breath and felt the cold, damp air fresh in his chest.

â€œNo,â€ he said gently. â€œI donâ€™t. Think about it, aye? And pray, if ye can. There is mercy, aye? And forgiveness.â€

McEwan sighed, too, but not with any sense of freedom in it. He cast his eyes down, fixed them on the muddy lane and the rain-dancing puddles in the low spots.



â€œI cannot,â€ he said, his voice low and hopeless. â€œIâ€™ve . . . tried. I canâ€™t.â€

Rogerâ€™s hand was still on McEwanâ€™s arm. He squeezed, hard, and said, â€œThen Iâ€™ll pray for ye. And for her,â€ he added, hoping no reluctance showed in his voice.

â€œThank you, sir,â€ the doctor said. â€œI value that extremely.â€ But his eyes had lifted and turned, as though he had no power over them, toward Cranesmuir and its smoking chimneys, and Roger knew there was no hope.



HE WALKED BACK to Cranesmuir and waited in the square â€™til the door of the Duncansâ€™ house opened and Buck emerged. The man looked mildly surprisedâ€”but not displeasedâ€”to see Roger, and nodded at him but didnâ€™t speak. They walked together to an ordinary, where they got a room and went upstairs to refresh themselves before supper. The ordinary didnâ€™t run to a bath, but hot water, soap, razor, and towels went some way to restore them to a decent state of cleanliness.

Buck hadnâ€™t spoken a word more than necessary, but he had an odd expressionâ€”half pleased and half ashamedâ€”and kept darting sidelong glances at Roger, as though unsure whether to say something but rather wanting to.

Roger poured a cup of water from the ewer, drank half of it, and set the cup down with an air of resignation.

â€œTell me you didnâ€™t,â€ he said finally. â€œPlease.â€

Buck shot him a quick glance, looking both shocked at the words and slightly amused.

â€œNo,â€ he said, after a pause long enough to knot Rogerâ€™s belly. â€œNo, I didnâ€™t. Iâ€™m no saying I couldnâ€™t have, though,â€ he added. â€œShe . . . wasnâ€™t unwilling.â€

Roger would have said he didnâ€™t want to know, but he wasnâ€™t quite able to deceive himself.

â€œYe tried?â€

Buck nodded, then picked up the cup of water and dashed the remnants into his own face, shaking them off with a whoof of breath.

â€œI kissed her,â€ he said. â€œPut my hand on her breast.â€

Roger had seen the upper slopes of those breasts as they swelled above her deep-green woolen bodice, round and white as snowdropsâ€”but a lot bigger. By a considerable force of will, he kept himself from asking, â€œAnd what happened then?â€

He didnâ€™t have to, though; Buck was obviously reliving the experience and wanted nothing more than to talk about it.

â€œShe put her hand on mine, but she didnâ€™t pull my hand away. Not at first. She went on kissing meâ€”â€ He broke off and looked at Roger, one brow raised. â€œHave ye kissed many women?â€

â€œI havenâ€™t kept count,â€ Roger said, with a slight edge. â€œHave you?â€

â€œFour besides her,â€ Buck said contemplatively. He shook his head. â€œThat was different.â€

â€œIâ€™d expect it would be. Kissing your mother, I meanâ€”â€



â€œNot that kind of different.â€ Buck touched his lips with two fingers, lightly as a girl might. â€œThe other kind. Or maybe I dinna mean that, quite. I kissed a whore once, and it wasna like that at all.â€ He patted his lips absently for a moment, then realized what he was doing and drew his hand away, looking momentarily embarrassed. â€œEver gone wiâ€™ a whore?â€

â€œI have not,â€ Roger said, trying not to sound censorious, but not managing all that well.

Buck shrugged, dismissing it.

â€œWell, so. She kept my hand on her breast while she took her time about kissinâ€™ me. But then . . .â€ He paused, blushing, and Roger drew himself up. Buck, blushing?

â€œWhat, then?â€ he asked, unable to refrain.

â€œWell, she drew it down, ken, over her body, very slow, and still kissinâ€™ me, andâ€”well, I must have heard her skirts rustle, mustnâ€™t I? But I wasna paying attention, because when she took my hand and put it on her . . . erm . . . lady part, I thought Iâ€™d pass out from the shock.â€

â€œHerâ€”was sheâ€”it, I meanâ€”naked?â€

â€œBare as an egg, and just as bald, too,â€ Buck assured him. â€œHave ye ever heard of such a thing?â€

â€œI have, aye.â€

Buck stared at him, green eyes wide.

â€œYe mean your wifeâ€”â€

â€œI bloody donâ€™t,â€ Roger snapped. â€œDonâ€™t ye dare speak of Brianna, an amaidan, or Iâ€™ll gie you your head in your hands to play with.â€

â€œYou and who else?â€ Buck said automatically, but waved a hand to calm Roger. â€œWhy did ye not tell me my mother was a whore?â€

â€œI wouldnâ€™t tell ye something like that, even if I knew it for a fact, and I didnâ€™t,â€ Roger said.

Buck looked at him for a moment in silence, eyes direct. â€œYeâ€™ll never make a decent minister,â€ he said at last, â€œif ye canâ€™t be honest.â€

The words were said objectively, without heatâ€”and stung the more on that account, being true. Roger breathed in hard through his nose and out again.

â€œAll right,â€ he said. And told Buck everything he knew, or thought he knew, concerning Gillian Edgars, alias Geillis Duncan.

â€œJesus God,â€ Buck said, blinking.

â€œAye,â€ Roger said shortly. Buckâ€™s description of his encounter with his mother had given Roger a vividly disturbing image of Brianna, and he hadnâ€™t been able to dismiss it. He hungered for her, and as a result was acutely aware of Buckâ€™s lingering images of Geillis; he saw the manâ€™s hand absently cup itself, fingers drawing slowly in, as though he were guddlingâ€”Christ, he could smell her on Buckâ€™s flesh, pungent and taunting.

â€œSo now yeâ€™ve met her,â€ Roger said abruptly, looking away. â€œAnd now ye ken what she is. Is that enough, do ye think?â€ He was careful to make the question no more than a question, and Buck nodded, but not in answer, more as though he were having an internal conversationâ€”with himself or with Geillis, Roger didnâ€™t know.

â€œMy father,â€ Buck said thoughtfully, without actually answering. â€œFrom what he said when we met him at the MacLarensâ€™ croft, I thought he maybe didna ken her yet. But he was interested, ye could tell that.â€ He looked suddenly at Roger, a thought having struck him.

â€œDâ€™ye think it was meeting us that made himâ€”will make him,â€ he corrected, with a grimace, â€œgo and find her?â€ He glanced down, then back up at Roger. â€œWould I not exist if we hadnâ€™t come to find your wee lad, I mean?â€

Roger felt the usual sense of startled creepiness at realizations of this sort, something like having cold fingers suddenly laid against the small of his back.

â€œMaybe so,â€ he said. â€œBut I doubt yeâ€™ll ever know that. Not for sure.â€

He was glad enough to leave the subject of Geillis Duncan, though Buckâ€™s other parent was probably no less dangerous.

â€œDâ€™ye think ye need to speak with Dougal MacKenzie?â€ Roger asked carefully. He didnâ€™t want to go anywhere near Castle Leoch or the MacKenzies, but Buck had a right to do it if he wanted, and Roger himself had an obligationâ€”two of them, as kin and as priestâ€”to help him if he did. And however such a conversation might work out, he doubted very much that it would be as disconcerting as the meeting with Geillis.

As for dangerous, though . . .

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ Buck said softly, as though talking to himself. â€œI dinna ken what Iâ€™d say to the manâ€”to either of them.â€

That alarmed Roger, who sat up straight.

â€œYe donâ€™t mean yeâ€™d go back to her? Toâ€”your mother?â€

Buckâ€™s mouth curled up on one side.

â€œWell, we really didna say much to each other,â€ he pointed out.

â€œNeither did I,â€ Roger said shortly, â€œto my father.â€

Buck made an indeterminate noise in his throat, and they fell silent, listening to the growing drum of rain on the slates of the roof. The tiny fire dwindled under the rain coming down the chimney and went out, leaving no more than the faint smell of warmth, and after a bit Roger wrapped himself in his cloak and curled up on one side of the bed, waiting for his body to warm enough for sleep to come.

The air through the cracked window was sharp with cold and the tingling smell of wet bracken and pine bark. No place smelled like the Highlands, and Roger found his heart eased by its harsh perfume. He was nearly asleep when Buckâ€™s voice came softly to him through the dark.

â€œIâ€™m glad ye got to say it, though.â€





NO A VERY GOOD PERSON

ROGER HAD INSISTED on camping outside the town, thinking it better to get Buck as far away from Geillis Duncan as was feasible. For once, it wasnâ€™t raining, and theyâ€™d managed to gather enough in the way of pine twigs for a decent wood fire; pine would usually burn even if damp, because of the resin.

â€œIâ€™m no a very good person.â€ The words were quiet and took a moment to register. Roger looked up to see Buck slumped on his rock, a long stick in his hand, poking at the fire in a desultory fashion. Roger rubbed a hand along his jaw. He felt tired, discouraged, and in no mood for more pastoral counseling.

â€œIâ€™ve met worse,â€ he said, after a pause. It sounded unconvincing.

Buck looked at him from under the fringe of blond hair. â€œI wasna looking for contradiction or consolation,â€ he said dryly. â€œIt was a statement of fact. Call it a preface, if ye like.â€

â€œAll right.â€ Roger stretched, yawning, then settled himself. â€œA preface to what? An apology?â€ He saw the question on his ancestorâ€™s face and, irritated, touched his throat. â€œFor this.â€

â€œAh, that.â€ Buck rocked back a little and pursed his lips, eyes fixed on the scar.

â€œAye, that!â€ Roger snapped, irritation flaring suddenly into anger. â€œDo you have any notion what it was ye took from me, you bastard?â€

â€œMaybe a bit.â€ Buck resumed poking at the fire, waiting â€™til the end of his stick caught, then stubbing it out again in the dirt. He fell silent, then, and for a bit there was no sound but the rattle of wind through the dry bracken. A ghost walking by, Roger thought, watching the brown fronds within the circle of firelight stir and then fall still.

â€œI donâ€™t say it as excuse, mind,â€ Buck said at last, eyes still fixed on the fire. â€œBut thereâ€™s the matter of intent. I didna mean to get ye hanged.â€

Roger made a low, vicious noise in response to this. It hurt. He was damned tired of it hurting to speak, or sing, or even grunt.

â€œBugger off,â€ he said abruptly, standing up. â€œJustâ€”bugger off. I donâ€™t want to look at you.â€

Buck gave him a long look, as though debating whether to say something, but then shrugged, got up, and disappeared. He was back within five minutes, though, and sat down with the air of someone who had something to say. Fine, Roger thought. Get on with it.



â€œDid it not occur to the two of ye, whilst reading those letters, that thereâ€™s another way for the past to speak to the future?â€

â€œWell, of course,â€ Roger said, impatient. He stabbed his dirk into one of the turnips to test it; still hard as a rock. â€œWe thought of all sorts of thingsâ€”diaries left under stones, newspaper noticesâ€â€”he grimaced at that oneâ€”â€œand a number of less-useful notions. But most of those options were either too unsure or too risky; thatâ€™s why we arranged to use the banks. But . . .â€

He trailed off. Buck was looking smugly superior.

â€œAnd I suppose youâ€™ve thought of something better?â€ Roger said.

â€œWhy, man, itâ€™s right under your nose.â€ With a smirk, Buck bent to test his own turnip and, evidently finding the results acceptable, lifted it out of the ashes on the point of his dirk.

â€œIf ye think Iâ€™m going to ask youâ€”â€

â€œBeyond thatâ€”â€ Buck said, blowing on the hot turnip between phrases, â€œbeyond thatâ€”itâ€™s the only way for the future to speak to the past.â€

He gave Roger a straight, hard look, and Roger felt as though heâ€™d been stabbed with a screwdriver.

â€œWhatâ€”you?â€ he blurted. â€œYou mean youâ€”â€

Buck nodded, eyes casually on his smoking turnip.

â€œCanâ€™t be you, can it?â€ He looked up suddenly, green eyes catching the firelight. â€œYou wonâ€™t go. Ye wouldnâ€™t trust me to keep looking.â€

â€œIâ€”â€ The words caught in Rogerâ€™s throat, but he was well aware that they showed in his face.

Buckâ€™s own face twisted in a lopsided smile. â€œI would keep looking,â€ he said. â€œBut I see how yeâ€™d not believe me.â€

â€œItâ€™s not that,â€ Roger said, clearing his throat. â€œItâ€™s onlyâ€”I canâ€™t leave while Jem might be here. Not when I donâ€™t know for sure that I could come back if I left and he . . . wasnâ€™t at the other end.â€ He made a helpless gesture. â€œGo, and know I was maybe abandoning him forever?â€

Buck nodded, looking down. Roger saw the other manâ€™s throat move, too, and was struck by a pang of realization.

â€œYour Jem,â€ Roger said softly. â€œYou do know where he is, at least. When, I mean.â€ The question was clear: if Buck was willing to risk the stones again, why would he not do it in search of his own family, rather than to carry a message to Bree?

â€œYeâ€™re all mine, arenâ€™t ye?â€ Buck said gruffly. â€œMy blood. My . . . sons.â€

Despite everything, Roger was moved by that. A little. He coughed, and it didnâ€™t hurt.

â€œEven so,â€ he said. He gave Buck a direct look. â€œWhy? Ye ken it might do for you; it might have done this last time, if McEwan hadnâ€™t been there.â€

â€œMmphm.â€ Buck poked his turnip again and put it back into the fire. â€œAye. Well, I meant it; Iâ€™m no a very good person. No such a waste, I mean, if I didna make it.â€ His lips twisted a little as he glanced up at Roger. â€œYeâ€™ve maybe got a bit more to offer the world.â€

â€œIâ€™m flattered,â€ Roger said dryly. â€œI imagine the world can get on well enough without me, if it came to that.â€

â€œAye, maybe. But maybe your family canâ€™t.â€



There was a long silence while Roger digested that, broken only by the pop of a burning twig and the distant hooting of courting owls.

â€œWhat about your own family?â€ he asked at last, quietly. â€œYe seem to think your wife would be happier without ye. Why? What did ye do to her?â€

Buck made a short, unhappy noise that might have been meant for a wry laugh.

â€œFell in love wiâ€™ her.â€ He took a deep breath, looking down into the fire. â€œWanted her.â€

Heâ€™d met Morag Gunn just after heâ€™d begun reading law with a solicitor in Inverness. The lawyer had been called to go out to a farm near Essich, to draw up a will for an old man, and had taken his junior along to see the way of it.

â€œIt took three days, for the auld man was that ill, he couldna attend more than a few minutes at a time. So we stayed wiâ€™ the family, and Iâ€™d go out to help wiâ€™ the pigs and the chickens when I wasna needed inside.â€ He shrugged. â€œI was young and no bad-looking, and I had the trick of makinâ€™ women like me. And she did like meâ€”but she was in love wiâ€™ Donald McAllister, a young farmer from Daviot.â€

But Buck had been unable to forget the lass, and whenever he had a day free from the law, would ride out to visit. He came for Hogmanay, and there was a cÃ¨ilidh, and . . .

â€œAnd wee Donald had a dramâ€”or two or three or fourâ€”too many and was found in a stall wiâ€™ his hand down Mary Finlayâ€™s bodice. God, the stramash there was!â€ A rueful smile flickered over Buckâ€™s face. â€œMaryâ€™s twa brothers gave Donald laldy and laid him out like a mackerel, and all the lasses were screaminâ€™ and the lads shoutinâ€™ like it was Judgment Day. And poor wee Morag was off behind the cow byre, greetinâ€™ her heart out.â€

â€œYou, um, comforted her,â€ Roger suggested, not trying to keep the skeptical note out of his voice. Buck shot him a sharp glance, then shrugged.

â€œThought it might be my only chance,â€ he said simply. â€œAye. I did. She was the worse for drink herself, and that upset. . . . I didna force her.â€ His lips pressed together. â€œBut I didna take no for an answer, either, and after a bit, she gave up sayinâ€™ it.â€

â€œAye. And when she woke up next morning and realized . . . ?â€

Buck cocked a brow.

â€œShe didna say anything to anyone then. It was two months later when she realized . . .â€ Buck had arrived at Mr. Fergusonâ€™s rooms one day in March to find Morag Gunnâ€™s father and three brothers waiting for him, and as soon as the banns could be read, he was a married man.

â€œSo.â€ Buck took a breath and rubbed a hand over his face. â€œWe . . . got on. I was mad in love wiâ€™ her, and she kent that and tried to be kind to me. But I knew well enough it was Donald sheâ€™d wanted and still did. He was still there, ken, and sheâ€™d see him now and then at cÃ¨ilidhean or the cattle sales.â€

It was knowing that that had made Buck take the opportunity to sail for North Carolina with his wife and small child.

â€œThought sheâ€™d forget,â€ he said, a little bleakly. â€œOr at least I wouldna have to see the look in her eyes when she saw him.â€

But things had gone badly for the MacKenzies in the New World; Buck had failed to establish a practice as a solicitor, they had little money and no land, and they had no one in the way of kinfolk to turn to for help.

â€œSo we came back,â€ Buck said. He rolled the turnip out of the fire and stabbed it with his stick; the black crust broke and oozed white. He stared at the vegetable for a moment, then stamped on it, mashing it into the ashes.

â€œAnd Donald was still there, of course. Was he married?â€

Buck shook his head, then knuckled the hair out of his eyes.

â€œIt was no good,â€ he said softly. â€œIt was true, what I told ye about how I came to pass through the stones. But once Iâ€™d come to myself and discovered how things wereâ€”I kent Morag would be best served if I never came back. Either sheâ€™d give me up for dead after a time and marry Donald, or, at the worst, her father would have her back, wiâ€™ the bairns. Theyâ€™d live wellâ€”her da had inherited the farm, when his auld one died.â€

Rogerâ€™s throat felt tight but it didnâ€™t matter. He reached out and squeezed Buckâ€™s shoulder, hard. Buck gave a small snort, but didnâ€™t pull away.

After a bit, though, he heaved a sigh and straightened up, turning to Roger.

â€œSo ye see,â€ he said. â€œIf I go back and tell your wife whatâ€™s to doâ€”and, with luck, come back to tell youâ€”itâ€™s maybe the one good thing I could do. For my familyâ€”for yours.â€

It took some time for Roger to get his voice sufficiently under control as to speak.

â€œAye,â€ he said. â€œWell. Sleep on it. I mean to go up to Lallybroch. Yeâ€™ll maybe go and see Dougal MacKenzie at Leoch. If ye think ye still . . . mean it, after . . . thereâ€™s time enough to decide then.â€





A BROTHER OF THE LODGE

Craigh na Dun, the Scottish Highlands

December 21, 1980

ESMERALDAâ€™S HAIR was much too red. Somebody will notice. Theyâ€™ll ask questions. You idiot, why are you even thinking about it? Theyâ€™d notice a Barbie in a polka-dot bikini a heck of a lot faster. . . . Brianna shut her eyes for an instant to blot out the sight of Mandyâ€™s rag dolly with her scarlet fright wig, brilliant with a dye much brighter than anything achievable in the eighteenth century. She tripped on a stone, said, â€œS-word!â€ under her breath, and, her eyes having flown open, took a firmer hold of Mandyâ€™s free hand, the other being employed to clutch Esmeralda.

She knew bloody well why she was worrying about the dollâ€™s hair. If she didnâ€™t think of something inconsequential, she was going to turn right around and run down the rocky slope like a panicked hare, dragging Jem and Mandy through the dead gorse.

Weâ€™re going to do it. We have to. Weâ€™ll die, weâ€™ll all die in there, in the black . . . Oh, God, oh, God . . .

â€œMam?â€ Jemmy looked up at her, small brow furrowed. She made a good attemptâ€”she thoughtâ€”at a reassuring smile, but it must have looked less than convincing, judging from his alarmed expression.

â€œItâ€™s okay,â€ she said, abandoning the smile and putting what little conviction she could muster into her voice. â€œItâ€™s okay, Jem.â€

â€œUh-huh.â€ He still looked worried, but he turned his face uphill, and his expression smoothed out, intentness replacing concern. â€œI can hear them,â€ he said softly. â€œCan ye hear them, Mama?â€

That â€œMamaâ€ made her hand tighten, and he winced, though she didnâ€™t think he really noticed. He was listening. She came to a stop, and they all listened. She could hear the rush of the wind and a slight patter as brief rain swept through the brown heather. Mandy was humming to Esmeralda. But Jemâ€™s face was turned upward, serious but not frightened. She could just see the pointed top of one of the stones, barely visible above the crest of the hill.

â€œI canâ€™t, honey,â€ she said, letting out just a bit of the huge breath sheâ€™d been holding. â€œNot yet.â€ What if I canâ€™t hear them at all? What if Iâ€™ve lost it? Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us . . . â€œLetâ€™s . . . get a little closer.â€

Sheâ€™d been frozen inside for the last twenty-four hours. She hadnâ€™t been able to eat or sleep but had kept going, shoving everything aside, tamping it downâ€”refusing to actually believe they were going to do it, yet making the necessary preparations in a state of eerie calmness.

The leather bag hanging from her shoulder clanked a little, reassuring in its solid reality. Weight might be heavy to carryâ€”but it would hold her steady against the pull of wind and water, secure against the earth. Jem had let go of her hand, and she reached compulsively through the slit in her skirt to feel the three hard little lumps in the pocket tied round her waist.

Sheâ€™d been afraid to try synthetic stones, for fear they wouldnâ€™t workâ€”or might explode violently, like the big opal Jemmy had burst into pieces in North Carolina.

Suddenly she was swept by a longing for Fraserâ€™s Ridgeâ€”and her parentsâ€”so intense that tears welled in her eyes. She blinked hard and wiped her eyes on her sleeve, pretending that the wind had made them water. It didnâ€™t matter; neither of the kids was noticing. Now both of them were staring upwardâ€”and she finally realized, with a small, flat thump of dread, that she could hear the stones; they were humming, and Mandy was humming with them.

She glanced behind her involuntarily, checking to be sure that they hadnâ€™t been followedâ€”but they had. Lionel Menzies was coming up the path behind them, climbing fast.



â€œF-word!â€ she said aloud, and Jem whirled to see what was going on.

â€œMr. Menzies!â€ he said, and his face broke into a smile of relief. â€œMr. Menzies!â€

Bree gestured firmly to Jem to stay where he was and took a couple of steps down the steep path toward Menzies, little rocks sliding under her shoes and bouncing downhill toward him.

â€œDonâ€™t be afraid,â€ he said, coming up breathlessly and stopping just below her. â€œIâ€”I had to come, be sure you were safe. That youâ€”that youâ€”get away.â€ He nodded upward, looking beyond her. She didnâ€™t turn to look; she could feel the stones now, humming gentlyâ€”for the momentâ€”in her bones.

â€œWeâ€™re okay,â€ she said, her voice surprisingly steady. â€œReally. Er . . . thank you,â€ she added, belatedly polite.

His face was pale and a little strained, but quirked into a small smile at that.

â€œMy pleasure,â€ he said, with equal politeness. But he didnâ€™t move to turn and go away. She breathed for a moment, realizing that the frozen core had thawed. She was alive again, completely, and thoroughly on the alert.

â€œIs there some reason why we might not be safe?â€ she asked, watching his eyes behind the glasses. He grimaced slightly and glanced over his shoulder.

â€œShit,â€ she said. â€œWho? Rob Cameron?â€ She spoke sharply and heard the creak of gravel under Jemâ€™s shoes as he turned sharply, hearing the name.

â€œHim and his friends, yes.â€ He nodded uphill. â€œYou, um, really should go. Now, I mean.â€

Brianna said something really bad in Gaelic, and Jemmy gave a nervous giggle. She glared at Menzies.

â€œAnd just what were you planning to do if Rob and his band of jerks all turned up after us?â€

â€œWhat I just did do,â€ he said simply. â€œWarn you. Iâ€™d bloody go if I were you. Your, um, daughter . . . ?â€

She whirled round to see Mandy, Esmeralda in the crook of one arm, stumping laboriously up the path.

â€œJem!â€ She took one giant step, seized him by the hand, and they bolted up the hill after Mandy, leaving Lionel Menzies on the path below.

They caught Mandy up right at the edge of the circle, and Bree tried to grab Mandyâ€™s hand but missed. She could hear Lionel Menzies coming up behind them. â€œMandy!â€ She grabbed the little girl and stood, panting, surrounded by stones. The hum was higher-pitched and making her teeth itch; she gnashed them once or twice, trying to rid herself of the feeling, and saw Menzies blink. Good.

Then she heard the sound of a carâ€™s engine below and saw Menziesâ€™s face change to a look of acute alarm.

â€œGo!â€ he said. â€œPlease!â€

She fumbled under her skirt, hands shaking, and finally got hold of all three stones. They were the same kind, small emeralds, though of slightly different cut. Sheâ€™d chosen them because they reminded her of Rogerâ€™s eyes. Thought of him steadied her.

â€œJem,â€ she said, and put a stone in his hand. â€œAnd, Mandyâ€”hereâ€™s yours. Put them in your pockets, andâ€”â€

But Mandy, little fist clutching her emerald, had turned toward the biggest of the standing stones. Her mouth drooped open for a moment, and then suddenly her face brightened as though someone had lit a candle inside her.

â€œDaddy!â€ she shrieked, and, yanking her hand out of Briannaâ€™s, raced directly toward the cleft stoneâ€”and into it.

â€œJesus!â€ Brianna barely heard Menziesâ€™s shocked exclamation. She ran toward the stone, tripped over Esmeralda, and fell full length in the grass, knocking out her wind.

â€œMama!â€ Jem paused for a moment beside her, glancing wildly back and forth between her and the stone where his little sister had just vanished.

â€œIâ€™m . . . okay,â€ she managed, and with that assurance, Jem charged across the clearing, calling back, â€œIâ€™ll get her, Mam!â€

She gulped air and tried to shriek after him, but made only a wheezing croak. The sound of feet made her glance fearfully round, but it was only Lionel, whoâ€™d run to the edge of the circle, peering down the hillside. In the distance, she could hear car doors slamming. Doors. More than one . . .

She staggered to her feet; sheâ€™d fallen on the bag and bruised her ribs, but that didnâ€™t matter. She limped toward the cleft stone, pausing only to scoop up Esmeralda by reflex. God, God, God . . . was the only thought in her head, an agony of unworded prayer.

And suddenly the prayer was answered. Both of them stood in front of her, swaying and white-faced. Mandy threw up; Jem sat down hard on his bottom and slumped there, wavering.

â€œOh, God . . .â€ She ran to them, grabbed them hard against her in spite of the nastiness. Jem clung to her a moment, but then pushed himself away.

â€œMam,â€ he said, and his voice was breathless with joy. â€œMam, heâ€™s there. We could feel him. We can find himâ€”we gotta go, Mam!â€

â€œYou do.â€ It was Lionel back, breathless and scared, tugging at Briannaâ€™s cloak, trying to straighten it for her. â€œTheyâ€™re comingâ€”three of them.â€

â€œYes, Iâ€”â€ But then realization struck her, and she turned to the children in panic. â€œJem, Mandy . . . your stonesâ€”where are they?â€

â€œBurned up,â€ Mandy said solemnly, and spat into the grass. â€œPuh-toody! Yuck.â€ She wiped her mouth.

â€œWhat do you meanâ€”â€

â€œYeah, they are, Mam. See?â€ Jem turned out the pocket of his breeches, showing her the burnt spot and the smear of carbon black around it, smelling strongly of scorched wool.

Frantic, she fumbled at Mandyâ€™s clothes, finding the same scorch mark on the side of her skirt, where the vaporized stone had burned through from her pocket.

â€œDid it burn you, honey?â€ she asked, running a hand down Mandyâ€™s sturdy little thigh.

â€œNot much,â€ Mandy reassured her.

â€œBrianna! For Godâ€™s sakeâ€”I canâ€™tâ€”â€

â€œI canâ€™t!â€ she shouted, rounding on him, fists clenched. â€œThe kidsâ€™ stones are gone! They canâ€™tâ€”they canâ€™t go through without them!â€ She didnâ€™t know for sure that this was true, but the thought of letting them try to go into that . . . that . . . without the protection of a stone shriveled her stomach, and she nearly wept with fright and exasperation.

â€œStones,â€ he repeated, looking blank. â€œJewels, do you mean? Gemstones?â€

â€œYes!â€

He stood for an instant with his mouth open, then fell to his knees, yanking at his left hand, and the next instant was whacking his right hand feverishly against a rock that lay half sunk in the grass.

Bree stared at him helplessly for a moment, then ran to the edge of the circle, ducked round a stone, and stood flat against it in the shadow, looking out. By peering sideways, she could just see human forms, halfway up the hill and moving fast.

On the other side of the stone, Menzies gave a grunt of pain or frustration and smacked something hard against the rock, with a small cracking noise.

â€œBrianna!â€ he called, urgent, and she rushed back, afraid the children were trying to go throughâ€”but it was all right; they were standing in front of Lionel Menzies, who was stooping over Mandy, holding one of her hands.

â€œCurl up your fist, wee lassie,â€ he said, almost gently. â€œAye, thatâ€™s it. And, Jemâ€”here, put out your hand.â€ Brianna was close enough now to see that it was a small glittering thing he put in Jemâ€™s palmâ€”and that Mandyâ€™s fist was curled around a large ring, rather battered, with a Masonic emblem carved into its onyxâ€”and the twin of Jemâ€™s small diamond winking beside it, an empty socket on the other side.

â€œLionel,â€ she said, and he reached out and touched her cheek.

â€œGo now,â€ he said. â€œI canâ€™t leave until ye go. Once youâ€™re gone, though, Iâ€™ll run for it.â€

She nodded jerkily, once, then stooped and took the childrenâ€™s hands. â€œJemâ€”put that in your other pocket, okay?â€ She gulped air and turned toward the big cleft stone. The racket of it hammered at her blood and she could feel it pulling, trying to take her apart.

â€œMandy,â€ she said, and could barely hear her own voice. â€œLetâ€™s find Daddy. Donâ€™t let go.â€

It was only as the screaming began that she realized sheâ€™d not said â€œThank you,â€ and then she thought no more.





THE BURYING GROUND

SHE LOVED LALLYBROCH in winter. The gorse and broom and heather didnâ€™t seem to die so much as simply to fade back into the landscape, the purple heather fading to a soft brown shadow of itself and the broom to a cluster of dry sticks, their long flat pods rattling softly in the wind. Today the air was cold and still, and the soft gray smoke from the chimneys rose straight up to touch the lowering sky.

â€œHome, weâ€™re home!â€ Mandy said, hopping up and down. â€œGoody, goody, goody! Can I have a Coke?â€

â€œIt isnâ€™t home, goofy,â€ Jem said. Only the pink tip of his nose and a flicker of eyelash was visible in the gap between his woolly hat and the muffler round his neck. His breath wisped white. â€œItâ€™sâ€”then. They donâ€™t have Cokes now. Besides,â€ he added logically, â€œitâ€™s too cold to drink Coke. Your tummy would freeze.â€

â€œHuh?â€

â€œNever mind, honey,â€ Brianna said, and tightened her grasp on Mandyâ€™s hand. They were standing at the crest of the hill behind the house, near the remains of the Iron Age fort. It had been a laborious haul up the hill, but sheâ€™d been reluctant to approach the house from the front, where they would have been visible for a good quarter mile, coming across open ground.

â€œCan you feel Daddy anywhere nearby?â€ she asked the children. Sheâ€™d automatically looked for Rogerâ€™s old orange Morris in the drive as theyâ€™d crested the hillâ€”and felt a ridiculous plunge of spirits at seeing neither car nor graveled drive. Jem shook his head; Mandy didnâ€™t answer, distracted by a faint bleating from below.

â€œIss sheep!â€ she said, delighted. â€œLetâ€™s go see da sheep!â€

â€œItâ€™s not sheep,â€ Jem said, rather crossly. â€œItâ€™s goats. Theyâ€™re in the broch. Can we go down now, Mam? My nose is about to fall off.â€

She was still hesitant, watching the house. Every muscle was straining, pulling toward it. Home. But it wasnâ€™t her home, not now. Roger. â€œThe strong, sweet, supple quality he has . . .â€

Of course, she knew that he likely wasnâ€™t here; he and Buck would be searching somewhere for Jerry MacKenzie. And what if they found him? she thought, with a little thump of something between excitement and fear.

The fear was what was stopping her racing down the hill to hammer on the door and meet whatever of her family happened to be home today. Sheâ€™d spent the last few days on the road, and the hours on the final walk from where the carter had dropped them, trying to decideâ€”and her mind was still as divided as ever.

â€œCome on,â€ she said to the kids. She couldnâ€™t keep them standing out here in the cold while she made up her mind. â€œLetâ€™s visit the goats first.â€

The smell of goats struck her the moment she opened the doorâ€”pungent, warm, and familiar. Warm, above all; all three humans sighed in relief and pleasure as the animal heat rolled over them, and they smiled at the eager rush and outcry of mehhs that greeted their presence.

From the noise that echoed off the stone walls, there might have been fifty goats inside the brochâ€”though Brianna counted only half a dozen nannies, flop-eared and dainty, four or five half-grown, round-bellied kids, and a single robust billy goat who lowered his horns and glowered at them, suspicious and yellow-eyed. All of them shared a rough pen that fenced off half the ground floor of the broch. She glanced upâ€”but instead of the exposed rafters high above that she half-expected to see, there was the intact underside of another floor above.

The kidsâ€”her kids, that is, and she smiled at the thoughtâ€”were already sticking wisps of hay through the fence and playing with the young goats, who were standing on their back legs to peer at the visitors.

â€œJemmy, Mandy!â€ she called. â€œTake off your hats and mufflers and mittens and put them over by the door, so the goats donâ€™t chew on them!â€ She left Jem to distentangle Mandy from her fuzzy muffler and went up the stair to see what was on the second floor.

Pale winter light from the windows striped the haunches of burlap bags that filled most of the floor space. She breathed in and coughed a little; flour dust was floating in the air, but she smelled the sweetness of dried cornâ€”maize, they called itâ€”and the deeper, nutty smell of ripe barley, as well, and when she nudged her foot against a particularly lumpy sack, she heard the shift and clack of hazelnuts. Lallybroch wouldnâ€™t starve this winter.

Curious, she went up one more flight and on the top floor found a good number of small wooden casks arrayed against the wall. It was much colder up here, but the heady aroma of good whisky filled the air with the illusion of warmth. She stood breathing it in for a moment, wanting very badly to be drunk on the fumes, to obliviate her mind, be able not to bloody think, if only for a few minutes.

But that was the last thing she could do. In minutes, sheâ€™d have to act.

She stepped back onto the narrow stair that wound up between the inner and outer walls of the broch and looked out toward the house, with vivid memories of the last time she had been here, crouched on the stair in the dark with a shotgun in her hands, watching the light of strangers in her house.

There were strangers here now, too, although her own blood. What if . . . She swallowed. If Roger had found Jerry MacKenzie, his father would be only in his early twentiesâ€”much younger than Roger himself. And if her own da was here nowâ€”

â€œHe canâ€™t be,â€ she whispered to herself, and wasnâ€™t sure if that was reassurance or regret. Sheâ€™d met him for the first time in North Carolina, pissing against a tree. Heâ€™d been in his forties, she twenty-two.

You couldnâ€™t enter your own lifeline, couldnâ€™t exist in the same time twice. They thought they knew that for sure. But what if you entered someone elseâ€™s life twice, at different times?

That was what was turning her blood to ice and making her curled fists tremble. What happened? Did one or the other of your appearances change things, perhaps cancel out the other? Would it not happen that way, would she not meet Jamie Fraser in North Carolina if she met him now?

But she had to find Roger. No matter what else happened. And Lallybroch was the only place she knew for sure heâ€™d been. She took a deep, deep breath and closed her eyes.

Please, she prayed. Please help me. Thy will be done, but please show me what to do . . .

â€œMam!â€ Jemmy came running up the stair, his footsteps loud in the confined stone corridor. â€œMam!â€ He popped into sight, blue eyes round and hair standing half on end with excitement. â€œMam, come down! A manâ€™s coming!â€

â€œWhat does he look like?â€ she asked, urgent, grabbing him by the sleeve. â€œWhat color is his hair?â€

He blinked, surprised.

â€œBlack, I think. Heâ€™s at the bottom of the hillâ€”I couldnâ€™t see his face.â€

Roger.

â€œAll right. Iâ€™m coming.â€ She felt half choked but no longer frozen. It was happening now, whatever it was, and energy fizzed through her veins.

Even as she hurtled down the stairs behind Jemmy, rationality told her that it wasnâ€™t Rogerâ€”distance or not, Jemmy would know his father. But she had to see.

â€œStay here,â€ she said to the children, with so much command in her voice that they blinked but didnâ€™t argue. She threw open the door, saw the man coming up the path, and stepped out to meet him, closing the door firmly behind her.

From the first glance, she saw that it wasnâ€™t Roger, but the disappointment was subsumed at once in relief that it wasnâ€™t Jamie. And intense curiosity, because it must surely be . . .

Sheâ€™d run down the path, to get well away from the broch, just in case, and was picking her way through the stones of the family burying ground, eyes on the man coming up the steep, rocky path.

A tall, solid-looking man, his dark hair graying a little but still thick, glossy, and loose on his shoulders. His eyes were on the rough ground, watching his footing. And then he came to his destination and made his way across the hill, to one of the stones in the burying ground. He knelt by it and laid down something heâ€™d been carrying in his hand.

She shifted her weight, uncertain whether to call out or wait â€™til heâ€™d finished his business with the dead. But the small stones under her feet shifted, too, rolling down with a click-clack-click that made him look up and, seeing her, rise abruptly to his feet, black brows raised.

Black hair, black brows. Brian Dubh. Black Brian.

I met Brian Fraser (you would like him, and he, you) . . .

Wide, startled hazel eyes met hers, and for a second that was all she saw. His beautiful deep-set eyes, and the expression of stunned horror in them.

â€œBrian,â€ she said. â€œIâ€”â€

â€œA Dhia!â€ He went whiter than the harled plaster of the house below. â€œEllen!â€

Astonishment deprived her of speech for an instantâ€”long enough to hear light footsteps scrambling down the hill behind her.

â€œMam!â€ Jem called, breathless.

Brianâ€™s glance turned up, behind her, and his mouth fell open at sight of Jem. Then a look of radiant joy suffused his face.

â€œWillie!â€ he said. â€œA bhalaich! Mo bhalaich!â€ He looked back at Brianna and stretched out a trembling hand to her. â€œMo ghrÃ idh . . . mo chridhe . . .â€

â€œBrian,â€ she said softly, her heart in her voice, filled with pity and love, unable to do anything but respond to the need of the soul that showed so clearly in his lovely eyes. And with her speaking of his name for the second time, he stopped dead, swaying for a moment, and then the eyes rolled up in his head and he fell.



SHE WAS KNEELING in the crunchy dead heather beside Brian Fraser before sheâ€™d even thought to move. There was a slight blue tinge to his lips, but he was breathing, and she drew a deep cold breath of relief herself, seeing his chest rise slowly under the worn linen shirt.

Not for the first time, she wished fervently that her mother was there, but turned his head to one side and laid two fingers on the pulse she could see at the side of his neck. Her fingers were cold, and his flesh was startlingly warm. He didnâ€™t rouse or stir at her touch, though, and she began to fear that he hadnâ€™t just fainted.

Heâ€™d diedâ€”would dieâ€”of a stroke. If there was some weakness in his brain . . . oh, God. Had she just killed him prematurely?

â€œDonâ€™t die!â€ she said to him aloud. â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, donâ€™t die here!â€

She glanced hastily toward the house below, but no one was coming. Looking down again, she saw what it was heâ€™d held: a small bouquet of evergreen twigs, tied with red thread. Yewâ€”she recognized the oddly tubular red berriesâ€”and holly.

And then she saw the stone. She knew it well, had sat on the ground beside it often, contemplating Lallybroch and those who lay sleeping on its hillside.
