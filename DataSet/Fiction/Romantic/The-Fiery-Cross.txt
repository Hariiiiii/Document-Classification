Rumors of War

AN INTERRUPTED

CONVERSATION




THE DOG SENSED THEM FIRST. Dark as it was, Ian Murray felt rather than saw Rolloâ€™s head lift suddenly near his thigh, ears pricking. He put a hand on the dogâ€™s neck, and felt the hair there ridged with warning.

So attuned as they were to each other, he did not even think consciously, â€œMen,â€ but put his other hand to his knife and lay still, breathing. Listening.

The forest was quiet. It was hours â€™til dawn and the air was still as that in a church, with a mist like incense rising slowly up from the ground. He had lain down to rest on the fallen trunk of a giant tulip tree, preferring the tickle of wood-lice to seeping damp. He kept his hand on the dog, waiting.

Rollo was growling, a low, constant rumble that Ian could barely hear but felt easily, the vibration of it traveling up his arm, arousing all the nerves of his body. He hadnâ€™t been asleepâ€”he rarely slept at night anymoreâ€”but had been quiet, looking up into the vault of the sky, engrossed in his usual argument with God. Quietness had vanished with Rolloâ€™s movement. He sat up slowly, swinging his legs over the side of the half-rotted log, heart beating fast now.

Rolloâ€™s warning hadnâ€™t changed, but the great head swiveled, following something unseen. It was a moonless night; Ian could see the faint silhouettes of trees and the moving shadows of the night, but nothing more.

Then he heard them. Sounds of passage. A good distance away, but coming nearer by the moment. He stood and stepped softly into the pool of black under a balsam fir. A click of the tongue, and Rollo left off his growling and followed, silent as the wolf who had been his father.

Ianâ€™s resting-place overlooked a game trail. The men who followed it were not hunting.

White men. Now that was odd, and more than odd. He couldnâ€™t see them, but didnâ€™t need to; the noise they made was unmistakable. Indians traveling were not silent, and many of the Highlanders he lived among could move like ghosts in the woodâ€”but he had no doubt whatever. Metal, that was it. He was hearing the jingle of harness, the clink of buttons and bucklesâ€”and gun barrels.

A lot of them. So close, he began to smell them. He leaned forward a little, eyes closed, the better to snuff up what clue he could.

They carried pelts; now he picked up the dried-blood cold-fur smell that had probably waked Rolloâ€”but not trappers, surely; too many. Trappers moved in ones and twos.

Poor men, and dirty. Not trappers, and not hunters. Game was easy to come by at this season, but they smelled of hunger. And the sweat of bad drink.

Close by now, perhaps ten feet from the place where he stood. Rollo made a tiny snorting sound, and Ian closed his hand once more on the dogâ€™s ruff, but the men made too much noise to hear it. He counted the passing footsteps, the bumping of canteens and bullet boxes, foot-sore grunts and sighs of weariness.

Twenty-three men, he made it, and there was a muleâ€”no, two mules with them; he could hear the creak of laden panniers and that querulous heavy breathing, the way a loaded mule did, always on the verge of complaint.

The men would never have detected them, but some freak of the air bore Rolloâ€™s scent to the mules. A deafening bray shattered the dark, and the forest erupted in front of him with a clishmaclaver of crashing and startled shouts. Ian was already running when pistol shots crashed behind him.

â€œA Dhia!â€ Something struck him in the head and he fell headlong. Was he killed?

No. Rollo was pushing a worried wet nose into his ear. His head buzzed like a hive and he saw bright flashes of light before his eyes.

â€œRun! Ruith!â€ he gasped, pushing at the dog. â€œRun out! Go!â€ The dog hesitated, whining deep in his throat. He couldnâ€™t see, but felt the big body lunge and turn, turn back, undecided.

â€œRuith!â€ He got himself up onto hands and knees, urging, and the dog at last obeyed, running as he had been trained.

There was no time to run himself, even could he have gained his feet. He fell facedown, thrust hands and feet deep into the leaf mold, and wriggled madly, burrowing in.

A foot struck between his shoulder blades, but the breath it drove out of him was muffled in wet leaves. It didnâ€™t matter, they were making so much noise. Whoever had stepped on him didnâ€™t notice; it was a glancing blow as the man ran over him in panic, doubtless thinking him a rotted log.

The shooting ceased. The shouting didnâ€™t, but he made no sense of it. He knew he was lying flat on his face, cold damp on his cheeks and the tang of dead leaves in his noseâ€”but felt as though very drunk, the world revolving slowly round him. His head didnâ€™t hurt much, past the first burst of pain, but he didnâ€™t seem able to lift it.

He had the dim thought that if he died here, no one would know. His mother would mind, he thought, not knowing what had become of him.

The noises grew fainter, more orderly. Someone was still bellowing, but it had the sound of command. They were leaving. It occurred to him dimly that he might call out. If they knew he was white, they might help him. And they might not.

He kept quiet. Either he was dying or he wasnâ€™t. If he was, no help was possible. If he wasnâ€™t, none was needed.

Well, I asked then, didnâ€™t I? he thought, resuming his conversation with God, calm as though he lay still on the trunk of the tulip tree, looking up into the depths of heaven above. A sign, I said. I didna quite expect Ye to be so prompt about it, though.

DUTCH CABIN




March 1773

NO ONE HAD KNOWN the cabin was there, until Kenny Lindsay had seen the flames, on his way up the creek.

â€œI wouldna haâ€™ seen at all,â€ he said, for perhaps the sixth time. â€œSave for the dark cominâ€™ on. Had it been daylight, Iâ€™d never haâ€™ kent it, never.â€ He wiped a trembling hand over his face, unable to take his eyes off the line of bodies that lay at the edge of the forest. â€œWas it savages, Mac Dubh? Theyâ€™re no scalped, but maybeâ€”â€

â€œNo.â€ Jamie laid the soot-smeared handkerchief gently back over the staring blue face of a small girl. â€œNone of them is wounded. Surely ye saw as much when ye brought them out?â€

Lindsay shook his head, eyes closed, and shivered convulsively. It was late afternoon, and a chilly spring day, but the men were all sweating.

â€œI didna look,â€ he said simply.

My own hands were like ice; as numb and unfeeling as the rubbery flesh of the dead woman I was examining. They had been dead for more than a day; the rigor of death had passed off, leaving them limp and chilled, but the cold weather of the mountain spring had preserved them so far from the grosser indignities of putrefaction.

Still, I breathed shallowly; the air was bitter with the scent of burning. Wisps of steam rose now and then from the charred ruin of the tiny cabin. From the corner of my eye, I saw Roger kick at a nearby log, then bend and pick up something from the ground beneath.

Kenny had pounded on our door long before daylight, summoning us from warm beds. We had come in haste, even knowing that we were far too late to offer aid. Some of the tenants from the homesteads on Fraserâ€™s Ridge had come, too; Kennyâ€™s brother Evan stood with Fergus and Ronnie Sinclair in a small knot under the trees, talking together in low-voiced Gaelic.

â€œDâ€™ye ken what did for them, Sassenach?â€ Jamie squatted beside me, face troubled. â€œThe ones under the trees, that is.â€ He nodded at the corpse in front of me. â€œI ken what killed this puir woman.â€

The womanâ€™s long skirt stirred in the wind, lifting to show long, slender feet shod in leather clogs. A pair of long hands to match lay still at her sides. She had been tallâ€”though not so tall as Brianna, I thought, and looked automatically for my daughterâ€™s bright hair, bobbing among the branches on the far side of the clearing.

I had turned the womanâ€™s apron up to cover her head and upper body. Her hands were red, rough-knuckled with work, and with callused palms, but from the firmness of her thighs and the slenderness of her body, I thought she was no more than thirtyâ€”likely much younger. No one could say whether she had been pretty.

I shook my head at his remark.

â€œI donâ€™t think she died of the burning,â€ I said. â€œSee, her legs and feet arenâ€™t touched. She must have fallen into the hearth. Her hair caught fire, and it spread to the shoulders of her gown. She must have lain near enough to the wall or the chimney hood for the flames to touch; that caught, and then the whole bloody place went up.â€

Jamie nodded slowly, eyes on the dead woman.

â€œAye, that makes sense. But what was it killed them, Sassenach? The others are singed a bit, though none are burned like this. But they must have been dead before the cabin caught alight, for none oâ€™ them ran out. Was it a deadly illness, perhaps?â€

â€œI donâ€™t think so. Let me look at the others again.â€

I walked slowly down the row of still bodies with their cloth-covered faces, stooping over each one to peer again beneath the makeshift shrouds. There were any number of illnesses that could be quickly fatal in these daysâ€”with no antibiotics to hand, and no way of administering fluids save by mouth or rectum, a simple case of diarrhea could kill within twenty-four hours.

I saw such things often enough to recognize them easily; any doctor does, and I had been a doctor for more than twenty years. I saw things now and then in this century that I had never encountered in my ownâ€”particularly horrible parasitical diseases, brought with the slave trade from the tropicsâ€”but it was no parasite that had done for these poor souls, and no illness that I knew, to leave such traces on its victims.

All the bodiesâ€”the burned woman, a much older woman, and three childrenâ€”had been found inside the walls of the flaming house. Kenny had pulled them out, just before the roof fell in, then ridden for help. All dead before the fire started; all dead virtually at the same time, then, for surely the fire had begun to smolder soon after the woman fell dead on her hearth?

The victims had been laid out neatly under the branches of a giant red spruce, while the men began to dig a grave nearby. Brianna stood by the smallest girl, her head bent. I came to kneel by the little body, and she knelt down across from me.

â€œWhat was it?â€ she asked quietly. â€œPoison?â€

I glanced up at her in surprise.

â€œI think so. What gave you that idea?â€

She nodded at the blue-tinged face below us. She had tried to close the eyes, but they bulged beneath the lids, giving the little girl a look of startled horror. The small, blunt features were twisted in a rictus of agony, and there were traces of vomit in the corners of the mouth.

â€œGirl Scout handbook,â€ Brianna said. She glanced at the men, but no one was near enough to hear. Her mouth twitched, and she looked away from the body, holding out her open hand. â€œNever eat any strange mushroom,â€ she quoted. â€œThere are many poisonous varieties, and distinguishing one from another is a job for an expert. Roger found these, growing in a ring by that log over there.â€

Moist, fleshy caps, a pale brown with white warty spots, the open gills and slender stems so pale as to look almost phosphorescent in the spruce shadows. They had a pleasant, earthy look to them that belied their deadliness.

â€œPanther toadstools,â€ I said, half to myself, and picked one gingerly from her palm. â€œAgaricus pantherinusâ€”or thatâ€™s what they will be called, once somebody gets round to naming them properly. Pantherinus, because they kill so swiftlyâ€”like a striking cat.â€

I could see the gooseflesh ripple on Briannaâ€™s forearm, raising the soft, red-gold hairs. She tilted her hand and spilled the rest of the deadly fungus on the ground.

â€œWho in their right mind would eat toadstools?â€ she asked, wiping her hand on her skirt with a slight shudder.

â€œPeople who didnâ€™t know better. People who were hungry, perhaps,â€ I answered softly. I picked up the little girlâ€™s hand, and traced the delicate bones of the forearm. The small belly showed signs of bloat, whether from malnutrition or postmortem changes I couldnâ€™t tellâ€”but the collarbones were sharp as scythe blades. All of the bodies were thin, though not to the point of emaciation.

I looked up, into the deep blue shadows of the mountainside above the cabin. It was early in the year for foraging, but there was food in abundance in the forestâ€”for those who could recognize it.

Jamie came and knelt down beside me, a big hand lightly on my back. Cold as it was, a trickle of sweat streaked his neck, and his thick auburn hair was dark at the temples.

â€œThe grave is ready,â€ he said, speaking low, as though he might alarm the child. â€œIs that whatâ€™s killed the bairn?â€ He nodded at the scattered fungi.

â€œI think soâ€”and the rest of them, too. Have you had a look around? Does anyone know who they were?â€

He shook his head.

â€œNot English; the clothes are wrong. Germans would have gone to Salem, surely; theyâ€™re clannish souls, and no inclined to settle on their own. These were maybe Dutchmen.â€ He nodded toward the carved wooden clogs on the old womanâ€™s feet, cracked and stained with long use. â€œNo books nor writing left, if there was any to begin with. Nothing that might tell their name. Butâ€”â€

â€œThey hadnâ€™t been here long.â€ A low, cracked voice made me look up. Roger had come; he squatted next to Brianna, nodding toward the smoldering remains of the cabin. A small garden plot had been scratched into the earth nearby, but the few plants showing were no more than sprouts, the tender leaves limp and blackened with late frost. There were no sheds, no sign of livestock, no mule or pig.

â€œNew emigrants,â€ Roger said softly. â€œNot bond servants; this was a family. They werenâ€™t used to outdoor labor, either; the womenâ€™s hands have blisters and fresh scars.â€ His own broad hand rubbed unconsciously over a homespun knee; his palms were as smoothly callused as Jamieâ€™s now, but he had once been a tender-skinned scholar; he remembered the pain of his seasoning.

â€œI wonder if they left people behindâ€”in Europe,â€ Brianna murmured. She smoothed blond hair off the little girlâ€™s forehead, and laid the kerchief back over her face. I saw her throat move as she swallowed. â€œTheyâ€™ll never know what happened to them.â€

â€œNo.â€ Jamie stood abruptly. â€œThey do say that God protects foolsâ€”but I think even the Almighty will lose patience now and then.â€ He turned away, motioning to Lindsay and Sinclair.

â€œLook for the man,â€ he said to Lindsay. Every head jerked up to look at him.

â€œMan?â€ Roger said, and then glanced sharply at the burned remnants of the cabin, realization dawning. â€œAyeâ€”who built the cabin for them?â€

â€œThe women could have done it,â€ Bree said, lifting her chin.

â€œYou could, aye,â€ he said, mouth twitching slightly as he cast a sidelong look at his wife. Brianna resembled Jamie in more than coloring; she stood six feet in her stockings and had her fatherâ€™s clean-limbed strength.

â€œPerhaps they could, but they didnâ€™t,â€ Jamie said shortly. He nodded toward the shell of the cabin, where a few bits of furniture still held their fragile shapes. As I watched, the evening wind came down, scouring the ruin, and the shadow of a stool collapsed noiselessly into ash, flurries of soot and char moving ghostlike over the ground.

â€œWhat do you mean?â€ I stood and moved beside him, looking into the house. There was virtually nothing left inside, though the chimney stack still stood, and jagged bits of the walls remained, their logs fallen like jackstraws.

â€œThereâ€™s no metal,â€ he said, nodding at the blackened hearth, where the remnants of a cauldron lay, cracked in two from the heat, its contents vaporized. â€œNo pots, save thatâ€”and thatâ€™s too heavy to carry away. Nay tools. Not a knife, not an axâ€”and ye see whoever built it had that.â€

I did; the logs were unpeeled, but the notches and ends bore the clear marks of an ax.

Frowning, Roger picked up a long pine branch and began to poke through the piles of ash and rubble, looking to be sure. Kenny Lindsay and Sinclair didnâ€™t bother; Jamie had told them to look for a man, and they promptly went to do so, disappearing into the forest. Fergus went with them; Evan Lindsay, his brother Murdo, and the McGillivrays began the chore of collecting stones for a cairn.

â€œIf there was a manâ€”did he leave them?â€ Brianna murmured to me, glancing from her father to the row of bodies. â€œDid this woman maybe think they wouldnâ€™t survive on their own?â€

And thus take her own life, and those of her children, to avoid a long-drawn-out death from cold and starvation?

â€œLeave them and take all their tools? God, I hope not.â€ I crossed myself at the thought, though even as I did so, I doubted it. â€œWouldnâ€™t they have walked out, looking for help? Even with children . . . the snowâ€™s mostly gone.â€ Only the highest mountain passes were still packed with snow, and while the trails and slopes were wet and muddy with runoff, theyâ€™d been passable for a month, at least.

â€œIâ€™ve found the man,â€ Roger said, interrupting my thoughts. He spoke very calmly, but paused to clear his throat. â€œJustâ€”just here.â€

The daylight was beginning to fade, but I could see that he had gone pale. No wonder; the curled form he had unearthed beneath the charred timbers of a fallen wall was sufficiently gruesome as to give anyone pause. Charred to blackness, hands upraised in the boxerâ€™s pose so common to those dead by fire, it was difficult even to be sure that it was a manâ€”though I thought it was, from what I could see.

Speculation about this new body was interrupted by a shout from the forestâ€™s edge.

â€œWeâ€™ve found them, milord!â€

Everyone looked up from contemplation of this new corpse, to see Fergus waving from the edge of the wood.

â€œThem,â€ indeed. Two men, this time. Sprawled on the ground within the shadow of the trees, found not together, but not far apart, only a short distance from the house. And both, so far as I could tell, probably dead of mushroom poisoning.

â€œThatâ€™s no Dutchman,â€ Sinclair said, for probably the fourth time, shaking his head over one body.

â€œHe might be,â€ said Fergus dubiously. He scratched his nose with the tip of the hook he wore in replacement of his left hand. â€œFrom the Indies, non?â€

One of the unknown bodies was in fact that of a black man. The other was white, and both wore nondescript clothes of worn homespunâ€”shirts and breeches; no jackets, despite the cold weather. And both were barefoot.

â€œNo.â€ Jamie shook his head, rubbing one hand unconsciously on his own breeches, as though to rid himself of the touch of the dead. â€œThe Dutch keep slaves on Barbuda, ayeâ€”but these are better fed than the folk from the cabin.â€ He lifted his chin toward the silent row of women and children. â€œThey didna live here. Besides . . .â€ I saw his eyes fix on the dead menâ€™s feet.

The feet were grubby about the ankles and heavily callused, but basically clean. The soles of the black manâ€™s feet showed yellowish pink, with no smears of mud or random leaves stuck between the toes. These men hadnâ€™t been walking through the muddy forest barefoot, that much was sure.

â€œSo there were perhaps more men? And when these died, their companions took their shoesâ€”and anything else of valueâ€â€”Fergus added practically, gesturing from the burned cabin to the stripped bodiesâ€”â€œand fled.â€

â€œAye, maybe.â€ Jamie pursed his lips, his gaze traveling slowly over the earth of the yardâ€”but the ground was churned with footsteps, clumps of grass uprooted and the whole of the yard dusted with ash and bits of charred wood. It looked as though the place had been ravaged by rampaging hippopotami.

â€œI could wish that Young Ian was here. Heâ€™s the best of the trackers; he could maybe tell what happened there, at least.â€ He nodded into the wood, where the men had been found. â€œHow many there were, maybe, and which way theyâ€™ve gone.â€

Jamie himself was no mean tracker. But the light was going fast now; even in the clearing where the burned cabin stood, the dark was rising, pooling under the trees, creeping like oil across the shattered earth.

His eyes went to the horizon, where streamers of cloud were beginning to blaze with gold and pink as the sun set behind them, and he shook his head.

â€œBury them. Then weâ€™ll go.â€

One more grim discovery remained. Alone among the dead, the burned man had not died of fire or poison. When they lifted the charred corpse from the ashes to bear him to his grave, something fell free of the body, landing with a small, heavy thunk on the ground. Brianna picked it up, and rubbed at it with the corner of her apron.

â€œI guess they overlooked this,â€ she said a little bleakly, holding it out. It was a knife, or the blade of one. The wooden hilt had burned entirely away, and the blade itself was warped with heat.

Steeling myself against the thick, acrid stench of burned fat and flesh, I bent over the corpse, poking gingerly at the midsection. Fire destroys a great deal, but preserves the strangest things. The triangular wound was quite clear, seared in the hollow beneath his ribs.

â€œThey stabbed him,â€ I said, and wiped my sweating hands on my own apron.

â€œThey killed him,â€ Bree said, watching my face. â€œAnd then his wifeâ€”â€ She glanced at the young woman on the ground, the concealing apron over her head. â€œShe made a stew with the mushrooms, and they all ate it. The children, too.â€

The clearing was silent, save for the distant calls of birds on the mountain. I could hear my own heart, beating painfully in my chest. Vengeance? Or simple despair?

â€œAye, maybe,â€ Jamie said quietly. He stooped to pick up an end of the sheet of canvas they had placed the dead man on. â€œWeâ€™ll call it accident.â€

The Dutchman and his family were laid in one grave, the two strangers in another.

A cold wind had sprung up as the sun went down; the apron fluttered away from the womanâ€™s face as they lifted her. Sinclair gave a strangled cry of shock, and nearly dropped her.

She had neither face nor hair anymore; the slender waist narrowed abruptly into charred ruin. The flesh of her head had burned away completely, leaving an oddly tiny, blackened skull, from which her teeth grinned in disconcerting levity.

They lowered her hastily into the shallow grave, her children and mother beside her, and left Brianna and me to build a small cairn over them, in the ancient Scottish way, to mark the place and provide protection from wild beasts, while a more rudimentary resting place was dug for the two barefoot men.

The work finally done, everyone gathered, white-faced and silent, around the new-made mounds. I saw Roger stand close beside Brianna, his arm protectively about her waist. A small shudder went through her, which I thought had nothing to do with the cold. Their child, Jemmy, was a year or so younger than the smallest girl.

â€œWill ye speak a word, Mac Dubh?â€ Kenny Lindsay glanced inquiringly at Jamie, pulling his knitted bonnet down over his ears against the growing chill.

It was nearly nightfall, and no one wanted to linger. We would have to make camp, somewhere well away from the stink of burning, and that would be hard enough, in the dark. But Kenny was right; we couldnâ€™t leave without at least some token of ceremony, some farewell for the strangers.

Jamie shook his head.

â€œNay, let Roger Mac speak. If these were Dutchmen, belike they were Protestant.â€

Dim as the light was, I saw the sharp glance Brianna shot at her father. It was true that Roger was a Presbyterian; so was Tom Christie, a much older man whose dour face reflected his opinion of the proceedings. The question of religion was no more than a pretext, though, and everyone knew it, including Roger.

Roger cleared his throat with a noise like tearing calico. It was always a painful sound; there was anger in it now as well. He didnâ€™t protest, though, and he met Jamieâ€™s eyes straight on, as he took his place at the head of the grave.

I had thought he would simply say the Lordâ€™s Prayer, or perhaps one of the gentler psalms. Other words came to him, though.

â€œBehold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment. He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and He hath set darkness in my paths.â€

His voice had once been powerful, and beautiful. It was choked now, no more than a rasping shadow of its former beautyâ€”but there was sufficient power in the passion with which he spoke to make all those who heard him bow their heads, faces lost in shadow.

â€œHe hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and my hope hath He removed like a tree.â€ His face was set, but his eyes rested for a bleak moment on the charred stump that had served the Dutch family for a chopping block.

â€œHe hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.â€ I saw the three Lindsay brothers exchange glances, and everyone drew a little closer together, against the rising wind.

â€œHave pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends,â€ he said, and his voice softened, so that it was difficult to hear him, above the sighing of the trees. â€œFor the hand of God has touched me.â€

Brianna made a slight movement beside him, and he cleared his throat once more, explosively, stretching his neck so that I caught a glimpse of the rope scar that marred it.

â€œOh, that my words were now written! Oh, that they were printed in a book! That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever!â€

He looked slowly round from face to face, his own expressionless, then took a deep breath to continue, voice cracking on the words.

â€œFor I know that my redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this bodyâ€â€”Brianna shuddered convulsively, and looked away from the raw mound of dirtâ€”â€œyet in my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold.â€

He stopped, and there was a brief collective sigh, as everyone let out the breath they had been holding. He wasnâ€™t quite finished, though. He had reached out, half-unconsciously, for Breeâ€™s hand, and held it tightly. He spoke the last words almost to himself, I thought, with little thought for his listeners.

â€œBe ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.â€

I shivered, and Jamieâ€™s hand curled round my own, cold but strong. He looked down at me, and I met his eyes. I knew what he was thinking.

He was thinking, as I was, not of the present, but the future. Of a small item that would appear three years hence, in the pages of the Wilmington Gazette, dated February 13, 1776.

It is with grief that the news is received of the deaths by fire of James MacKenzie Fraser and his wife, Claire Fraser, in a conflagration that destroyed their house in the settlement of Fraserâ€™s Ridge, on the night of January 21 last. Mr. Fraser, a nephew of the late Hector Cameron of River Run Plantation, was born at Broch Tuarach in Scotland. He was widely known in the Colony and deeply respected; he leaves no surviving children.

It had been easy, so far, not to think too much of it. So far in the future, and surely not an unchangeable futureâ€”after all, forewarned was forearmed . . . wasnâ€™t it?

I glanced at the shallow cairn, and a deeper chill passed through me. I stepped closer to Jamie, and put my other hand on his arm. He covered my hand with his, and squeezed tight in reassurance. No, he said to me silently. No, I will not let it happen.

As we left the desolate clearing, though, I could not free my mind of one vivid image. Not the burned cabin, the pitiful bodies, the pathetic dead garden. The image that haunted me was one I had seen some years beforeâ€”a gravestone in the ruins of Beauly Priory, high in the Scottish Highlands.

It was the tomb of a noble lady, her name surmounted by the carving of a grinning skullâ€”very like the one beneath the Dutchwomanâ€™s apron. Beneath the skull was her motto:

Hodie mihi cras tibiâ€”sic transit gloria mundi.

My turn todayâ€”yours tomorrow. Thus passes the glory of the world.

KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE




WE RETURNED TO FRASERâ€™S RIDGE just before sunset the next day, to discover a visitor waiting. Major Donald MacDonald, late of His Majestyâ€™s army, and even more lately of Governor Tryonâ€™s personal light-horse guard, was sitting on the front stoop, my cat in his lap and a jug of beer beside him.

â€œMrs. Fraser! Your servant, mum,â€ he called genially, seeing me approach. He tried to stand up, but then let out a gasp as Adso, objecting to the loss of his cozy nest, dug his claws into the Majorâ€™s thighs.

â€œDo sit, Major,â€ I said, waving him hastily back. He subsided with a grimace, but nobly refrained from flinging Adso into the bushes. I came up onto the stoop beside him and sat down, sighing with relief.

â€œMy husband is just seeing to the horses; heâ€™ll be down directly. I see that someoneâ€™s made you welcome?â€ I nodded at the beer, which he promptly offered to me with a courtly gesture, wiping the neck of the jug on his sleeve.

â€œOh, yes, mum,â€ he assured me. â€œMrs. Bug has been most assiduous of my welfare.â€

Not to seem uncordial, I accepted the beer, which in all truth went down very well. Jamie had been anxious to get back, and weâ€™d been in the saddle since dawn, with only a brief break for refreshment at midday.

â€œIt is a most excellent brew,â€ the Major said, smiling as I exhaled after swallowing, my eyes half-closing. â€œYour own making, perhaps?â€

I shook my head and took another swallow, before handing the jug back to him. â€œNo, itâ€™s Lizzieâ€™s. Lizzie Wemyss.â€

â€œOh, your bondmaid; yes, of course. Will you give her my compliments?â€

â€œIsnâ€™t she here?â€ I glanced toward the open door behind him, rather surprised. At this time of day, I would have expected Lizzie to be in the kitchen, making supper, but she would surely have heard our arrival and come out. There was no smell of cooking, now that I noticed. She wouldnâ€™t have known when to expect us, of course, but . . .

â€œMm, no. She is . . .â€ The Major knitted his brows in the effort of recall, and I wondered how full the jug had been before he got at it; there were no more than a couple of inches left now. â€œAh, yes. She went to the McGillivraysâ€™ with her father, Mrs. Bug said. To visit her affianced, I believe?â€

â€œYes, sheâ€™s engaged to Manfred McGillivray. But Mrs. Bugâ€”â€

â€œâ€”is in the springhoose,â€ he said, with a nod up the hill toward the small shed. â€œA matter of cheese, I believe she said. An omelette was most graciously proposed for my supper.â€

â€œAh . . .â€ I relaxed a bit more, the dust of the ride settling with the beer. It was wonderful to come home, though my sense of peace was uneasy, tainted by the memory of the burned cabin.

I supposed that Mrs. Bug would have told him our errand, but he made no reference to itâ€”nor to whatever had brought him up to the Ridge. Naturally not; all business would wait appropriately for Jamie. Being female, I would get impeccable courtesy and small bits of social gossip in the meantime.

I could do social gossip, but needed to be prepared for it; I hadnâ€™t a natural knack.

â€œAh . . . Your relations with my cat seem somewhat improved,â€ I hazarded. I glanced involuntarily at his head, but his wig had been expertly mended.

â€œIt is an accepted principle of politics, I believe,â€ he said, ruffling his fingers through the thick silver fur on Adsoâ€™s belly. â€œKeep your friends closeâ€”but your enemies closer.â€

â€œVery sound,â€ I said, smiling. â€œEr . . . I hope you havenâ€™t been waiting long?â€

He shrugged, intimating that any wait was irrelevantâ€”which it generally was. The mountains had their own time, and a wise man did not try to hurry them. MacDonald was a seasoned soldier, and well-traveledâ€”but he had been born in Pitlochry, close enough to the Highland peaks to know their ways.

â€œI came this morning,â€ he said. â€œFrom New Bern.â€

Small warning bells went off in the back of my mind. It would have taken him a good ten days to travel from New Bern, if he had come directlyâ€”and the state of his creased and mud-stained uniform suggested that he had.

New Bern was where the new royal governor of the colony, Josiah Martin, had taken up his residence. And for MacDonald to have said, â€œFrom New Bern,â€ rather than mentioning some later stop on his journey, made it reasonably plain to me that whatever business had impelled this visit, it had originated in New Bern. I was wary of governors.

I glanced toward the path that led to the paddock, but Jamie wasnâ€™t visible yet. Mrs. Bug was, emerging from the springhouse; I waved to her and she gestured enthusiastically in welcome, though hampered by a pail of milk in one hand, a bucket of eggs in the other, a crock of butter under one arm, and a large chunk of cheese tucked neatly underneath her chin. She negotiated the steep descent with success, and disappeared round the back of the house, toward the kitchen.

â€œOmelettes all round, it looks like,â€ I remarked, turning back to the Major. â€œDid you happen to come through Cross Creek, by chance?â€

â€œI did indeed, mum. Your husbandâ€™s aunt sends you her kind regardsâ€”and a quantity of books and newspapers, which I have brought with me.â€

I was wary of newspapers these days, tooâ€”though such events as they reported had undoubtedly taken place several weeksâ€”or monthsâ€”previously. I made appreciative noises, though, wishing Jamie would hurry up, so I could excuse myself. My hair smelled of burning and my hands still remembered the touch of cold flesh; I wanted a wash, badly.

â€œI beg your pardon?â€ I had missed something MacDonald was saying. He bent politely closer to repeat it, then jerked suddenly, eyes bulging.

â€œFrigging cat!â€

Adso, who had been doing a splendid imitation of a limp dishcloth, had sprung bolt upright in the Majorâ€™s lap, eyes glowing and tail like a bottlebrush, hissing like a teakettle as he flexed his claws hard into the Majorâ€™s legs. I hadnâ€™t time to react before he had leapt over MacDonaldâ€™s shoulder and swarmed through the open surgery window behind him, ripping the Majorâ€™s ruffle and knocking his wig askew in the process.

MacDonald was cursing freely, but I hadnâ€™t attention to spare for him. Rollo was coming up the path toward the house, wolflike and sinister in the gloaming, but acting so oddly that I was standing before conscious thought could bring me to my feet.

The dog would run a few steps toward the house, circle once or twice as though unable to decide what to do next, then run back into the wood, turn, and run again toward the house, all the while whining with agitation, tail low and wavering.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,â€ I said. â€œBloody Timmyâ€™s in the well!â€ I flew down the steps and ran for the path, barely registering the Majorâ€™s startled oath behind me.

I found Ian a few hundred yards down the path, conscious, but groggy. He was sitting on the ground, eyes closed and both hands holding his head, as though to keep the bones of his skull from coming apart. He opened his eyes as I dropped to my knees beside him, and gave me an unfocused smile.

â€œAuntie,â€ he said hoarsely. He seemed to want to say something else, but couldnâ€™t quite decide what; his mouth opened, but then simply hung that way, tongue moving thoughtfully to and fro.

â€œLook at me, Ian,â€ I said, as calmly as possible. He didâ€”that was good. It was too dark to see whether his pupils were unnaturally dilated, but even in the evening shadow of the pines that edged the trail, I could see the pallor of his face, and the dark trail of bloodstains down his shirt.

Hurried steps were coming after me down the trail; Jamie, followed closely by MacDonald.

â€œHow is it, lad?â€

Jamie gripped him by one arm, and Ian swayed very gently toward him, then dropped his hands, closed his eyes, and relaxed into Jamieâ€™s arms with a sigh.

â€œIs he bad?â€ Jamie spoke anxiously over Ianâ€™s shoulder, holding him up as I frisked him for damage. The back of his shirt was saturated with dried bloodâ€”but it was dried. The tail of his hair was stiff with it, too, and I found the head wound quickly.

â€œI donâ€™t think so. Somethingâ€™s hit him hard on the head and taken out a chunk of his scalp, butâ€”â€

â€œA tomahawk, do you think?â€

MacDonald leaned over us, intent.

â€œNo,â€ said Ian drowsily, his face muffled in Jamieâ€™s shirt. â€œA ball.â€

â€œGo away, dog,â€ Jamie said briefly to Rollo, who had stuck his nose in Ianâ€™s ear, eliciting a stifled squawk from the patient and an involuntary lifting of his shoulders.

â€œIâ€™ll have a look in the light, but it may not be too bad,â€ I said, observing this. â€œHe walked some way, after all. Letâ€™s get him up to the house.â€

The men made shift to get him up the trail, Ianâ€™s arms over their shoulders, and within minutes, had him laid facedown on the table in my surgery. Here, he told us the story of his adventures, in a disjoint fashion punctuated by small yelps as I cleaned the injury, clipped bits of clotted hair away, and put five or six stitches into his scalp.

â€œI thought I was dead,â€ Ian said, and sucked air through his teeth as I drew the coarse thread through the edges of the ragged wound. â€œChrist, Auntie Claire! I woke in the morning, though, and I wasna dead after allâ€”though I thought my head was split open, and my brains spilling down my neck.â€

â€œVery nearly was,â€ I murmured, concentrating on my work. â€œI donâ€™t think it was a bullet, though.â€

That got everyoneâ€™s attention.

â€œIâ€™m not shot?â€ Ian sounded mildly indignant. One big hand lifted, straying toward the back of his head, and I slapped it lightly away.

â€œKeep still. No, you arenâ€™t shot, no credit to you. There was a deal of dirt in the wound, and shreds of wood and tree bark. If I had to guess, one of the shots knocked a dead branch loose from a tree, and it hit you in the head when it fell.â€

â€œYouâ€™re quite sure as it wasnâ€™t a tomahawk, are ye?â€ The Major seemed disappointed, too.

I tied the final knot and clipped the thread, shaking my head.

â€œI donâ€™t believe Iâ€™ve ever seen a tomahawk wound, but I donâ€™t think so. See how jagged the edges are? And the scalpâ€™s torn badly, but I donâ€™t believe the bone is fractured.â€

â€œIt was pitch-dark, the lad said,â€ Jamie put in logically. â€œNo sensible person would fling a tomahawk into a dark wood at something he couldna see.â€ He was holding the spirit lamp for me to work by; he moved it closer, so we could see not only the ragged line of stitches, but the spreading bruise around it, revealed by the hair I had clipped off.

â€œAye, see?â€ Jamieâ€™s finger spread the remaining bristles gently apart, tracing several deep scratches that scored the bruised area. â€œYour auntieâ€™s right, Ian; yeâ€™ve been attacked by a tree.â€

Ian opened one eye a slit.

â€œHas anyone ever told ye what a comical fellow ye are, Uncle Jamie?â€

â€œNo.â€

Ian closed the eye.

â€œThatâ€™s as well, because yeâ€™re not.â€

Jamie smiled, and squeezed Ianâ€™s shoulder.

â€œFeeling a bit better then, are ye?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œAye, well, the thing is,â€ Major MacDonald interrupted, â€œthat the lad did meet with some sort of banditti, no? Had ye reason to think they might be Indians?â€

â€œNo,â€ said Ian again, but this time he opened the eye all the way. It was bloodshot. â€œThey werenâ€™t.â€

MacDonald didnâ€™t appear pleased with this answer.

â€œHow could ye be sure, lad?â€ he asked, rather sharply. â€œIf it was dark, as ye say.â€

I saw Jamie glance quizzically at the Major, but he didnâ€™t interrupt. Ian moaned a little, then heaved a sigh and answered.

â€œI smelt them,â€ he said, adding almost immediately, â€œI think Iâ€™m going to puke.â€

He raised himself on one elbow and promptly did so. This effectively put an end to any further questions, and Jamie took Major MacDonald off to the kitchen, leaving me to clean Ian up and settle him as comfortably as I could.

â€œCan you open both eyes?â€ I asked, having got him tidied and resting on his side, with a pillow under his head.

He did, blinking a little at the light. The small blue flame of the spirit lamp was reflected twice over in the darkness of his eyes, but the pupils shrank at onceâ€”and together.

â€œThatâ€™s good,â€ I said, and put down the lamp on the table. â€œLeave it, dog,â€ I said to Rollo, who was nosing at the strange smell of the lampâ€”it was burning a mix of low-grade brandy and turpentine. â€œTake hold of my fingers, Ian.â€

I held out my index fingers and he slowly wrapped a large, bony hand round each of them. I put him through the drill for neurological damage, having him squeeze, pull, push, and then concluded by listening to his heart, which was thumping along reassuringly.

â€œSlight concussion,â€ I announced, straightening up and smiling at him.

â€œOh, aye?â€ he asked, squinting up at me.

â€œIt means your head aches and you feel sick. Youâ€™ll feel better in a few days.â€

â€œI could haâ€™ told ye that,â€ he muttered, settling back.

â€œSo you could,â€ I agreed. â€œBut â€˜concussionâ€™ sounds so much more important than â€˜cracked heid,â€™ doesnâ€™t it?â€

He didnâ€™t laugh, but smiled faintly in response. â€œWill ye feed Rollo, Auntie? He wouldna leave me on the way; heâ€™ll be hungry.â€

Rollo pricked his ears at the sound of his name, and shoved his muzzle into Ianâ€™s groping hand, whining softly.

â€œHeâ€™s fine,â€ I said to the dog. â€œDonâ€™t worry. And yes,â€ I added to Ian, â€œIâ€™ll bring something. Do you think you could manage a bit of bread and milk, yourself?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said definitely. â€œA dram oâ€™ whisky, maybe?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said, just as definitely, and blew out the spirit lamp.

â€œAuntie,â€ he said, as I turned to the door.

â€œYes?â€ Iâ€™d left a single candlestick to light him, and he looked very young and pale in the wavering yellow glow.

â€œWhy dâ€™ye suppose Major MacDonald wants it to be Indians I met in the wood?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know. But I imagine Jamie does. Or will, by now.â€

SERPENT IN EDEN




BRIANNA PUSHED OPEN the door to her cabin, listening warily for the scamper of rodent feet or the dry whisper of scales across the floor. Sheâ€™d once walked in in the dark and stepped within inches of a small rattlesnake; while the snake had been nearly as startled as she was, and slithered madly away between the hearthstones, sheâ€™d learned her lesson.

There was no scuttle of fleeing mice or voles this time, but something larger had been and gone, pushing its way through the oiled skin tacked over the window. The sun was just setting, and there was enough daylight left to show her the woven-grass basket in which she kept roasted peanuts, knocked from its shelf onto the floor and the contents cracked and eaten, a litter of shells scattered over the floor.

A loud rustling noise froze her momentarily, listening. It came again, followed by a loud clang as something fell to the ground, on the other side of the back wall.

â€œYou little bastard!â€ she said. â€œYouâ€™re in my pantry!â€

Fired with righteous indignation, she seized the broom and charged into the lean-to with a banshee yell. An enormous raccoon, tranquilly munching a smoked trout, dropped its prey at sight of her, dashed between her legs, and made off like a fat banker in flight from creditors, making loud birring noises of alarm.

Nerves pulsing with adrenaline, she put aside the broom and bent to salvage what she could of the mess, cursing under her breath. Raccoons were less destructive than squirrels, who would chew and shred with hapless abandonâ€”but they had bigger appetites.

God knew how long heâ€™d been in here, she thought. Long enough to lick all the butter out of its mold, pull down a cluster of smoked fish from the raftersâ€”and how something so fat had managed the acrobatic feat required for that . . . Luckily, the honeycomb had been stored in three separate jars, and only one had been despoiled. But the root vegetables had been dumped on the floor, a fresh cheese mostly devoured, and the precious jug of maple syrup had been overturned, draining into a sticky puddle in the dirt. The sight of this loss enraged her afresh, and she squeezed the potato she had just picked up so hard that her nails sank through its skin.

â€œBloody, bloody, beastly, horrible, bloody beast!â€

â€œWho?â€ said a voice behind her. Startled, she whirled and fired the potato at the intruder, who proved to be Roger. It struck him squarely in the forehead and he staggered, clutching the door frame.

â€œOw! Christ! Ow! What the hellâ€™s going on in here?â€

â€œRaccoon,â€ she said shortly, and stepped back, letting the waning light from the door illuminate the damage.

â€œHe got the maple syrup? Bugger! Did you get the bastard?â€ Hand pressed to his forehead, Roger ducked inside the lean-to pantry, glancing about for furry bodies.

Seeing that her husband shared both her priorities and her sense of outrage soothed her somewhat.

â€œNo,â€ she said. â€œHe ran. Are you bleeding? And whereâ€™s Jem?â€

â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ he said, taking the hand gingerly from his forehead and glancing at it. â€œOw. Youâ€™ve a wicked arm, girl. Jemâ€™s at the McGillivraysâ€™. Lizzie and Mr. Wemyss took him along to celebrate Sengaâ€™s engagement.â€

â€œReally? Who did she pick?â€ Both outrage and remorse were immediately subsumed in interest. Ute McGillivray, with German thoroughness, had carefully selected partners for her son and three daughters according to her own criteriaâ€”land, money, and respectability ranking highest, with age, personal appearance, and charm coming well down the list. Not surprisingly, her children had other ideasâ€”though such was the force of Frau Uteâ€™s personality that both Inga and Hilda had married men that she approved of.

Senga, though, was her motherâ€™s daughterâ€”meaning that she possessed similarly strong opinions and a similar lack of inhibition in expressing them. For months, she had been hovering between two suitors: Heinrich Strasse, a dashing but poor young manâ€”and a Lutheran!â€”from Bethania, and Ronnie Sinclair, the cooper. A well-off man, by the standards of the Ridge, and to Ute, the fact that Ronnie was thirty years Sengaâ€™s senior was no bar.

The business of Senga McGillivrayâ€™s marriage had been a topic of intense speculation on the Ridge for the last several months, and Brianna was aware of several substantial wagers riding on the outcome.

â€œSo whoâ€™s the lucky man?â€ she repeated.

â€œMrs. Bug doesnâ€™t know, and itâ€™s driving her mad,â€ Roger replied, breaking into a grin. â€œManfred McGillivray came to fetch them yesterday morning, but Mrs. Bug hadnâ€™t come down to the Big House yet, so Lizzie left a note pinned to the back door to say where theyâ€™d goneâ€”but she didnâ€™t think to say who the fortunate bridegroom is.â€

Brianna glanced at the setting sun; the orb itself had sunk out of sight, though the blazing light through the chestnut trees still lit the dooryard, making the spring grass look deep and soft as emerald velvet.

â€œI suppose weâ€™ll have to wait â€™til tomorrow to find out,â€ she said, with some regret. The McGillivraysâ€™ place was a good five miles; it would be full dark long before they reached it, and even past the thaw, one didnâ€™t wander the mountains at night without a good reasonâ€”or at least a better reason than mere curiosity.

â€œAye. Dâ€™ye want to go up to the Big House for supper? Major MacDonaldâ€™s come.â€

â€œOh, him.â€ She considered for a moment. She would like to hear any news the Major had broughtâ€”and there was something to be said for having Mrs. Bug make supper. On the other hand, she was really in no mood to be sociable, after a grim three days, a long ride, and the desecration of her pantry.

She became aware that Roger was carefully not contributing an opinion. One arm leaning on the shelf where the dwindling stock of winter apples was spread, he idly caressed one of the fruits, a forefinger slowly stroking the round yellow cheek of it. Faint, familiar vibrations were coming off him, suggesting silently that there might be advantages to an evening at home, sans parents, acquaintancesâ€”or baby.

She smiled at Roger.

â€œHowâ€™s your poor head?â€

He glanced at her briefly, the waning rays of the sun gilding the bridge of his nose and striking a flash of green from one eye. He cleared his throat.

â€œI suppose ye might kiss it,â€ he suggested diffidently. â€œIf ye liked.â€

She obligingly rose on her tiptoes and did so, gently, brushing back the thick black hair from his brow. There was a noticeable lump, though it hadnâ€™t begun to bruise yet.

â€œIs that better?â€

â€œNot yet. Better try again. Maybe a bit lower?â€

His hands settled on the swell of her hips, drawing her in. She was nearly as tall as he was; sheâ€™d noticed before what an advantage of fit this was, but the impression struck her forcibly anew. She wriggled slightly, enjoying it, and Roger drew a deep, rasping breath.

â€œNot quite that low,â€ he said. â€œNot yet, anyway.â€

â€œPicky, picky,â€ she said tolerantly, and kissed him on the mouth. His lips were warm, but the scent of bitter ash and damp earth clung to himâ€”as it did to herâ€”and she shivered a little, drawing back.

He kept a hand lightly on her back, but leaned past her, running a finger along the edge of the shelf where the jug of maple syrup had been overturned. He ran the finger lightly along her lower lip, then his own, and bent again to kiss her, sweetness rising up between them.



â€œI CANâ€™T REMEMBER how long itâ€™s been since Iâ€™ve seen ye naked.â€

She closed one eye and looked at him skeptically.

â€œAbout three days. I guess it wasnâ€™t all that memorable.â€ It had been a great relief to shed the clothes sheâ€™d been wearing for the last three days and nights. Even naked and hastily washed, though, she still smelled dust in her hair and felt the grime of the journey between her toes.

â€œOh, well, aye. Thatâ€™s not what I mean, thoughâ€”I mean, itâ€™s been a long while since weâ€™ve made love in the daylight.â€ He lay on his side, facing her, and smiled as he passed a light hand over the deep curve of her waist and the swell of buttock. â€œYeâ€™ve no idea how lovely ye look, stark naked, wiâ€™ the sun behind you. All gold, like ye were dipped in it.â€

He closed one eye, as though the sight dazzled him. She moved, and the sun shone in his face, making the open eye glow like an emerald in the split second before he blinked.

â€œMmm.â€ She put out a lazy hand and drew his head in close to kiss him.

She did know what he meant. It felt strangeâ€”almost wicked, in a pleasant sort of way. Most often, they made love at night, after Jem was asleep, whispering to each other in the hearth-lit shadows, finding each other among the rustling, secret layers of quilts and nightclothes. And while Jem normally slept as though heâ€™d been poleaxed, they were always half-conscious of the small, heavy-breathing mound beneath the quilt of his trundle bed nearby.

She was oddly just as conscious of Jem now, in his absence. It felt strange to be apart from him; not constantly aware of where he was, not feeling his body as a small, very mobile extension of her own. The freedom was exhilarating, but left her feeling uneasy, as though she had misplaced something valuable.

Theyâ€™d left the door open, the better to enjoy the flood of light and air on their skins. The sun was nearly down now, though, and while the air still glowed like honey, there was a shadow of chill in it.

A sudden gust of wind rattled the hide tacked over the window and blew across the room, slamming the door and leaving them abruptly in the dark.

Brianna gasped. Roger grunted in surprise and swung off the bed, going to open the door. He flung it wide, and she gulped in the freshet of air and sunshine, only then aware that she had held her breath when the door closed, feeling momentarily entombed.

Roger seemed to feel the same. He stood in the doorway, bracing himself against the frame, letting the wind stir the dark, curling hairs of his body. His hair was still bound in a tail; he hadnâ€™t bothered undoing it, and she had a sudden desire to come behind him, untie the leather thong and run her fingers through the soft, glossy black of it, the legacy of some ancient Spaniard, shipwrecked among the Celts.

She was up and doing it before she had consciously decided to, combing tiny yellow catkins and twigs from his locks with her fingers. He shivered, from her touch or that of the wind, but his body was warm.

â€œYou have a farmerâ€™s tan,â€ she said, lifting the hair off his neck and kissing him on the bone at the base of his nape.

â€œWell, so. Am I not a farmer, then?â€ His skin twitched under her lips, like a horseâ€™s hide. His face, neck, and forearms had paled over the winter, but were still darker than the flesh of back and shouldersâ€”and a faint line still lingered round his waist, demarcating the soft buckskin color of his torso from the startling paleness of his backside.

She cupped his buttocks, enjoying the high, round solidity of them, and he breathed deeply, leaning back a little toward her, so her breasts pressed against his back and her chin rested on his shoulder, looking out.

It was still daylight, but barely. The last long shafts of the sinking sun burst through the chestnut trees, so the tender spring green of their leaves burned with cool fire, brilliant above the lengthening shadows. It was near evening, but it was spring; the birds were still at it, chattering and courting. A mockingbird sang from the forest nearby, in a medley of trills, liquid runs, and odd yowls, which she thought it must have learned from her motherâ€™s cat.

The air was growing nippy, and gooseflesh stippled her arms and thighsâ€”but Rogerâ€™s body against her own was very warm. She wrapped her arms around his waist, the fingers of one hand playing idly with the thicket of his short and curlies.

â€œWhat are you looking at?â€ she asked softly, for his eyes were fixed on the far side of the dooryard, where the trail emerged from the forest. The trailhead was dim, shadowed by a growth of dark pinesâ€”but empty.

â€œIâ€™m watching out for a snake bearing apples,â€ he said, and laughed, then cleared his throat. â€œAre ye hungry, Eve?â€ His hand came down to twine with hers.

â€œGetting there. Are you?â€ He must be starving; they had had only a hasty snack at midday.

â€œAye, I am, butâ€”â€ He broke off, hesitating, and his fingers tightened in hers. â€œYeâ€™ll think Iâ€™m mad, butâ€”would ye mind if I went to fetch wee Jem tonight, instead of waiting for the morning? Itâ€™s only, Iâ€™d feel a bit better to have him back.â€

She squeezed his hand in return, her heart lifting.

â€œWeâ€™ll both go. Itâ€™s a great idea.â€

â€œMaybe so, but itâ€™s five miles to McGillivraysâ€™, too. Itâ€™ll be long dark before weâ€™re there.â€ He was smiling, though, and his body brushed against her breasts as he turned to face her.

Something moved by her face, and she drew back sharply. A tiny caterpillar, green as the leaves on which it fed and vibrant against Rogerâ€™s dark hair, reared itself into an S-shape, looking vainly for sanctuary.

â€œWhat?â€ Roger slid his eyes sideways, trying to see what she was looking at.

â€œFound your snake. I expect heâ€™s looking for an apple, too.â€ She coaxed the tiny worm onto her finger, stepped outside, and squatted to let it crawl onto a grass blade that matched its vivid green. But the grass was in shadow. In only an instant, the sun had gone down, the forest no longer the color of life.

A thread of smoke reached her nose; chimney smoke from the Big House, but her throat closed at the smell of burning. Suddenly her uneasiness was stronger. The light was fading, night coming on. The mockingbird had fallen silent, and the forest seemed full of mystery and threat.

She rose to her feet, shoving a hand through her hair.

â€œLetâ€™s go, then.â€

â€œDo ye not want supper, first?â€ Roger looked quizzically at her, breeches in hand.

She shook her head, chill beginning to creep up her legs.

â€œNo. Letâ€™s just go.â€ Nothing seemed to matter, save to get Jem, and be together again, a family.

â€œAll right,â€ Roger said mildly, eyeing her. â€œI do think yeâ€™d best put on your fig leaf first, though. Just in case we meet an angel with a flaming sword.â€

THE SHADOWS WHICH

FIRE THROWS




I ABANDONED IAN AND ROLLO to the juggernaut of Mrs. Bugâ€™s benevolenceâ€”let Ian try telling her he didnâ€™t want bread and milkâ€”and sat down to my own belated supper: a hot, fresh omelette, featuring not only cheese, but bits of salty bacon, asparagus, and wild mushroom, flavored with spring onions.

Jamie and the Major had finished their own meals already, and sat by the fire beneath a companionable fug of tobacco smoke from the Majorâ€™s clay pipe. Evidently, Jamie had just finished telling Major MacDonald about the gruesome tragedy, for MacDonald was frowning and shaking his head in sympathy.

â€œPuir gomerels!â€ he said. â€œYeâ€™ll be thinking that it was the same banditti, perhaps, who set upon your nephew?â€

â€œI am,â€ Jamie replied. â€œI shouldna like to think there were two such bands prowling the mountains.â€ He glanced toward the window, cozily shuttered for the night, and I noticed suddenly that he had taken down his fowling piece from over the hearth and was absently wiping the spotless barrel with an oily rag. â€œDo I gather, a charaid, that yeâ€™ve heard some report of similar doings?â€

â€œThree others. At least.â€ The Majorâ€™s pipe threatened to go out, and he drew on it mightily, making the tobacco in the bowl glow and crackle sudden red.

A small qualm made me pause, a bite of mushroom warm in my mouth. The possibility that a mysterious gang of armed men might be roaming at large, attacking homesteads at random, had not occurred to me â€™til this moment.

Obviously, it had occurred to Jamie; he rose, put the fowling piece back on its hooks, touched the rifle that hung above it for reassurance, then went to the sideboard, where his dags and the case with its elegant pair of dueling pistols were kept.

MacDonald watched with approval, puffing clouds of soft blue smoke, as Jamie methodically laid out guns, shot pouches, bullet molds, patches, rods, and all the other impedimenta of his personal armory.

â€œMmphm,â€ MacDonald said. â€œA verra nice piece, that, Colonel.â€ He nodded at one of the dags, a long-barreled, elegant thing with a scroll butt and silver-gilt fittings.

Jamie gave MacDonald a narrow glance, hearing the â€œColonel,â€ but answered calmly enough.

â€œAye, itâ€™s a bonny thing. It doesna aim true at anything over two paces, though. Won it in a horse race,â€ he added, with a small apologetic gesture at the gun, lest MacDonald think him fool enough to have paid good money for it.

He checked the flint nonetheless, replaced it, and set the gun aside.

â€œWhere?â€ Jamie said casually, reaching for the bullet mold.

I had resumed chewing, but looked inquiringly at the Major myself.

â€œMind, itâ€™s only what Iâ€™ve heard,â€ MacDonald warned, taking the pipe from his mouth for a moment, then hastily putting it back for another puff. â€œA homestead some distance from Salem, burned to the ground. Folk called Zinzerâ€”Germans.â€ He sucked hard, cheeks hollowing.

â€œThat was in February, late in the month. Then three weeks later, a ferry, on the Yadkin north of Woramâ€™s Landingâ€”the house robbed, and the ferryman killed. The thirdâ€”â€ Here he broke off, puffing furiously, and cut his eyes at me, then back at Jamie.

â€œSpeak, o, friend,â€ Jamie said in Gaelic, looking resigned. â€œShe will have been seeing more dreadful things than you have, by far.â€

I nodded at this, forking up another bite of egg, and the Major coughed.

â€œAye. Well, saving your presence, mumâ€”I happened to find myself in a, er, establishment in Edenton. . . .â€

â€œA brothel?â€ I put in. â€œYes, quite. Do go on, Major.â€

He did, rather hurriedly, his face flushing dark beneath his wig.

â€œAh . . . to be sure. Well, dâ€™ye see, â€™twas one of the, er, lasses in the place, told me as sheâ€™d been stolen from her home by outlaws who set upon the place one day without warning. Sheâ€™d no but an auld grannie she lived with, and said theyâ€™d kilt the auld woman, and burned the house above her head.â€

â€œAnd who did she say had done it?â€ Jamie had turned his stool to face the hearth, and was melting lead scrap in a ladle for the bullet mold.

â€œAh, mmphm.â€ MacDonaldâ€™s flush deepened, and the smoke fumed from his pipe with such ferocity that I could barely make out his features through the curling wreaths.

It transpired, with much coughing and circumlocution, that the Major had not really believed the girl at the timeâ€”or had been too interested in availing himself of her charms to pay much attention. Putting the story down simply as one of the tales whores often told to elicit sympathy and the odd extra glass of geneva, he had not bothered to ask for further detail.

â€œBut when I heard by chance later of the other burnings . . . well, dâ€™ye see, Iâ€™ve had the luck to be charged by the Governor with keeping an ear to the ground, as it were, in the backcountry, for signs of unrest. And I began to think that this particular instance of unrest was maybe not just sae much of a coincidence as might at first appear.â€

Jamie and I exchanged glances at that, Jamieâ€™s tinged with amusement, mine with resignation. Heâ€™d bet me that MacDonaldâ€”a half-pay cavalry officer who survived by freelancingâ€”would not only survive Governor Tryonâ€™s resignation, but would succeed in worming his way promptly into some position with the new regime, now that Tryon had left to take up a superior position as governor of New York. â€œHeâ€™s a gentleman oâ€™ fortune, our Donald,â€ heâ€™d said.

The militant smell of hot lead began to permeate the room, competing with the Majorâ€™s pipe smoke, and quite overpowering the pleasantly domestic atmosphere of rising bread, cooking, dried herbs, scouring rushes, and lye soap that normally filled the kitchen.

Lead melts suddenly; one instant, a deformed bullet or a bent button sits in the ladle, whole and distinct; the next, itâ€™s gone, a tiny puddle of metal shimmering dully in its place. Jamie poured the molten lead carefully into the mold, averting his face from the fumes.

â€œWhy Indians?â€

â€œAh. Well, â€™twas what the whore in Edenton said. She said some of those who burned her house and stole her away were Indians. But as I say, at the time I paid her story little mind.â€

Jamie made a Scottish noise indicating that he took the point, but with skepticism.

â€œAnd when did ye meet this lassie, Donald, and hear her story?â€

â€œNear Christmas.â€ The Major poked at the bowl of his pipe with a stained forefinger, not looking up. â€œYe mean when was her house attacked? She didna say, but I think . . . perhaps not too long before. She was still . . . fairly, er, fresh.â€ He coughed, caught my eye, caught his breath, and coughed again, hard, going red in the face.

Jamieâ€™s mouth pressed tight, and he looked down, flipping open the mold to drop a new-made ball onto the hearth.

I put down my fork, the remnants of appetite vanished.

â€œHow?â€ I demanded. â€œHow did this young woman come to be in the brothel?â€

â€œWhy, they sold her, mum.â€ The flush still stained MacDonaldâ€™s cheeks, but he had recovered his countenance enough to look at me. â€œThe brigands. They sold her to a river trader, she said, a few days after theyâ€™d stolen her. He kept her for a bit, on his boat, but then a man came one night to do business, took a fancy to her, and bought her. He brought her as far as the coast, but I suppose heâ€™d tired of her by then. . . .â€ His words trailed off, and he stuck the pipe back into his mouth, drawing hard.

â€œI see.â€ I did, and the half of the omelette Iâ€™d eaten lay in a small hard ball in the bottom of my stomach.

â€œStill fairly fresh.â€ How long did it take, I wondered? How long would a woman last, passed from hand to casual hand, from the splintered planks of a riverboatâ€™s deck to the tattered mattress of a hired room, given only what would keep her alive? It was more than possible that the brothel in Edenton had seemed a haven of sorts by the time she reached it. The thought didnâ€™t make me feel any more kindly toward MacDonald, though.

â€œDo you remember her name at least, Major?â€ I asked, with icy courtesy.

I thought I saw the edge of Jamieâ€™s mouth twitch, from the corner of my eye, but kept my stare focused on MacDonald.

He took the pipe from his mouth, exhaled a long stream of smoke, then looked up into my face, his eyes pale blue and very direct.

â€œIn truth, mum,â€ he said, â€œI just call them all Polly. Saves trouble, ken?â€

I was saved from replyâ€”or from something worseâ€”by the return of Mrs. Bug, bearing an empty bowl.

â€œThe laddieâ€™s eaten, and now heâ€™ll sleep,â€ she announced. Her sharp eyes flicked from my face to my half-empty plate. She opened her mouth, frowning, but then glanced at Jamie, and seeming to pick up some unspoken command from him, shut her mouth again, and picked up the plate with a brief â€œhmp!â€

â€œMrs. Bug,â€ said Jamie quietly. â€œWill ye awaâ€™ just now, and ask Arch to come down to me? And, if itâ€™s no troubling ye too much, the same word to Roger Mac?â€

Her small black eyes went round, then narrowed as she glanced at MacDonald, obviously suspecting that if there were mischief afoot, he was behind it.

â€œI will,â€ she said, and shaking her head with admonishment at me for my lack of appetite, she put down the dishes and went out, leaving the door on the latch.

â€œWoramâ€™s Landing,â€ Jamie said to MacDonald, resuming their conversation as though it had not been interrupted. â€œAnd Salem. And if it is the same men, Young Ian met them in the forest, a dayâ€™s travel west of here. Near enough.â€

â€œNear enough to be the same? Aye, it is.â€

â€œItâ€™s early in the spring.â€ Jamie glanced at the window as he spoke; it was dark now, and the shutters closed, but a cool breeze crept through and stirred the threads where I had strung mushrooms to dry, dark wizened shapes that swayed like tiny dancers, frozen against the pale wood.

I knew what he meant by that. The ground in the mountains was impassable during the winter; the high passes still held snow, and the lower slopes had only begun to green and blossom in the last few weeks. If there was an organized gang of marauders, they might only now be moving into the backcountry, after a winter spent lying low in the piedmont.

â€œIt is,â€ MacDonald agreed. â€œEarly enough, perhaps, to have folk on their guard. But before your men come, sirâ€”perhaps we should speak of what brought me?â€

â€œAye?â€ Jamie said, squinting carefully as he poured a glittering stream of lead. â€œOf course, Donald. I should have kent no small matter would bring ye so far. What is it?â€

MacDonald smiled like a shark; now weâ€™d come to it.

â€œYeâ€™ve done well wiâ€™ your place here, Colonel. How many families it is ye have on your land the noo?â€

â€œThirty-four,â€ Jamie said. He didnâ€™t look up, but turned out another bullet into the ashes.

â€œRoom for a few more, perhaps?â€ MacDonald was still smiling. We were surrounded by thousands of miles of wilderness; the handful of homesteads on Fraserâ€™s Ridge made scarcely a dent in itâ€”and could vanish like smoke. I thought momentarily of the Dutch cabin, and shivered, despite the fire. I could still taste the bitter, cloying smell of burned flesh, thick in the back of my throat, lurking beneath the lighter flavors of the omelette.

â€œPerhaps,â€ Jamie replied equably. â€œThe new Scottish emigrants, is it? From up past Thurso?â€

Major MacDonald and I both stared at him.

â€œHow the devil dâ€™ye ken that?â€ MacDonald demanded. â€œI heard it myself only ten days since!â€

â€œMet a man at the mill yesterday,â€ Jamie replied, picking up the ladle again. â€œA gentleman from Philadelphia, come into the mountains to collect plants. Heâ€™d come up from Cross Creek and seen them.â€ A muscle near his mouth twitched. â€œApparently, they made a bit of a stir at Brunswick, and didna feel themselves quite welcome, so they came up the river on flatboats.â€

â€œA bit of a stir? What did they do?â€ I asked.

â€œWell, dâ€™ye see, mum,â€ the Major explained, â€œthere are a great many folk come flooding off ships these days, straight from the Highlands. Whole villages, packed into the bowels of a shipâ€”and looking as though theyâ€™ve been shat out when they disembark, too. Thereâ€™s nothing for them on the coast, though, and the townsfolk are inclined to point and snigger, seeinâ€™ them in their outlandish rigâ€”so for the most part, they get straight onto a barge or a flatboat and head up the Cape Fear. Campbelton and Cross Creek at least have folk who can talk to them.â€

He grinned at me, brushing a smudge of dirt from the skirts of his uniform coat.

â€œThe folk in Brunswick willna be quite accustomed to such rawboned Highlanders, they having seen only such civilized Scotch persons as your husband and his aunt.â€

He nodded toward Jamie, who gave him a small, ironic bow in return.

â€œWell, relatively civilized,â€ I murmured. I was not ready to forgive MacDonald for the whore in Edenton. â€œButâ€”â€

â€œTheyâ€™ve barely a word of English among them, from what I hear,â€ MacDonald hurried on. â€œFarquard Campbell came down to speak wiâ€™ them, and brought them north to Campbelton, or I doubt not but theyâ€™d be milling about onshore yet, wiâ€™ no notion at all where to go or what to do next.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s Campbell done wiâ€™ them?â€ Jamie inquired.

â€œAh, theyâ€™re parceled out amongst his acquaintance in Campbelton, but â€™twonâ€™t suit in the long run, ye can see that, of course.â€ MacDonald shrugged. Campbelton was a small settlement near Cross Creek, centered around Farquard Campbellâ€™s successful trading store, and the land around it was entirely settledâ€”mostly by Campbells. Farquard had eight children, many of whom were also marriedâ€”and as fertile as their father.

â€œOf course,â€ Jamie said, looking wary. â€œBut theyâ€™re from the northern coast. Theyâ€™ll be fishermen, Donald, not crofters.â€

â€œAye, but theyâ€™re willing to make a change, no?â€ MacDonald gestured toward the door, and the forest beyond. â€œThereâ€™s nothing for them left in Scotland. Theyâ€™ve come here, and now they must make the best of it. A man can learn to farm, surely?â€

Jamie looked rather dubious, but MacDonald was in the full flush of his enthusiasm.

â€œIâ€™ve seen many a fisher-lad and plowboy become a soldier, man, and so have you, Iâ€™ll wager. Farmingâ€™s no more difficult than soldiering, surely?â€

Jamie smiled a little at that; he had left farming at nineteen and fought as a mercenary in France for several years before returning to Scotland.

â€œAye, well, thatâ€™s maybe true, Donald. But the thing about being a soldier is that someoneâ€™s tellinâ€™ ye what to do, from the moment ye rise until ye fall down at night. Whoâ€™s to tell these poor wee gomerels which end oâ€™ the cow to milk?â€

â€œThat would be you, I expect,â€ I said to him. I stretched myself, easing my back, stiff from riding, and glanced across at MacDonald. â€œOr at least I suppose thatâ€™s what youâ€™re getting at, Major?â€

â€œYour charm is exceeded only by your quickness of wit, mum,â€ said MacDonald, bowing gracefully in my direction. â€œAye, thatâ€™s the meat of it. All your folk are Highlanders, sir, and crofters; they can speak to these newcomers in their own tongue, show them what theyâ€™ll need to knowâ€”help them to make their way.â€

â€œThere are a good many other folk in the colony who have the Gaidhlig,â€ Jamie objected. â€œAnd most of them a great deal more convenient to Campbelton.â€

â€œAye, but youâ€™ve vacant land that needs clearing, and they havenâ€™t.â€ Obviously feeling that he had won the argument, MacDonald sat back and took up his neglected mug of beer.

Jamie looked at me, one eyebrow raised. It was perfectly true that we had vacant land: ten thousand acres, but barely twenty of them under cultivation. It was also true that lack of labor was acute in the entire colony, but even more so in the mountains, where the land didnâ€™t lend itself to tobacco or riceâ€”the sorts of crops suited to slave labor.

At the same time, thoughâ€”

â€œThe difficulty is, Donald, how to settle them.â€ Jamie bent to turn out another ball on the hearth, and straightened, brushing back a loose strand of auburn hair behind his ear. â€œIâ€™ve land, aye, but little else. Ye canna be loosing folk straight from Scotland into the wilderness, and expect them to claw a living out of it. I couldna even give them the shoon and suit of clothes a bondsman would have, let alone tools. And to feed them and all their wives and weans through the winter? To offer them protection?â€ He lifted his ladle in illustration, then shook his head and dropped in another lump of lead.

â€œAh, protection. Well, since yeâ€™ve mentioned that, let me proceed to another wee matter of interest.â€ MacDonald leaned forward, lowering his voice confidentially, though there was no one to hear.

â€œIâ€™ve said Iâ€™m the Governorâ€™s man, aye? Heâ€™s charged me to travel about, over the western part of the colony, and keep an ear to the ground. There are Regulators still unpardoned, andâ€â€”he glanced warily to and fro, as though expecting one of these persons to bound out of the fireplaceâ€”â€œyeâ€™ll have heard of the Committees of Safety?â€

â€œA bit.â€

â€œYeâ€™ll not have one established yet, here in the backcountry?â€

â€œNot that Iâ€™ve heard of, no.â€ Jamie had run out of lead to melt, and now stooped to scoop the new-made balls from the ashes at his feet, the warm light of the fire glowing red on the crown of his head. I sat down beside him on the settle, picking up the shot pouch from the table and holding it open for him.

â€œAh,â€ said MacDonald, looking pleased. â€œI see Iâ€™ve come in good time, then.â€

In the wake of the civil unrest that surrounded the War of the Regulation a year before, a number of such informal citizensâ€™ groups had sprung up, inspired by similar groups in the other colonies. If the Crown was no longer able to assure the safety of the colonists, they argued, then they must take the matter into their own hands.

The sheriffs could no longer be trusted to keep order; the scandals that had inspired the Regulator movement had assured that. The difficulty, of course, was that since the committees were self-appointed, there was no more reason to trust them than the sheriffs.

There were other committees, too. The Committees of Correspondence, loose associations of men who wrote letters to and fro, spreading news and rumor between the colonies. And it was out of these various committees that the seeds of rebellion would springâ€”were germinating even now, somewhere out in the cold spring night.

As I did now and thenâ€”and much more often, nowâ€”I reckoned up the time remaining. It was nearly April of 1773 And on the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five . . . as Longfellow so quaintly put it . . .

Two years. But war has a long fuse, and a slow match. This one had been lit at Alamance, and the bright, hot lines of the creeping fire in North Carolina were already visibleâ€”for those who knew to look.

The lead balls in the shot pouch I held rolled and clicked together; my fingers had tightened on the leather. Jamie saw it and touched my knee, quick and light, in reassurance, then took the pouch and rolled it up, tucking it into the cartridge box.

â€œGood time,â€ he repeated, looking at MacDonald. â€œWhat dâ€™ye mean by that, Donald?â€

â€œWhy, who should lead such a committee other than yourself, Colonel? I had suggested as much to the Governor.â€ MacDonald tried to look modest, and failed.

â€œVerra obliging of ye, Major,â€ Jamie said dryly. He raised an eyebrow at me. The state of the colonyâ€™s government must be worse even than he had supposed, for Governor Martin to be not only tolerating the existence of the committeesâ€”but clandestinely sanctioning them.

The long-drawn whine of a dogâ€™s yawn reached me faintly from the hall, and I excused myself, to go and check on Ian.

I wondered whether Governor Martin had the slightest idea what he was loosing. I rather thought he did, and was making the best of a bad job, by trying to ensure that some, at least, of the Committees of Safety were run by men who had backed the Crown during the War of the Regulation. The fact remained that he could not controlâ€”or even know aboutâ€”many such committees. But the colony was beginning to seethe and bump like a teakettle on the boil, and Martin had no official troops at his command, only such irregulars as MacDonaldâ€”and the militia.

Which was why MacDonald was calling Jamie â€œColonel,â€ of course. The previous governor, William Tryon, had appointed Jamieâ€”quite against his willâ€”colonel of militia for the backcountry above the Yadkin.

â€œHmph,â€ I said to myself. Neither MacDonald nor Martin was a fool. Inviting Jamie to set up a Committee of Safety meant that he would call upon those men who had served under him in the militiaâ€”but would commit the government to nothing, in terms of paying or equipping themâ€”and the Governor would be clear of any responsibility for their actions, since a Committee of Safety was not an official body.

The danger to Jamieâ€”and all of usâ€”in accepting such a proposal, thoughâ€”that was considerable.

It was dark in the hall, with no light but the spill from the kitchen behind me, and the faint glow of the single candle in the surgery. Ian was asleep, but restless, a faint frown of discomfort wrinkling the soft skin between his brows. Rollo raised his head, thick tail swishing to and fro across the floor in greeting.

Ian didnâ€™t respond when I spoke his name, or when I set a hand on his shoulder. I shook him gently, then harder. I could see him struggling, somewhere under the layers of unconsciousness, like a man drifting in the underwater currents, yielding to the beckoning depths, then snagged by an unexpected fishhook, a stab of pain in cold-numbed flesh.

His eyes opened suddenly, dark and lost, and he stared at me in incomprehension.

â€œHallo there,â€ I said softly, relieved to see him wake. â€œWhatâ€™s your name?â€

I could see that the question made no sense to him at once, and repeated it, patiently. Awareness stirred somewhere in the depths of his dilated pupils.

â€œWho am I?â€ he said in Gaelic. He said something else, slurred, in Mohawk, and his eyelids fluttered, closing.

â€œWake up, Ian,â€ I said firmly, resuming the shaking. â€œTell me who you are.â€

His eyes opened again, and he squinted at me in confusion.

â€œTry something easier,â€ I suggested, holding up two fingers. â€œHow many fingers do you see?â€

A flicker of awareness sprang up in his eyes.

â€œDinna let Arch Bug see ye do that, Auntie,â€ he said drowsily, the hint of a smile touching his face. â€œThatâ€™s verra rude, ken.â€

Well, at least he had recognized me, as well as the â€œVâ€ sign; that was something. And he must know who he was, if he was calling me Auntie.

â€œWhatâ€™s your full name?â€ I asked again.

â€œIan James FitzGibbons Fraser Murray,â€ he said, rather crossly. â€œWhy dâ€™ye keep asking me my name?â€

â€œFitzGibbons?â€ I said. â€œWhere on earth did you get that one?â€

He groaned and put two fingers against his eyelids, wincing as he pressed gently.

â€œUncle Jamie gave it meâ€”blame him,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s for his auld godfather, he said. Murtagh FitzGibbons Fraser, he was called, but my mother didna want me named Murtagh. I think Iâ€™m going to puke again,â€ he added, taking his hand away.

In the event, he heaved and retched a bit over the basin, but didnâ€™t actually vomit, which was a good sign. I eased him back onto his side, white and clammy with sweat, and Rollo stood on his hind legs, front paws braced on the table, to lick his face, which made him giggle between groans and try feebly to push the dog away.

â€œTheirig dhachaigh, Okwaho,â€ he said. â€œTheirig dhachaighâ€ meant â€œgo home,â€ in Gaelic, and Okwaho was evidently Rolloâ€™s Mohawk name. Ian seemed to be having some difficulty choosing among the three languages in which he was fluent, but was obviously lucid, in spite of that. After I had made him answer a few more annoyingly pointless questions, I wiped his face with a damp cloth, let him rinse his mouth with well-watered wine, and tucked him in again.

â€œAuntie?â€ he said drowsily, as I was turning for the door. â€œDâ€™ye think Iâ€™ll ever see my Mam again?â€

I stopped, having no idea how to answer that. In fact, there was no need; he had dropped back into sleep with the suddenness that concussion patients often showed, and was breathing deeply before I could find any words.

AMBUSH




IAN WOKE ABRUPTLY, hand closing round his tomahawk. Or what should have been his tomahawk, but was instead a handful of breeches. For an instant, he had no notion at all where he was, and sat up straight, trying to make out shapes in the dark.

Pain shot through his head like heat lightning, making him gasp soundlessly and clutch it. Somewhere in the dark below him, Rollo gave a small, startled wuff?

Christ. The piercing smells of his auntâ€™s surgery stabbed the back of his nose, alcohol and burned wick and dried medicine leaves and the foul brews she called penny-syllin. He closed his eyes, put his forehead on his drawn-up knees, and breathed slowly through his mouth.

What had he been dreaming? Some dream of danger, something violentâ€”but no clear image came to him, only the feel of being stalked, something following him through the wood.

He had to piss, badly. Fumbling for the edge of the table he lay on, he eased himself slowly upright, squinting against the flashes of pain in his head.

Mrs. Bug had left him a pot, he remembered her saying so, but the candle had gone out and heâ€™d no mind to crawl round the floor looking for it. Faint light showed him where the door was; she had left it ajar, and a glow spread down the hall from the kitchen hearth. With that as bearing, he made his way to the window, got it open, fumbled free the shutter fastening, and stood in the flood of air from the cool spring night, eyes closed in relief as his bladder eased.

That was better, though with the relief came new awareness of the queasiness of his stomach and the throbbing in his head. He sat down, putting his arms on his knees and his head on his arms, waiting for everything to ease.

There were voices in the kitchen; he could hear them clearly, now that he paid attention.

It was Uncle Jamie and yon MacDonald, and old Arch Bug, as well, with Auntie Claire now and again putting in a word, her English voice sharp by contrast with the gruff mutter of Scots and Gaelic.

â€œWould ye care, perhaps, to be an Indian agent?â€ MacDonald was saying.

What was that? he wonderedâ€”then it came to him. Aye, of course; the Crown employed men to go out to the tribes, offer them gifts, tobacco, and knives and the like. Tell them silliness about German Geordie, as though the King was like to come and sit down by the council fires at the next Rabbit Moon and speak like a man.

He smiled grimly to think of it. The notion was plain enough; cozen the Indians to fight for the English, when fighting was needed. But why should they think it needed now? The French had yielded, retreated to their northern foothold in Canada.

Oh. He remembered belatedly what Brianna had told him about the new fighting to come. Heâ€™d not known whether to believe herâ€”perhaps she was right, though, in which case . . . he didnâ€™t want to think about it. Or about anything.

Rollo padded over to him, sat and leaned heavily against him. He leaned back, resting his head in the thick fur.

An Indian agent had come once, while he lived in Snaketown. A fat wee fellow, shifty-eyed and with a tremble in his voice. He thought the manâ€”Christ, what was his name? The Mohawk had called him Bad Sweat, and that fit; he stank as though with a mortal illnessâ€”he thought the man was not accustomed to the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka; heâ€™d not much of their speech, and plainly expected them to take his scalp at any moment, something they had thought hilariousâ€”and one or two would likely have tried it, for a joke, save that Tewaktenyonh said to treat him with respect. Ian had been pressed to interpret for him, a job heâ€™d done, though without much pleasure in it. He would much sooner think himself Mohawk than acknowledge any kinship with Bad Sweat.

Uncle Jamie, though . . . heâ€™d make a better job of it, by far. Would he do it? Ian listened to the voices with a vague sense of interest, but it was clear that Uncle Jamie would not be pressed for a decision. MacDonald might as soon get a grip on a frog in a spring, he thought, hearing his uncle elude commitment.

He sighed, put his arm around Rollo, and eased more of his weight onto the dog. He felt awful. He would have supposed he was dying, save that Auntie Claire had said heâ€™d feel poorly for several days. He was sure she would have stayed if he were dying, not gone and left him with only Rollo for company.

The shutters were still open, and cold air poured over him, chilly and soft at once, the way spring nights were. He felt Rollo raise his nose, sniffing, and utter a low, eager whine. Possum, maybe, or a raccoon.

â€œGo on, then,â€ he said, straightening up and giving the dog a small push. â€œIâ€™m fine.â€

The dog sniffed him suspiciously, and tried to lick the back of his head, where the stitches were, but left off when Ian yelped and covered them with his hands.

â€œGo, I said!â€ He cuffed the dog gently, and Rollo snorted, circled once, then sailed over his head and out through the window, hitting the ground outside with a solid thump. A frightful screech rent the air and there was the sound of scrabbling feet and heavy bodies tearing through shrubbery.

Startled voices came from the direction of the kitchen, and he heard Uncle Jamieâ€™s step in the hall, an instant before the surgery door pushed in.

â€œIan?â€ called his uncle softly. â€œWhere are ye, lad? Whatâ€™s amiss?â€

He stood up, but a sheet of blinding white came down inside his eyes and he staggered. Uncle Jamie caught him by the arm, and set him down on a stool.

â€œWhat is it, lad?â€ His vision clearing, he could see his uncle in the light from the door, rifle in one hand, his face looking concerned but humorous as he glanced toward the open window. He sniffed deeply. â€œNot a skunk, I suppose.â€

â€œAye, well, I suppose itâ€™s one thing or the other,â€ Ian said, touching his head gingerly. â€œEither Rolloâ€™s gone after a painter, or heâ€™s treed Auntieâ€™s cat.â€

â€œOh, aye. Heâ€™d fare better wiâ€™ the painter.â€ His uncle set the rifle down and went to the window. â€œShall I close the shutter, or dâ€™ye need the air, lad? Youâ€™re that bit peaked.â€

â€œI feel peaked,â€ Ian admitted. â€œAye, leave it, if ye will, Uncle.â€

â€œShall ye rest, Ian?â€

He hesitated. His stomach still lurched uneasily and he felt very much that he would like to lie down againâ€”but the surgery made him uneasy, with its strong smells and the glints here and there of tiny blades and other mysterious and painful things. Uncle Jamie seemed to guess the trouble, for he bent and got a hand under Ianâ€™s elbow.

â€œCome along, lad. Ye can sleep upstairs in a proper bed, if ye dinna mind Major MacDonald in the other.â€

â€œI dinna mind,â€ he said, â€œbut Iâ€™ll stay here, I think.â€ He gestured toward the window, not wanting to nod and bother his head again. â€œRollo will likely be back soon.â€

Uncle Jamie didnâ€™t argue with him, something he was grateful for. Women fussed. Men just got on with it.

His uncle boosted him unceremoniously back into his bed, covered him up, then began rootling about in the dark, in search of the rifle he had put down. Ian began to feel that perhaps he could do with just a wee bit of fuss, after all.

â€œCould ye get me a cup oâ€™ water, Uncle Jamie?â€

â€œEh? Oh, aye.â€

Auntie Claire had left a jug of water close to hand. There was the comfortable sound of glugging liquid, and then the rim of a pottery cup held to his mouth, his uncleâ€™s hand at his back to keep him upright. He didnâ€™t need it, but didnâ€™t object; the touch was warm and comforting. He hadnâ€™t realized how chilled he was from the night air, and shivered briefly.

â€œAll right, laddie?â€ Uncle Jamie murmured, his hand tightening on Ianâ€™s shoulder.

â€œAye, fine. Uncle Jamie?â€

â€œMphm?â€

â€œDid Auntie Claire tell ye aboutâ€”about a war? One coming, I mean. With England.â€

There was a momentâ€™s silence, his uncleâ€™s big form gone still against the light from the door.

â€œShe has,â€ he said, and took away his hand. â€œDid she tell you?â€

â€œNo, Cousin Brianna did.â€ He lay down on his side, careful of his tender head. â€œDâ€™ye believe them?â€

There was no hesitation this time.

â€œAye, I do.â€ It was said with his uncleâ€™s usual dry matter-of-factness, but something in it prickled the hairs on the back of Ianâ€™s neck.

â€œOh. Well, then.â€

The goose-down pillow was soft under his cheek, and smelled of lavender. His uncleâ€™s hand touched his head, smoothed the ruffled hair back from his face.

â€œDinna fash yourself about it, Ian,â€ he said softly. â€œThereâ€™s time, yet.â€

He picked up the gun and left. From where he lay, Ian could see across the dooryard and above the trees where they dropped from the edge of the Ridge, past the slope of Black Mountain, and on into the black sky beyond, thick with stars.

He heard the back door open, and Mrs. Bugâ€™s voice, rising high above the others.

â€œTheyâ€™re no to hame, sir,â€ she was saying, breathless. â€œAnd the hoose is dark, no fire in the hearth. Wherever might they go, this time oâ€™ night?â€

He wondered dimly who was gone, but it didnâ€™t seem to matter much. If it was trouble, Uncle Jamie would deal with it. The thought was comforting; he felt like a small boy, safe in bed, hearing his fatherâ€™s voice outside, talking to a tenant in the cold dark of a Highland dawn.

Warmth spread slowly over him beneath the quilt, and he slept.



THE MOON WAS beginning to rise when they set out, and a good thing, too, Brianna thought. Even with the big, lopsided gold orb sailing up out of a cradle of stars and shedding its borrowed radiance over the sky, the trail beneath their feet was invisible. So were their feet, drowned in the absolute black of the forest at night.

Black, but not quiet. The giant trees rustled overhead, small things squealed and snuffled in the dark, and now and then the silent flutter of a bat passed close enough to startle her, as though part of the night had suddenly come loose and taken wing under her nose.

â€œThe Ministerâ€™s Cat is an apprehensive cat?â€ Roger suggested, as she gasped and clutched at him in the wake of one such leather-winged visitation.

â€œThe Ministerâ€™s Cat is an . . . appreciative cat,â€ she replied, squeezing his hand. â€œThank you.â€ Theyâ€™d likely end up sleeping on their cloaks in front of the McGillivraysâ€™ fire, instead of cozily tucked up in their own bedâ€”but at least theyâ€™d have Jemmy.

He squeezed back, his hand bigger and stronger than hers, very reassuring in the dark.

â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ he said. â€œI want him, too. Itâ€™s a night to have your family all together, safe in one place.â€

She made a small sound in her throat, acknowledgment and appreciation, but wanted to keep up the conversation, as much to keep the sense of connection with him as because it would keep the dark at bay.

â€œThe Ministerâ€™s Cat was a very eloquent cat,â€ she said delicately. â€œAt theâ€”the funeral, I mean. For those poor people.â€

Roger snorted; she saw the brief curl of his breath, white on the air.

â€œThe Ministerâ€™s Cat was a highly embarrassed cat,â€ he said. â€œYour father!â€

She smiled, since he couldnâ€™t see her.

â€œYou did really well,â€ she said mildly.

â€œMmphm,â€ he said, with another brief snort. â€œAs for eloquence . . . if there was any, it was none of mine. All I did was quote bits of some psalmâ€”I couldna even tell ye which it was.â€

â€œIt didnâ€™t matter. Why did you pickâ€”what you said, though?â€ she asked, curious. â€œI sort of thought youâ€™d say the Lordâ€™s Prayer, or maybe the Twenty-Third Psalmâ€”everybody knows that one.â€

â€œI thought I would, too,â€ he admitted. â€œI meant to. But when I came to it . . .â€ He hesitated, and she saw in memory those raw, cold mounds, and shivered, smelling soot. He tightened his grasp on her hand, and drew her closer, tucking the hand into the crook of his elbow.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ he said gruffly. â€œIt just seemedâ€”more suitable, somehow.â€

â€œIt was,â€ she said quietly, but didnâ€™t pursue the subject, choosing instead to steer the conversation into a discussion of her latest engineering project, a hand pump to raise water from the well.

â€œIf I had something to use for pipe, I could get water into the house, easy as anything! Iâ€™ve already got most of the wood I need for a nice cistern, if I can get Ronnie to cooper it for meâ€”so we can shower with rainwater, at least. But hollowing out tree limbsâ€â€”the method employed for the small amount of piping used for the pumpâ€”â€œit would take me months to manage enough just to get from the well to the house, let alone the stream. And thereâ€™s not a chance of getting any rolled copper. Even if we could afford any, which we canâ€™t, bringing it up from Wilmington would beâ€”â€ She threw her free hand up in frustration at the monumental nature of the undertaking.

He considered that for a bit, the chuff of their shoes on the rocky trail a comforting rhythm.

â€œWell, the ancient Romans did it with concrete; the recipeâ€™s in Pliny.â€

â€œI know. But it takes a particular kind of sand, which we donâ€™t happen to have. Likewise, quicklime, which we likewise donâ€™t have. Andâ€”â€

â€œAye, but what about clay?â€ he interrupted. â€œDid ye see that plate at Hildaâ€™s wedding? The big brown and red one, with the beautiful patterns?â€

â€œYes,â€ she said. â€œWhy?â€

â€œUte McGillivray said someone from Salem brought it. I dinna recall the name, but she said he was quite the big noise in pottingâ€”or whatever ye call making dishes.â€

â€œIâ€™ll bet you any amount of money she didnâ€™t say that!â€

â€œWell, words to that effect.â€ He went on, undeterred. â€œThe point being that he made it here; it wasnâ€™t something heâ€™d brought from Germany. So thereâ€™s clay about thatâ€™s suitable for firing, eh?â€

â€œOh, I see. Hmm. Well, now, thatâ€™s an idea, isnâ€™t it?â€

It was, and an attractive one whose discussion occupied them for most of the rest of the journey.

They had come down off the Ridge and were within a quarter-mile of the McGillivraysâ€™ place when she began to have an uneasy feeling down the back of her neck. It could be only imagination; after the sights they had seen in that deserted hollow, the dark air of the wood seemed thick with threat, and she had been imagining ambush at every blind bend, tensing with the anticipation of attack.

Then she heard something crack in the trees to her rightâ€”a small dry branch breaking, in a way that neither wind nor animal would break it. Real danger had its own taste, vivid as lemon juice, by contrast with the weak lemonade of imagination.

Her hand tightened on Rogerâ€™s arm in warning, and he stopped at once.

â€œWhat?â€ he whispered, hand on his knife. â€œWhere?â€ He hadnâ€™t heard it.

Damn, why hadnâ€™t she brought her gun, or at least her own dirk? All she had was her Swiss Army knife, carried always in her pocketâ€”and what weapons the landscape offered.

She leaned into Roger, pointing, her hand close to his body to be sure he followed the direction of her gesture. Then she stooped, feeling about in the darkness for a rock, or a stick to use as a club.

â€œKeep talking,â€ she whispered.

â€œThe Ministerâ€™s Cat is a fraidy cat, is she?â€ he said, his tone one of fairly convincing teasing.

â€œThe Ministerâ€™s Cat is a ferocious cat,â€ she replied, trying to match his bantering tone, meanwhile fumbling one-handed in her pocket. Her other hand closed on a stone, and she pulled it free of the clinging dirt, cold and heavy in her palm. She rose, all her senses focused on the darkness to their right. â€œSheâ€™ll freaking disembowel anything thatâ€”â€

â€œOh, itâ€™s you,â€ said a voice in the woods behind her.

She shrieked, and Roger jerked in reflex, spun on his heel to face the threat, grabbed her and thrust her behind him, all in the same motion.

The push sent her staggering backward. She caught a heel in a hidden root in the dark, and fell, landing hard on her backside, from which position she had an excellent view of Roger in the moonlight, knife in hand, charging into the trees with an incoherent roar.

Belatedly, she registered what the voice had said, as well as the unmistakable tone of disappointment in it. A very similar voice, loud with alarm, spoke from the wood on the right.

â€œJo?â€ it said. â€œWhat? Jo, what?â€

There was a lot of thrashing and yelling going on in the woods to the left. Rogerâ€™d got his hands on someone.

â€œRoger!â€ she shouted. â€œRoger, stop! Itâ€™s the Beardsleys!â€

Sheâ€™d dropped the rock when she fell, and now got to her feet, rubbing the dirt from her hand on the side of her skirt. Her heart was still pounding, her left buttock was bruised, and her urge to laugh was tinged with a strong desire to strangle one or both of the Beardsley twins.

â€œKezzie Beardsley, come out of there!â€ she bellowed, then repeated it, even louder. Kezzieâ€™s hearing had improved after her mother had removed his chronically infected tonsils and adenoids, but he was still rather deaf.

A loud rustling in the brush yielded the slight form of Keziah Beardsley, dark-haired, white-faced, and armed with a large club, which he swung off his shoulder and tried abashedly to hide behind him when he saw her.

Meanwhile, much louder rustling and a certain amount of cursing behind her portended the emergence of Roger, gripping the scrawny neck of Josiah Beardsley, Kezzieâ€™s twin.

â€œWhat in the name of God dâ€™ye wee bastards think yeâ€™re up to?â€ Roger said, shoving Jo across to stand by his brother in a patch of moonlight. â€œDâ€™ye realize I nearly killed you?â€

There was just enough light for Brianna to make out the rather cynical expression that crossed Joâ€™s face at this, before it was erased and replaced with one of earnest apology.

â€œWeâ€™re that sorry, Mr. Mac. We heard someone coming, and thought it might be brigands.â€

â€œBrigands,â€ Brianna repeated, feeling the urge to laugh rising, but keeping it firmly in check. â€œWhere on earth did you get that word?â€

â€œOh.â€ Jo looked at his feet, hands clasped behind his back. â€œMiss Lizzie was a-readinâ€™ to us, from that book what Mr. Jamie brought. â€™Twas in there. About brigands.â€

â€œI see.â€ She glanced at Roger, who met her eye, his annoyance obviously waning into amusement, as well. â€œThe Pirate Gow,â€ she explained. â€œDefoe.â€

â€œOh, aye.â€ Roger sheathed his dirk. â€œAnd why, exactly, did ye think there might be brigands coming?â€

Kezzie, with the quirks of his erratic hearing, picked that up and answered, as earnestly as his brother, though his voice was louder and slightly flat, the result of his early deafness.

â€œWe come across Mr. Lindsay, sir, on his way home, and he did tell us what passed, up by Dutchmanâ€™s Creek. Itâ€™s true, so, what he said? They was all burned to cinders?â€

â€œThey were all dead.â€ Rogerâ€™s voice had lost any tinge of amusement. â€œWhatâ€™s that to do with you lot lurking in the woods with clubs?â€

â€œWell, you see, sir, McGillivraysâ€™ is a fine, big place, what with the cooperâ€™s shop and the new house and all, and being on a road, likeâ€”well, if I was a brigand, sir, â€™tis just the sort of place I might choose,â€ replied Jo.

â€œAnd Miss Lizzieâ€™s there, with her Pap. And your son, Mr. Mac,â€ Kezzie added pointedly. â€œShouldnâ€™t want no harm to come to â€™em.â€

â€œI see.â€ Roger smiled a little crookedly. â€œWell, thanks to ye, then, for the kind thought. I doubt the brigands will be anywhere near, though; Dutchmanâ€™s Creek is a long way away.â€

â€œAye, sir,â€ Jo agreed. â€œBut brigands might be anywhere, mightnâ€™t they?â€

This was undeniable, and sufficiently true as to give Brianna a renewed feeling of chill in the pit of the stomach.

â€œThey might be, but they arenâ€™t,â€ Roger assured them. â€œCome along to the house with us, aye? Weâ€™re just going to collect wee Jem. Iâ€™m sure Frau Ute would give ye a bed by the fire.â€

The Beardsleys exchanged inscrutable looks. They were nearly identicalâ€”small and lithe, with thick dark hair, distinguished only by Kezzieâ€™s deafness and the round scar on Joâ€™s thumbâ€”and to see the two fine-boned faces wearing precisely the same expression was a little unnerving.

Whatever information had been exchanged by that look, it had evidently included as much consultation as was required, for Kezzie nodded slightly, deferring to his brother.

â€œAh, no, sir,â€ Josiah said politely. â€œWeâ€™ll bide, I think.â€ And with no further talk, the two of them turned and crunched off into the dark, scuffling leaves and rocks as they went.

â€œJo! Wait!â€ Brianna called after them, her hand having found something else in the bottom of her pocket.

â€œAye, maâ€™am?â€ Josiah was back, appearing by her elbow with unsettling abruptness. His twin was no stalker, but Jo was.

â€œOh! I mean, oh, there you are.â€ She took a deep breath to slow her heart, and handed him the carved whistle sheâ€™d made for Germain. â€œHere. If youâ€™re going to stand guard, this might be helpful. To call for help, if someone should come.â€

Jo Beardsley had plainly never seen a whistle before, but didnâ€™t care to admit it. He turned the little object over in his hand, trying not to stare at it.

Roger reached out, took it from him, and blew a healthy blast that shattered the night. Several birds, startled from their rest, shot out of the nearby trees, shrieking, followed closely by Kezzie Beardsley, eyes huge with amazement.

â€œBlow in that end,â€ Roger said, tapping the appropriate end of the whistle before handing it back. â€œSqueeze your lips a bit.â€

â€œMuch obliged, sir,â€ Jo murmured. His normal stoic facade had shattered with the silence, and he took the whistle with the wide-eyed look of a boy on Christmas morning, turning at once to show the prize to his twin. It struck her quite suddenly that neither boy likely ever had had a Christmas morningâ€”or any other sort of gift.

â€œIâ€™ll make another one for you,â€ she told Kezzie. â€œThen the two of you can signal back and forth. If you see any brigands,â€ she added, smiling.

â€œOh, yes, maâ€™am. Weâ€™ll do that, we surely will!â€ he assured her, scarcely glancing at her in his eagerness to examine the whistle his brother had put in his hands.

â€œBlow it three times, if ye want help,â€ Roger called after them, taking her arm.

â€œAye, sir!â€ came back from the darkness, followed by a belated faint â€œThank you, maâ€™am!â€â€”this in turn followed at once by a fusillade of puffs, gasps, and breathless rattles, punctuated by briefly successful shrill toots.

â€œLizzieâ€™s been teaching them manners, I see,â€ Roger said. â€œAs well as their letters. Dâ€™ye think theyâ€™ll ever be truly civilized, though?â€

â€œNo,â€ she said, with a trace of regret.

â€œReally?â€ She couldnâ€™t see his face in the dark, but heard the surprise in his voice. â€œI was only joking. Ye really think not?â€

â€œI doâ€”and no wonder, after the way they grew up. Did you see the way they were with that whistle? No oneâ€™s ever given them a present, or a toy.â€

â€œI suppose not. Dâ€™ye think thatâ€™s what makes boys civilized? If so, I imagine wee Jem will be a philosopher or an artist or something. Mrs. Bug spoils him rotten.â€

â€œOh, as if you donâ€™t,â€ she said tolerantly. â€œAnd Da, and Lizzie, and Mama, and everyone else in sight.â€

â€œOh, well,â€ Roger said, unembarrassed at the accusation. â€œWait â€™til he has a bit of competition. Germainâ€™s in no danger of spoiling, is he?â€ Germain, Fergus and Marsaliâ€™s eldest son, was harried by two small sisters, known to one and all as the hell-kittens, who followed their brother constantly, teasing and pestering.

She laughed, but felt a slight sense of uneasiness. The thought of another baby always made her feel as though she were perched at the top of a roller coaster, short of breath and stomach clenched, poised somewhere between excitement and terror. Particularly now, with the memory of their lovemaking still softly heavy, shifting like mercury in her belly.

Roger seemed to sense her ambivalence, for he didnâ€™t pursue the subject, but reached for her hand and held it, his own large and warm. The air was cold, the last vestiges of a winter chill lingering in the hollows.

â€œWhat about Fergus, then?â€ he asked, taking up an earlier thread of the conversation. â€œFrom what I hear, he hadnâ€™t much of a childhood, either, but he seems fairly civilized.â€

â€œMy aunt Jenny had the raising of him from the time he was ten,â€ she objected. â€œYou havenâ€™t met my aunt Jenny, but believe me, she could have civilized Adolf Hitler, if she put her mind to it. Besides, Fergus grew up in Paris, not the backwoodsâ€”even if it was in a brothel. And it sounds like it was a pretty high-class brothel, too, from what Marsali tells me.â€

â€œOh, aye? What does she tell you?â€

â€œOh, just stories that heâ€™s told her, now and then. About the clients, and the whâ€”the girls.â€

â€œCan ye not say â€˜whore,â€™ then?â€ he asked, amused. She felt the blood rise in her cheeks, and was pleased that it was dark; he teased her more when she blushed.

â€œI canâ€™t help it that I went to a Catholic school,â€ she said, defensive. â€œEarly conditioning.â€ It was true; she couldnâ€™t say certain words, save when in the grip of fury or when mentally prepared. â€œWhy can you, though? Youâ€™d think a preacherâ€™s lad would have the same problem.â€

He laughed, a little wryly.

â€œNot precisely the same problem. It was more a matter of feeling obliged to curse and carry on in front of my friends, to prove I could.â€

â€œWhat kind of carrying on?â€ she asked, scenting a story. He didnâ€™t often talk about his early life in Inverness, adopted by his great-uncle, a Presbyterian minister, but she loved hearing the small tidbits he sometimes let fall.

â€œOch. Smoking, drinking beer, and writing filthy words on the walls in the boysâ€™ toilet,â€ he said, the smile evident in his voice. â€œTipping over dustbins. Letting air out of automobile tires. Stealing sweeties from the Post Office. Quite the wee criminal I was, for a time.â€

â€œThe terror of Inverness, huh? Did you have a gang?â€ she teased.

â€œI did,â€ he said, and laughed. â€œGerry MacMillan, Bobby Cawdor, and Dougie Buchanan. I was odd man out, not only for being the preacherâ€™s lad, but for having an English father and an English name. So I was always out to show them I was a hard man. Meaning I was usually the one in most trouble.â€

â€œI had no idea you were a juvenile delinquent,â€ she said, charmed at the thought.

â€œWell, not for long,â€ he assured her wryly. â€œCome the summer I was fifteen, the Reverend signed me up on a fishing boat, and sent me to sea with the herring fleet. Couldna just say whether he did it to improve my character, keep me out of jail, or only because he couldnâ€™t stand me round the house any longer, but it did work. Ye want to meet hard men sometime, go to sea with a bunch of Gaelic fishermen.â€

â€œIâ€™ll remember that,â€ she said, trying not to giggle and producing a series of small, wet snorts instead. â€œDid your friends end up in jail, then, or did they go straight, without you to mislead them?â€

â€œDougie joined the army,â€ he said, a tinge of wistfulness in his voice. â€œGerry took over his dadâ€™s shopâ€”his dad was a tobacconist. Bobby . . . aye, well, Bobbyâ€™s dead. Drowned, that same summer, out lobstering with his cousin off Oban.â€

She leaned closer to him and squeezed his hand, her shoulder brushing his in sympathy.

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ she said, then paused. â€œOnly . . . he isnâ€™t dead, is he? Not yet. Not now.â€

Roger shook his head, and made a small sound of mingled humor and dismay.

â€œIs that a comfort?â€ she asked. â€œOr is it horrible to think about?â€

She wanted to keep him talking; he hadnâ€™t talked so much in one go since the hanging that had taken his singing voice. Being forced to speak in public made him self-conscious, and his throat tightened. His voice was still rasping, but relaxed as he was now, he wasnâ€™t choking or coughing.

â€œBoth,â€ he said, and made the sound again. â€œIâ€™ll never see him again, either way.â€ He shrugged slightly, pushing the thought away. â€œDâ€™ye think of your old friends much?â€

â€œNo, not much,â€ she said softly. The trail narrowed here, and she linked her arm in his, drawing close as they approached the last turn, which would bring them in sight of the McGillivraysâ€™. â€œThereâ€™s too much here.â€ But she didnâ€™t want to talk about what wasnâ€™t here.

â€œDo you think Jo and Kezzie are just playing?â€ she asked. â€œOr are they up to something?â€

â€œWhat should they be up to?â€ he asked, accepting her change of subject without comment. â€œI canna think theyâ€™re lying in wait to commit highway robberyâ€”not at this time of night.â€

â€œOh, I believe them about standing guard,â€ she said. â€œTheyâ€™d do anything to protect Lizzie. Onlyâ€”â€ She paused. They had come out of the forest onto the wagon road; the far verge fell away in a steep bank, looking at night like a bottomless pool of black velvetâ€”by daylight, it would be a tangled mass of fallen snags, clumps of rhododendron, redbud, and dogwood, overgrown with the snarls of ancient grapevines and creepers. The road made a switchback further on and curved back on itself, arriving gently at the McGillivraysâ€™ place, a hundred feet below.

â€œThe lights are still on,â€ she said with some surprise. The small group of buildingsâ€”the Old Place, the New Place, Ronnie Sinclairâ€™s cooperâ€™s shop, Dai Jonesâ€™s blacksmithâ€™s forge and cabinâ€”were mostly dark, but the lower windows of the McGillivraysâ€™ New Place were striped with light, leaking through the cracks of the shutters, and a bonfire in front of the house made a brilliant blot of light against the dark.

â€œKenny Lindsay,â€ Roger said matter-of-factly. â€œThe Beardsleys said theyâ€™d met him. Heâ€™ll have stopped to share the news.â€

â€œMm. Weâ€™d better be careful, then; if theyâ€™re looking out for brigands, too, they might shoot at anything that moves.â€

â€œNot tonight; itâ€™s a party, remember? What were ye saying, though, about the Beardsley boys protecting Lizzie?â€

â€œOh.â€ Her toe stubbed against some hidden obstacle, and she clutched his arm to keep from falling. â€œOof! Only that I wasnâ€™t sure who they thought they were protecting her from.â€

Roger tightened his grip on her arm in reflex.

â€œWhatever dâ€™ye mean by that?â€

â€œJust that if I were Manfred McGillivray, Iâ€™d take good care to be nice to Lizzie. Mama says the Beardsleys follow her around like dogs, but they donâ€™t. They follow her like tame wolves.â€

â€œI thought Ian said it wasnâ€™t possible to tame wolves.â€

â€œIt isnâ€™t,â€ she said tersely. â€œCome on, letâ€™s hurry, before they smoor the fire.â€



THE BIG LOG HOUSE was literally overflowing with people. Light spilled from the open door and glowed in the row of tiny arrow-slit windows that marched across the front of the house, and dark forms wove in and out of the bonfireâ€™s light. The sounds of a fiddle came to them, thin and sweet through the dark, borne on the wind with the scent of roasting meat.

â€œI suppose Sengaâ€™s truly made her choice, then,â€ Roger said, taking her arm for the final steep descent to the crossroad. â€œWho dâ€™ye bet it is? Ronnie Sinclair or the German lad?â€

â€œOh, a bet? What are the stakes? Woops!â€ She stumbled, tripping on a half-buried rock in the path, but Roger tightened his grip, keeping her upright.

â€œLoser sets the pantry to rights,â€ he suggested.

â€œDeal,â€ she said promptly. â€œI think she chose Heinrich.â€

â€œAye? Well, ye may be right,â€ he said, sounding amused. â€œBut I have to tell you, it was five to three in favor of Ronnie, last I heard. Frau Uteâ€™s a force to be reckoned with.â€

â€œShe is,â€ Brianna admitted. â€œAnd if it was Hilda or Inga, Iâ€™d say it was no contest. But Sengaâ€™s got her motherâ€™s personality; nobodyâ€™s telling her what to doâ€”not even Frau Ute.

â€œWhere did they get â€˜Senga,â€™ anyway?â€ she added. â€œThere are lots of Ingas and Hildas over toward Salem, but Iâ€™ve never heard of another Senga.â€

â€œAh, well, ye wouldnâ€™tâ€”not in Salem. Itâ€™s not a German name, kenâ€”itâ€™s Scots.â€

â€œScots?â€ she said in astonishment.

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said, the grin evident in his voice. â€œItâ€™s Agnes, spelt backward. A girl named that is bound to be contrary, donâ€™t ye think?â€

â€œYouâ€™re kidding! Agnes, spelled backward?â€

â€œI wouldna say itâ€™s common, exactly, but Iâ€™ve certainly met one or two Sengas in Scotland.â€

She laughed.

â€œDo the Scots do that with any other names?â€

â€œBack-spelling?â€ He considered. â€œWell, I did go to school with a lass named Adnil, and there was a grocerâ€™s lad who got in the messages for old ladies in the neighborhoodâ€”his nameâ€™s pronounced â€˜Kirry,â€™ but itâ€™s spelt â€˜C-i-r-e.â€™â€

She looked sharply at him, in case he was teasing, but he wasnâ€™t. She shook her head.

â€œI think Mamaâ€™s right about Scots. So yours spelled backward would beâ€”â€

â€œRegor,â€ he confirmed. â€œSounds like something from a Godzilla film, doesnâ€™t it? A giant eel, maybe, or a beetle with death-ray eyes.â€ He sounded pleased at the notion.

â€œYou thought about it, didnâ€™t you?â€ she said, laughing. â€œWhich would you rather be?â€

â€œWell, when I was a kid, I thought the beetle with the death-ray eyes would be best,â€ he admitted. â€œThen I went to sea and started hauling up the occasional Moray eel in my net. Those are not the kind of thing yeâ€™d want to meet in a dark alley, believe me.â€

â€œMore agile than Godzilla, at least,â€ she said, shuddering slightly at the recollection of the one Moray eel sheâ€™d met personally. A four-foot length of spring steel and rubber, fast as lightning and equipped with a mouthful of razors, it had come up from the hold of a fishing boat sheâ€™d watched being unloaded in a little port town called MacDuff.

She and Roger had been leaning on a low rock wall, idly watching the gulls hover in the wind, when a shout of alarm from the fishing boat just below had made them look down in time to see fishermen scrambling back from something on deck.

A dark sine wave had flashed through the silver wash of fish on deck, shot under the rail, and landed on the wet stones of the quay, where it had caused similar panic among the fishermen hosing down their gear, writhing and lashing about like a crazed high-tension cable until one rubber-booted man, gathering his self-possession, had rushed up and kicked it back into the water.

â€œWell, theyâ€™re no really bad sorts, eels,â€ Roger said judiciously, evidently recalling the same memory. â€œYe canna blame them, after all; being dragged up from the bottom of the sea without warningâ€”anyone would thrash about a bit.â€

â€œSo they would,â€ she said, thinking of themselves. She took his hand, threading her fingers between his, and found his firm, cold grip a comfort.

They were close enough now to catch snatches of laughter and talk, billowing up into the cold night with the smoke of the fire. There were children running loose; she saw two small forms dart through the legs of the crowd around the fire, black and thin-limbed as Halloween goblins.

That wasnâ€™t Jem, surely? No, he was smaller, and surely Lizzie wouldnâ€™tâ€”

â€œMej,â€ Roger said.

â€œWhat?â€

â€œJem, backward,â€ he explained. â€œI was just thinking it would be a lot of fun to see Godzilla films with him. Maybe heâ€™d like to be the beetle with death-ray eyes. Be fun, aye?â€

He sounded so wistful that a lump came to her throat, and she squeezed his hand hard, then swallowed.

â€œTell him Godzilla stories,â€ she said firmly. â€œItâ€™s make-believe anyway. Iâ€™ll draw him pictures.â€

He laughed at that.

â€œChrist, you do, and theyâ€™ll be stoning ye for trafficking with the devil, Bree. Godzilla looks like something straight out of the Book of Revelationâ€”or so I was told.â€

â€œWho told you that?â€

â€œEigger.â€

â€œWho . . . oh,â€ she said, going into mental reverse. â€œReggie? Whoâ€™s Reggie?â€

â€œThe Reverend.â€ His great-uncle, his adoptive father. There was still a smile in his voice, but one tinged with nostalgia. â€œWhen we went to the monster films together of a Saturday. Eigger and Regorâ€”and ye should have seen the looks on the faces of the Ladiesâ€™ Altar and Tea Society, when Mrs. Graham let them in without announcing them, and they came into the Reverendâ€™s study to find us stamping round and roaring, kicking hell out of a Tokyo built of blocks and soup tins.â€

She laughed, but felt tears prick at the backs of her eyes.

â€œI wish Iâ€™d known the Reverend,â€ she said, squeezing his hand.

â€œI wish ye had, too,â€ he said softly. â€œHe would have liked ye so much, Bree.â€

For the space of a few moments, while he talked, the dark forest and the flaming fire below had faded away; they were in Inverness, cozy in the Reverendâ€™s study, with rain on the windows and the sound of traffic going by in the street. It happened so often when they talked like this, between themselves. Then some small thing would fracture the momentâ€”now, it was a shout from the fire as people began to clap and singâ€”and the world of their own time vanished in an instant.

What if he were gone, she thought suddenly. Could I bring it back, all by myself?

A spasm of elemental panic gripped her, just for a moment, at the thought. Without Roger as her touchstone, with nothing but her own memories to serve as anchor to the future, that time would be lost. Would fade into hazy dreams, and be lost, leaving her no firm ground of reality to stand upon.

She took a deep breath of the cold night air, crisp with woodsmoke, and dug the balls of her feet hard into the ground as they walked, trying to feel solid.

â€œMamaMamaMAMA!â€ A small blob detached itself from the confusion round the fire and rocketed toward her, crashing into her knees with enough force to make her grab hold of Rogerâ€™s arm.

â€œJem! There you are!â€ She scooped him up and buried her face in his hair, which smelled pleasantly of goats, hay, and spicy sausage. He was heavy, and more than solid.

Then Ute McGillivray turned and saw them. Her broad face was creased in a frown, but broke into a beam of delight at seeing them. People turned at her call of greeting, and they were engulfed at once by the crowd, everyone asking questions, expressing gratified surprise at their coming.

A few questions were asked about the Dutch family, but Kenny Lindsay had brought the news of the burning earlier; Brianna was glad of that. People clucked and shook their heads, but by now they had exhausted most of their horrified speculations, and were turning to other matters. The cold of the graves beneath the fir trees still lingered as a faint chill on her heart; she had no wish to make that experience real again by talking about it.

The newly engaged couple were seated together on a pair of upturned buckets, holding hands, faces blissful in the glow of the bonfire.

â€œI win,â€ Brianna said, smiling at sight of them. â€œDonâ€™t they look happy?â€

â€œThey do,â€ Roger agreed. â€œI doubt Ronnie Sinclair is. Is he here?â€ He glanced round, and so did she, but the cooper was nowhere in sight.

â€œWaitâ€”heâ€™s in his shop,â€ she said, putting a hand on Rogerâ€™s wrist and nodding toward the small building on the opposite side of the road. There were no windows on this side of the cooperâ€™s shop, but a faint glow showed round the edge of the closed door.

Roger glanced from the darkened shop to the convivial crowd round the fire; a good many of Uteâ€™s relations had ridden over with the lucky bridegroom and his friends from Salem, bringing with them an immense barrel of black beer, which was adding to the festivities. The air was yeasty with the tang of hops.

By contrast, the cooperâ€™s shop had a desolate, glowering sort of air about it. She wondered whether anyone around the fire had yet missed Ronnie Sinclair.

â€œIâ€™ll go and have a bit of a blether with him, aye?â€ Roger touched her back in brief affection. â€œHe could maybe use a sympathetic ear.â€

â€œThat and a stiff drink?â€ She nodded toward the house, where Robin McGillivray was visible through the open door, pouring what she assumed to be whisky for a select circle of friends.

â€œI imagine he will have managed that for himself,â€ Roger replied dryly. He left her, making his way around the convivial group by the fire. He disappeared in the dark, but then she saw the door of the cooperâ€™s shop open, and Roger silhouetted briefly against the glow from within, his tall form blocking the light before vanishing inside.

â€œWanna drink, Mama!â€ Jemmy was wriggling like a tadpole, trying to get down. She set him on the ground, and he was off like a shot, nearly upsetting a stout lady with a platter of corn fritters.

The aroma of the steaming fritters reminded her that she hadnâ€™t had any supper, and she made her way after Jemmy to the table of food, where Lizzie, in her role as almost-daughter-of-the-house, helped her importantly to sauerkraut, sausages, smoked eggs, and something involving corn and squash.

â€œWhereâ€™s your sweetheart, Lizzie?â€ she asked, teasing. â€œShouldnâ€™t you be spooning with him?â€

â€œOh, him?â€ Lizzie looked like someone recalling a thing of vague general interest, but no immediate importance. â€œManfred, ye mean? Heâ€™s . . . ower there.â€ She squinted against the glow of the fire, then pointed with her serving spoon. Manfred McGillivray, her own betrothed, was with three or four other young men, all with arms linked, swaying to and fro as they sang something in German. They appeared to have trouble remembering the words, as each verse dissolved into giggles and shoving accusations.

â€œHere, SchÃ¤tzchenâ€”thatâ€™s â€˜sweetheart,â€™ ken, in German,â€ Lizzie explained, leaning down to give Jemmy a bite of sausage. He snapped the tidbit up like a starving seal and chewed industriously, then mumbled, â€œWagga gink,â€ and wandered off into the night.

â€œJem!â€ Brianna made to go after him, but was hampered by an oncoming crowd headed for the table.

â€œAh, dinna fash yourself about him,â€ Lizzie assured her. â€œEveryone kens who he is; heâ€™ll come to nay harm.â€

She might still have gone after him, save that she saw a small blond head pop up beside Jemâ€™s. Germain, Jemâ€™s bosom friend. Germain was two years older, and had a great deal more worldly knowledge than the average five-year-old, thanks in great part to his fatherâ€™s tutelage. She did hope he wasnâ€™t picking pockets in the crowd, and made a mental note to frisk him for contraband, later.

Germain had Jem firmly by the hand, so she allowed herself to be persuaded to sit down with Lizzie, Inga, and Hilda, on the bales of straw that had been placed a little way from the fire.

â€œUnd whereâ€™s your sweetheart, then?â€ teased Hilda. â€œYon big bonny black devil?â€

â€œOh, him?â€ Brianna said, mimicking Lizzie, and they all broke into rather unladylike roars of laughter; evidently the beer had been making the rounds for some time.

â€œHeâ€™s comforting Ronnie,â€ she said, with a nod toward the darkened cooperâ€™s shop. â€œIs your mother upset about Sengaâ€™s choice?â€

â€œOch, aye,â€ said Inga, rolling her eyes with great expressiveness. â€œShould haâ€™ heard them at it, her and Senga. Hammer and tongs, hammer and tongs. Da went out to the fishing, and stayed awaâ€™ three days.â€

Brianna ducked her head to hide a grin. Robin McGillivray liked a peaceful life, something he was never likely to enjoy in the company of his wife and daughters.

â€œAh, well,â€ Hilda said philosophically, leaning back a little to ease the strain of her first pregnancy, which was well advanced. â€œShe couldna really say so much, meine Mutter. Heinrichâ€™s her own cousinâ€™s son, after all. Even if he is poor.â€

â€œBut young,â€ Inga added practically. â€œDa says Heinrich will have time to get rich.â€ Ronnie Sinclair wasnâ€™t precisely richâ€”and he was thirty years older than Senga. On the other hand, he did own both his cooperâ€™s shop and half of the house in which he and the McGillivrays lived. And Ute, having shepherded both her elder daughters to solid marriages with men of property, had obviously seen the advantages of a match between Senga and Ronnie.

â€œI can see that it might be a little awkward,â€ Brianna said tactfully. â€œRonnie going on living with your family, afterâ€”â€ She nodded at the betrothed couple, who were feeding each other bits of cake.

â€œHoo!â€ Hilda exclaimed, rolling her eyes. â€œIâ€™m that glad not to be living here!â€

Inga nodded vigorous agreement, but added, â€œWell, but Mutti isna the one to be greetinâ€™ over spilt milk. Sheâ€™s got an eye out for a wife for Ronnie. Just watch her.â€ She nodded toward the food table, where Ute was chatting and smiling with a group of German women.

â€œWho dâ€™ye think it is she has picked out?â€ Inga asked her sister, eyes narrowed as she watched her mother operate. â€œThat wee Gretchen? Or your Archieâ€™s cousin, maybe? The walleyed oneâ€”Seona?â€

Hilda, married to a Scot from Surry County, shook her head at this.

â€œSheâ€™ll want a German girl,â€ she objected. â€œFor sheâ€™ll be thinkinâ€™ of what will happen if Ronnie dies, and the wife marries again. If itâ€™s a German girl, chances are Mama can bully her into a new marriage with one of her nephews or cousinsâ€”keep the property in the family, aye?â€

Brianna listened with fascination as the girls discussed the situation, with perfect matter-of-factnessâ€”and wondered whether Ronnie Sinclair had the slightest idea that his fate was being decided in this pragmatic fashion. But heâ€™d been living with the McGillivrays for more than a year, she reasoned; he must have some idea of Uteâ€™s methods.

Thanking God silently that she was not herself compelled to live in the same house with the redoubtable Frau McGillivray, she looked round for Lizzie, feeling a pang of sympathy for her erstwhile bondmaid. Lizzie would be living with Ute, once her marriage to Manfred took place next year.

Hearing the name â€œWemyss,â€ she returned to the conversation at hand, only to discover that the girls were not discussing Lizzie, but rather her father.

â€œAuntie Gertrud,â€ declared Hilda, and belched softly, fist to her mouth. â€œSheâ€™s a widow-woman herself; sheâ€™d be the best for him.â€

â€œAuntie Gertrud would have poor wee Mr. Wemyss dead in a year,â€ Inga objected, laughing. â€œSheâ€™s twice his size. If she didna kill him from exhaustion, sheâ€™d roll over in her sleep and squash him flat.â€

Hilda clapped both hands to her mouth, but less in shock than to stifle her giggles. Brianna thought sheâ€™d had her share of beer, too; her cap was awry and her pale face looked flushed, even by firelight.

â€œAye, weel, I think heâ€™s no much bothered at the thought. See him?â€ Hilda nodded past the beer-drinkers, and Brianna had no trouble picking out Mr. Wemyssâ€™s head, his hair pale and flyaway as his daughterâ€™s. He was in animated conversation with a stout woman in apron and cap, who nudged him intimately in the ribs, laughing.

As she watched, though, Ute McGillivray made her way toward them, followed by a tall blond woman, who hesitated a little, hands folded under her apron.

â€œOh, whoâ€™s that?â€ Inga craned her neck like a goose, and her sister elbowed her, scandalized.

â€œLass das, du alte Ziege! Muttiâ€™s looking this way!â€

Lizzie had half-risen to her knees, peering.

â€œWhoâ€”?â€ she said, sounding like an owl. Her attention was momentarily distracted by Manfred, who dropped beside her in the straw, grinning amiably.

â€œHow is it, then, Herzchen?â€ he said, putting an arm round her waist and trying to kiss her.

â€œWhoâ€™s that, Freddie?â€ she said, adroitly eluding his embrace and pointing discreetly toward the blond woman, who was smiling shyly as Frau Ute introduced her to Mr. Wemyss.

Manfred blinked, swaying a little on his knees, but answered readily enough.

â€œOh. Thatâ€™s Fraulein Berrisch. Pastor Berrischâ€™s sister.â€

Inga and Hilda made little cooing sounds of interest; Lizzie frowned a little, but then relaxed, seeing her father tilt back his head to address the newcomer; Fraulein Berrisch was nearly as tall as Brianna herself.

Well, that explains why sheâ€™s still a Fraulein, Brianna thought with sympathy. The womanâ€™s hair was streaked with gray, where it showed beneath her cap, and she had a rather plain face, though her eyes held a calm sweetness.

â€œOh, a Protestant, then,â€ Lizzie said, in a dismissive tone that made it clear that the Fraulein could hardly be considered as a potential mate for her father.

â€œAye, but sheâ€™s a nice woman, for aâ€™ that. Come and dance, Elizabeth.â€ Manfred had clearly lost any interest in Mr. Wemyss and the Fraulein; he pulled Lizzie, protesting, to her feet, and propelled her toward the circle of dancers. She went reluctantly, but Brianna saw that by the time they had reached the dance, Lizzie was laughing at something Manfred had said, and he was smiling down at her, the firelight glowing on the handsome planes of his face. They were a nice-looking couple, she thought, better-matched in appearance than Senga and her Heinrichâ€”who was tall, but spindly and rather hatchet-faced.

Inga and Hilda had begun arguing with each other in German, allowing Brianna to devote herself to the wholehearted consumption of the excellent supper. Hungry as she was, she would have enjoyed almost anything, but the tart, crisp sauerkraut and the sausages, bursting with juice and spices, were a rare treat.

It was only as she wiped the last of the juice and grease from her wooden plate with a chunk of corn bread that she cast a glance at the cooperâ€™s shop, thinking guiltily that she ought perhaps to have saved some for Roger. He was so kind, taking thought for poor Ronnieâ€™s feelings. She felt a rush of pride and affection for him. Maybe she should go over there and rescue him.

She had put down her plate and was sorting out her skirts and petticoats, in preparation for putting this plan into action, when she was forestalled by a pair of small figures who came weaving out of the darkness.

â€œJem?â€ she said, startled. â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€

The flames gleamed on Jemmyâ€™s hair like freshly minted copper, but the face under it was white, and his eyes enormous dark pools, fixed and staring.

â€œJemmy!â€

He turned a blank face to her, said â€œMama?â€ in a small, uncertain voice, then sat down suddenly, his legs collapsing under him like rubber bands.

She was dimly aware of Germain, swaying like a sapling in a high breeze, but had no attention to spare for him. She seized Jemmy, lifting his head and shaking him a little.

â€œJemmy! Wake up! Whatâ€™s wrong?â€

â€œThe wee laddieâ€™s dead drunk, a nighean,â€ said a voice above her, sounding amused. â€œWhatever have ye been givinâ€™ him?â€ Robin McGillivray, rather obviously a little the worse for wear himself, leaned over and prodded Jemmy gently, eliciting nothing more than a soft gurgle. He picked up one of Jemmyâ€™s arms, then let it go; it fell, boneless as a strand of boiled spaghetti.

â€œI didnâ€™t give him anything,â€ she replied, panic giving way to a rising annoyance, as she saw that Jemmy was in fact merely asleep, his small chest rising and falling with a reassuring rhythm. â€œGermain!â€

Germain had subsided into a small heap, and was singing â€œAlouetteâ€ to himself in a dreamy sort of way. Brianna had taught it to him; it was his favorite song.

â€œGermain! What did you give Jemmy to drink?â€

â€œ. . . jâ€™te plumerai la tete. . .â€

â€œGermain!â€ She grabbed him by the arm, and he ceased singing, looking surprised to see her.

â€œWhat did you give Jemmy, Germain?â€

â€œHe was thirsty, mâ€™dame,â€ Germain said, with a smile of surpassing sweetness. â€œHe wanted a drink.â€ Then his eyes rolled back in his head, and he keeled over backward, limp as a dead fish.

â€œOh, Jesus Christ on a piece of toast!â€

Inga and Hilda looked shocked, but she was in no mood to worry about their sensibilities.

â€œWhere the bloody hell is Marsali?â€

â€œSheâ€™s no here,â€ Inga said, bending forward to inspect Germain. â€œShe stopped at hame wiâ€™ the wee maedchen. Fergus is . . .â€ She straightened up, looking vaguely round. â€œWell, I saw him a while ago.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s the trouble?â€ The hoarse voice at her shoulder surprised her, and she turned to find Roger looking quizzical, his face relaxed from its usual sternness.

â€œYour son is a drunkard,â€ she informed him. Then she caught a whiff of Rogerâ€™s breath. â€œFollowing in his fatherâ€™s footsteps, I see,â€ she added coldly.

Disregarding this, Roger sat down beside her and gathered Jemmy up into his lap. Holding the little boy propped against his knees, he patted Jemmyâ€™s cheek, gently but insistently.

â€œHallo there, Mej,â€ he said softly. â€œHallo, then. Yeâ€™re all right, are ye?â€

Like magic, Jemmyâ€™s eyelids floated up. He smiled dreamily at Roger.

â€œHallo, Daddy.â€ Still smiling beatifically, his eyes closed and he relaxed into utter limpness, cheek flattened against his fatherâ€™s knee.

â€œHeâ€™s all right,â€ Roger told her.

â€œWell, good,â€ she said, not particularly mollified. â€œWhat do you think theyâ€™ve been drinking? Beer?â€

Roger leaned forward and sniffed at his offspringâ€™s red-stained lips.

â€œCherry Bounce, at a guess. Thereâ€™s a vat of it, round by the barn.â€

â€œHoly God!â€ Sheâ€™d never drunk Cherry Bounce, but Mrs. Bug had told her how to make it: â€œTakâ€™ the juice of a bushel oâ€™ cherries, dissolve twenty-four pound oâ€™ sugar ower it, then ye put it into a forty-gallon cask and fill it up wiâ€™ whisky.â€

â€œHeâ€™s all right.â€ Roger patted her arm. â€œIs that Germain over there?â€

â€œIt is.â€ She leaned over to check, but Germain was peacefully asleep, also smiling. â€œThat Cherry Bounce must be good stuff.â€

Roger laughed.

â€œItâ€™s terrible. Like industrial-strength cough syrup. I will say it makes ye very cheerful, though.â€

â€œHave you been drinking it?â€ She eyed him narrowly, but his lips appeared to be their usual color.

â€œOf course not.â€ He leaned over and kissed her, to prove it. â€œSurely ye dinna think a Scotsman like Ronnie would deal wiâ€™ disappointment by drinking Cherry Bounce? When thereâ€™s decent whisky to hand?â€

â€œTrue,â€ she said. She glanced at the cooperage. The faint glow from the hearth fire had faded and the outline of the door had disappeared, leaving the building no more than a faint rectangle of black against the darker mass of the forest beyond. â€œHow is Ronnie dealing with it?â€ She glanced round, but Inga and Hilda had taken themselves off to help Frau Ute; all of them were clustered round the food table, clearing things away.

â€œOh, heâ€™s all right, Ronnie.â€ Roger moved Jemmy off his lap, placing him gently on his side in the straw near Germain. â€œHe wasna in love with Senga, after all. Heâ€™s suffering from sexual frustration, not a broken heart.â€

â€œOh, well, if thatâ€™s all,â€ she said dryly. â€œHe wonâ€™t have to suffer much longer; Iâ€™m informed that Frau Ute has the matter well in hand.â€

â€œAye, sheâ€™s told him sheâ€™ll find him a wife. Heâ€™s what ye might call philosophical about the matter. Though still reeking wiâ€™ lust,â€ he added, wrinkling his nose.

â€œEw. Do you want anything to eat?â€ She glanced at the little boys, getting her feet under her. â€œIâ€™d better get you something before Ute and the girls clear it all away.â€

Roger yawned, suddenly and immensely.

â€œNo, Iâ€™m all right.â€ He blinked, smiling sleepily at her. â€œIâ€™ll go tell Fergus where Germain is, maybe snatch a bite on the way.â€ He patted her shoulder, then stood up, swaying only a little, and moved off toward the fire.

She checked the boys again; both were breathing deeply and regularly, dead to the world. With a sigh, she bundled them close together, piling up the straw around them, and covered them with her cloak. It was growing colder, but winter had gone; there was no feel of frost in the air.

The party was still going on, but it had shifted to a lower gear. The dancing had stopped and the crowd broken up into smaller groups, men gathered in a circle near the fire, lighting their pipes, the younger men disappeared somewhere. All around her, families were settling in for the night, making nests for themselves in the hay. Some were in the house, more in the barn; she could hear the sound of a guitar from somewhere behind the house, and a single voice, singing something slow and wistful. It made her yearn suddenly for the sound of Rogerâ€™s voice as it had been, rich and tender.

Thinking of that, though, she realized something; his voice had been much better when he came back from consoling Ronnie. Still husky and with only a shadow of its former resonanceâ€”but it had come easily, without that choked note in it. Perhaps alcohol relaxed the vocal cords?

More likely, she thought, it simply relaxed Roger; removed some of his inhibitions about the way he sounded. That was worth knowing. Her mother had opined that his voice would improve, if he would stretch it, work with it, but he was shy of using it, wary of painâ€”whether from the actual sensation of speaking, or from the contrast with the way he had sounded before.

â€œSo maybe Iâ€™ll make a little Cherry Bounce,â€ she said aloud. Then she looked at the two small forms slumbering in the hay, and contemplated the prospect of waking up alongside three hangovers, come morning. â€œWell, maybe not.â€

She bunched up enough hay for a pillow, spread her folded kerchief over itâ€”theyâ€™d be picking hay out of their clothes most of tomorrowâ€”and lay down, curling her body round Jemâ€™s. If either boy stirred or vomited in his sleep, sheâ€™d feel it and rouse.

The bonfire had burned down; only a ragged fringe of flames now flickered over the bed of glowing embers, and the lanterns set around the yard had all gone out or been thriftily extinguished. Guitar and singer had ceased. Without light and noise to keep it at bay, the night came in, spreading wings of cold silence over the mountain. The stars burned bright above, but they were pinpricks, millennia away. She closed her eyes against the immensity of the night, bowing to put her lips against Jemâ€™s head, cradling his warmth.

She tried to compose her mind for sleep, but without the distractions of company, and with the scent of burning timber strong in the air, memory stole back, and her normal prayers of blessing became pleas for mercy and protection.

â€œHe hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.â€

I wonâ€™t forget you, she said silently to the dead. It seemed so pitiful a thing to sayâ€”so small and futile. And yet the only thing in her power.

She shivered briefly, tightening her grip on Jemmy.

A sudden rustle of the hay, and Roger slid in behind her. He fumbled a bit, spreading his own cloak over her, then sighed with relief, his body relaxing heavily against hers as his arm came round her waist.

â€œBeen a bloody long day, hasnâ€™t it?â€

She groaned faintly in agreement. Now that everything was quiet, with no more need to talk, watch, pay attention, every fiber of her muscles seemed about to dissolve with fatigue. There was no more than a thin layer of hay between her and cold, hard ground, but she felt sleep lapping at her like the waves of the tide creeping up a sandy shore, soothing and inexorable.

â€œâ€˜Did you get something to eat?â€ She put a hand on his leg, and his arm tightened in reflex, holding her close.

â€œAye, if ye think beerâ€™s food. Many folk do.â€ He laughed, a warm fog of hops on his breath. â€œIâ€™m fine.â€ The warmth of his body was beginning to seep through the layers of cloth between them, dispelling the nightâ€™s chill.

Jem always gave off heat when he slept; it was like holding a clay firepot, with him curled against her. Roger was putting out even more heat, though. Well, her mother did say that an alcohol lamp burned hotter than oil.

She sighed and snuggled back against him, feeling warm, protected. The cold immensity of the night had lifted, now that she had her family close, together again, and safe.

Roger was humming. She realized it quite suddenly. There was no tune to it, but she felt the vibration of his chest against her back. She didnâ€™t want to chance stopping him; surely that was good for his vocal cords. He stopped on his own, though, after a moment. Hoping to start him again, she reached back to stroke his leg, essaying a small questioning hum of her own.

â€œHmmm-mmmm?â€

His hands cupped her buttocks and fastened tight.

â€œMmm-hmmm,â€ he said, in what sounded like a combination of invitation and satisfaction.

She didnâ€™t reply, but made a slight dissentient motion of the behind. Under normal conditions, this would have caused him to let go. He did let go, but only with one hand, and this in order to slide it down her leg, evidently meaning to get hold of her skirt and ruckle it up.

She reached back hastily and grabbed the roving hand, bringing it round and placing it on her breast, as an indication that while she appreciated the notion and under other circumstances would be thrilled to oblige, just this moment she thoughtâ€”

Roger was usually very good at reading her body language, but evidently this skill had dissolved in whisky. That, orâ€”the thought came suddenly to herâ€”he simply didnâ€™t care whether she wantedâ€”

â€œRoger!â€ she hissed.

He had started humming again, the sound now interspersed with the low, bumping noises a teakettle makes, just before the boil. Heâ€™d got his hand down her leg and up her skirt, hot on the flesh of her thigh, groping swiftly upwardâ€”and inward. Jemmy coughed, jerking in her arms, and she made an attempt to kick Roger in the shin, as a signal of discouragement.

â€œGod, youâ€™re beautiful,â€ he murmured into the curve of her neck. â€œOh, God, so beautiful. So beautiful . . . so . . . hmmm . . .â€ The next words were a mumble against her skin, but she thought heâ€™d said â€œslippery.â€ His fingers had reached their goal, and she arched her back, trying to squirm away.

â€œRoger,â€ she said, keeping her voice low. â€œRoger, there are people around!â€ And a snoring toddler wedged like a doorstop in front of her.

He mumbled something in which the words â€œdarkâ€ and â€œnobodyâ€™ll seeâ€ were distinguishable, and then the groping hand retreatedâ€”only to grab a handful of her skirts and start shoving them out of the way.

He had resumed the humming, pausing momentarily to murmur, â€œLove you, love you so much. . . .â€

â€œI love you, too,â€ she said, reaching back and trying to catch his hand. â€œRoger, stop that!â€

He did, but immediately reached around her, and grasped her by the shoulder. A quick heave, and she was lying on her back staring up at the distant stars, which were at once blotted out by Rogerâ€™s head and shoulders as he rolled on top of her in a tremendous rustling of hay and loosened clothing.

â€œJemâ€”â€ She flung out a hand toward Jemmy, who appeared not to have been disturbed by the sudden disappearance of his backstop, but was still curled up in the hay like a hibernating hedgehog.

Roger was, of all things, singing now, if one could call it that. Or chanting, at least, the words to a very bawdy Scottish song, about a miller who is pestered by a young woman wanting him to grind her corn. Whereupon he does.

â€œHe flung her down upon the sacks, and there she got her corn ground, her corn ground. . . .â€ Roger was chanting hotly in her ear, his full weight pinning her to the ground and the stars spinning madly far above.

Sheâ€™d thought his description of Ronnie as â€œreeking wiâ€™ lustâ€ merely a figure of speech, but evidently not. Bare flesh met bare flesh, and then some. She gasped. So did Roger.

â€œOh, God,â€ he said. He paused, frozen for an instant against the sky above her, then sighed in an ecstasy of whisky fumes and began to move with her, humming. It was dark, thank God, though not nearly dark enough. The remnants of the fire cast an eerie glow over his face, and he looked for an instant the bonny big, black devil Inga had called him.

Lie back and enjoy it, she thought. The hay made a tremendous rustlingâ€”but there were other rustlings nearby, and the sound of the wind soughing through the trees in the cove was nearly enough to drown them all in sibilance.

She had managed to suppress her embarrassment and was indeed beginning to enjoy it, when Roger got his hands under her, lifting.

â€œWrap your legs round me,â€ he whispered, and nipped her earlobe with his teeth. â€œWrap them round my back and hammer my arse wiâ€™ your heels.â€

Moved partly by an answering wantonness, and partly by a desire to squeeze the breath out of him like an accordion, she flung her legs apart and swung them high, scissoring them tight across his heaving back. He gave an ecstatic groan and redoubled his efforts. Wantonness was winning; she had nearly forgotten where they were.

Hanging on for dear life and thrilled by the ride, she arched her back and jerked, shuddering against the heat of him, the night windâ€™s touch cool and electric on thighs and buttocks, bared to the dark. Trembling and moaning, she melted back against the hay, her legs still locked around his hips. Boneless and nerveless, she let her head roll to the side, and slowly, languidly, opened her eyes.

Someone was there; she saw movement in the dark, and froze. It was Fergus, come to fetch his son. She heard the murmur of his voice, speaking French to Germain, and the quiet rustle of his footsteps in the hay, moving off.

She lay still, heart pounding, legs still locked in place. Roger, meanwhile, had reached his own quietus. Head hanging so that his long hair brushed her face like cobwebs in the dark, he murmured, â€œLove you . . . God, I love you,â€ and lowered himself, slowly and gently. Whereupon he breathed, â€œThank you,â€ in her ear and lapsed into warm half-consciousness on top of her, breathing heavily.

â€œOh,â€ she said, looking up to the peaceful stars. â€œDonâ€™t mention it.â€ She unlocked her stiff legs, and with some difficulty, got herself and Roger disentangled, more or less covered, and restored to blessed anonymity in their hay-lined nest, Jemmy safely stowed between them.

â€œHey,â€ she said suddenly, and Roger stirred.

â€œMm?â€

â€œWhat sort of monster was Eigger?â€

He laughed, and the sound was low and clear.

â€œOh, Eigger was a giant sponge cake. With chocolate icing. Heâ€™d fall on the other monsters, and smother them wiâ€™ sweetness.â€ He laughed again, hiccuped, and subsided in the hay.

â€œRoger?â€ she said softly, a moment later. There was no answer, and she stretched a hand across the slumbering body of her son, to rest light on Rogerâ€™s arm.

â€œSing to me,â€ she whispered, though she knew that he already was asleep.

JAMES FRASER, INDIAN AGENT




â€œJAMES FRASER, Indian Agent,â€ I said, closing one eye as though reading it off a screen. â€œIt sounds like a Wild West television show.â€

Jamie paused in the act of pulling off his stockings, and eyed me warily.

â€œIt does? Is that good?â€

â€œInsofar as the hero of a television show never dies, yes.â€

â€œIn that case, Iâ€™m in favor of it,â€ he said, examining the stocking heâ€™d just pulled off. He sniffed it suspiciously, rubbed a thumb over a thin patch on the heel, shook his head, and tossed it into the laundry basket. â€œMust I sing?â€

â€œSiâ€”oh,â€ I said, recollecting that the last time I had tried to explain television to him, my descriptions had focused largely on The Ed Sullivan Show. â€œNo, I donâ€™t think so. Nor yet swing from a trapeze.â€

â€œWell, thatâ€™s a comfort. Iâ€™m none sae young as I was, ken.â€ He stood up and stretched himself, groaning. The house had been built with eight-foot ceilings, to accommodate him, but his fists brushed the pine beams, even so. â€œChrist, but itâ€™s been a long day!â€

â€œWell, itâ€™s nearly over,â€ I said, sniffing in turn at the bodice of the gown Iâ€™d just shed. It smelled strongly, though not disagreeably, of horse and woodsmoke. Air it a bit, I decided, and see whether it could go another little while without washing. â€œI couldnâ€™t have swung on a trapeze even when I was young.â€

â€œIâ€™d pay money to see ye try,â€ he said, grinning.

â€œWhat is an Indian agent?â€ I inquired. â€œMacDonald seemed to think he was doing you a signal favor by suggesting you for the job.â€

He shrugged, unbuckling his kilt.

â€œNay doubt he thinks he is.â€ He shook the garment experimentally, and a fine sifting of dust and horsehair bloomed on the floor beneath it. He went to the window, opened the shutters, and, thrusting the kilt outside, shook it harder.

â€œHe would beâ€â€”his voice came faintly from the night outside, then more strongly, as he turned round againâ€”â€œwere it not for this war of yours.â€

â€œOf mine?â€ I said, indignant. â€œYou sound as though you think Iâ€™m proposing to start it, single-handed.â€

He made a small gesture of dismissal.

â€œYe ken what I mean. An Indian agent, Sassenach, is what it sounds likeâ€”a fellow who goes out and parleys wiâ€™ the local Indians, giving them gifts and talking them round, in hopes that theyâ€™ll be inclined to ally themselves with the Crownâ€™s interests, whatever those might happen to be.â€

â€œOh? And whatâ€™s this Southern Department that MacDonald mentioned?â€ I glanced involuntarily toward the closed door of our room, but muffled snoring from across the hall indicated that our guest had already collapsed into the arms of Morpheus.

â€œMmphm. Thereâ€™s a Southern Department and a Northern Department that deal wiâ€™ Indian affairs in the colonies. The Southern Department is under John Stuart, whoâ€™s an Inverness man. Turn round, Iâ€™ll do it.â€

I turned my back gratefully to him. With expertise born of long experience, he had the lacing of my stays undone in seconds. I sighed deeply as they loosened and fell. He plucked the shift away from my body, massaging my ribs where the boning had pressed the damp fabric into my skin.

â€œThank you.â€ I sighed in bliss and leaned back against him. â€œAnd being an Inverness man, MacDonald thinks this Stuart will have a natural predisposition to employ other Highlanders?â€

â€œThat might depend upon whether Stuartâ€™s ever met any of my kin,â€ Jamie said dryly. â€œBut MacDonald thinks so, aye.â€ He kissed the top of my head in absent affection, then withdrew his hands and began untying the lace that bound his hair.

â€œSit,â€ I said, stepping out of my fallen stays. â€œIâ€™ll do it.â€

He sat on the stool in his shirt, closing his eyes in momentary relaxation as I unbraided his hair. Heâ€™d worn it clubbed in a tight queue for riding, bound up for the last three days; I ran my hands up into the warm fiery mass as it unraveled from its plait, and the loosened waves of it spilled cinnamon and gold and silver in the firelight as I rubbed the pads of my fingers gently into his scalp.

â€œGifts, you said. Does the Crown supply these gifts?â€ The Crown, I had noticed, had a bad habit of â€œhonoringâ€ men of substance with offices that required them to come up with large amounts of their own money.

â€œTheoretically.â€ He yawned hugely, broad shoulders slumping comfortably as I took up my hair brush and set about tidying him. â€œOh, thatâ€™s nice. Thatâ€™s why MacDonald thinks it a favor; thereâ€™s the possibility of doing well in trade.â€

â€œBesides generally excellent opportunities for corruption. Yes, I see.â€ I worked for a few minutes before asking, â€œWill you do it?â€

â€œI dinna ken. I must think a bit. Ye were mentioning Wild Westâ€”Briannaâ€™s said such a thing, telling me about cowherdsâ€”â€

â€œCowboys.â€

He waved off the correction. â€œAnd the Indians. Thatâ€™s true, is itâ€”what she says about the Indians?â€

â€œIf what she says is that theyâ€™ll be largely exterminated over the next century or soâ€”yes, sheâ€™s right.â€ I smoothed his hair, then sat down on the bed facing him and set about brushing my own. â€œDoes that trouble you?â€

His brows drew together a little as he considered it, and he scratched absently at his chest, where the curly red-gold hairs showed at the open neck of his shirt.

â€œNo,â€ he said slowly. â€œNot precisely. Itâ€™s not as though I should be doing them to death wiâ€™ my own hands. But . . . weâ€™re coming to it, are we not? The time when I must tread wiâ€™ some care, if Iâ€™m to walk betwixt the fires.â€

â€œIâ€™m afraid we are,â€ I said, an uneasy tightness hovering between my shoulder blades. I saw what he meant, all too clearly. The battle lines were not clear yetâ€”but they were being drawn. To become an Indian agent for the Crown was to appear to be a Loyalistâ€”all very well for the moment, when the Rebel movement was no more than a radical fringe, with pockets of disaffection. But very, very dangerous, as we grew closer to the point where the disaffected seized power, and independence was declared.

Knowing the eventual outcome, Jamie dare not wait too long to ally himself to the Rebel sideâ€”but to do so too early was to risk arrest for treason. Not a good prospect for a man who was already a pardoned traitor.

â€œOf course,â€ I said diffidently, â€œif you were to be an Indian agent I suppose you might actually persuade some of the Indian tribes into supporting the American sideâ€”or staying neutral, at least.â€

â€œI might,â€ he agreed, with a certain note of bleakness in his voice. â€œBut putting aside any question as to the honor of such a courseâ€”that would help condemn them, no? Would the same thing happen to them in the end, dâ€™ye think, if the English were to win?â€

â€œThey wonâ€™t,â€ I said, with a slight edge.

He glanced sharply at me.

â€œI do believe ye,â€ he said, with a similar edge. â€œIâ€™ve reason to, aye?â€

I nodded, my lips pressed together. I didnâ€™t want to talk about the earlier Rising. I didnâ€™t want to talk about the oncoming Revolution, either, but there was little choice about that.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I said, and took a deep breath. â€œNo one can sayâ€”since it didnâ€™t happenâ€”but if I were to guess . . . then I think the Indians might quite possibly do better under British rule.â€ I smiled at him, a little ruefully.

â€œBelieve it or not, the British Empire didâ€”or will, I should sayâ€”generally manage to run its colonies without entirely exterminating the native people in them.â€

â€œBar the Hieland folk,â€ he said, very dryly. â€œAye, Iâ€™ll take your word for it, Sassenach.â€

He stood up, running a hand back through his hair, and I caught a glimpse of the tiny streak of white that ran through it, legacy of a bullet wound.

â€œYou should talk to Roger about it,â€ I said. â€œHe knows a great deal more than I do.â€

He nodded, but didnâ€™t reply, beyond a faint grimace.

â€œWhere do you suppose Roger and Bree went, speaking of Roger?â€

â€œTo the MacGillivraysâ€™, I suppose,â€ he replied, surprised. â€œTo fetch wee Jem.â€

â€œHow do you know that?â€ I asked, equally surprised.

â€œWhen thereâ€™s mischief abroad, a man wants his family safe under his eye, ken?â€ He raised one brow at me, and reaching to the top of the wardrobe, took down his sword. He drew it halfway from its scabbard, then put it back and set the scabbard gently back in place, the sword loosened, hilt ready to hand.

Heâ€™d brought a loaded pistol upstairs with him; that was placed on the washstand by the window. The rifle and fowling piece too had been left loaded and primed, hanging from their hooks above the hearth downstairs. And, with a small ironic flourish, he drew the dirk from its belt sheath and slid it neatly under our pillow.

â€œSometimes I forget,â€ I said a little wistfully, watching this. There had been a dirk under the pillow of our wedding couchâ€”and under many a one since then.

â€œDo ye?â€ He smiled at that; a little lopsidedly, but he smiled.

â€œDonâ€™t you? Ever?â€

He shook his head, still smiling, though it had a rueful tinge.

â€œSometimes I wish I did.â€

This colloquy was interrupted by a spluttering snort across the hall, followed at once by a thrashing of bedclothes, violent oaths, and a sharp thump! as somethingâ€”likely a shoeâ€”struck the wall.

â€œFucking cat!â€ bellowed Major MacDonald. I sat, hand pressed across my mouth, as the stomp of bare feet vibrated through the floorboards, succeeded briefly by the crash of the Majorâ€™s door, which flung open, then shut with a bang.

Jamie too had stood frozen for an instant. Now he moved, very delicately, and soundlessly eased our own door open. Adso, tail arrogantly S-shaped, strolled in. Magnificently ignoring us, he crossed the room, leapt lightly onto the washstand, and sat in the basin, where he stuck a back leg into the air and began calmly licking his testicles.

â€œI saw a man once in Paris who could do that,â€ Jamie remarked, observing this performance with interest.

â€œAre there people willing to pay to watch such things?â€ I assumed that no one was likely to engage in a public exhibition of that sort merely for the fun of it. Not in Paris, anyway.

â€œWell, it wasna the man, so much. More his female companion, who was likewise flexible.â€ He grinned at me, his eyes glinting blue in the candlelight. â€œLike watching worms mate, aye?â€

â€œHow fascinating,â€ I murmured. I glanced at the washstand, where Adso was now doing something even more indelicate. â€œYouâ€™re lucky the Major doesnâ€™t sleep armed, cat. He might have potted you like a jugged hare.â€

â€œOh, I doubt that. Our Donald likely sleeps with a bladeâ€”but he kens well enough which side of his breadâ€™s buttered. Ye wouldna be likely to give him breakfast, and heâ€™d skewered your cat.â€

I glanced toward the door. The mattress-heaving and muttered curses across the hall had died down; the Major, with the practiced ease of a professional soldier, was already well on his way back to dreamland.

â€œI suppose not. You were right about his worming his way into a position with the new governor. Which is the real reason for his desire for your political advancement, I imagine?â€

Jamie nodded, but had plainly lost interest in discussing MacDonaldâ€™s machinations.

â€œI was right, no? That means ye owe me a forfeit, Sassenach.â€

He eyed me with an air of dawning speculation, which I hoped had not been too much inspired by his memories of the wormlike Parisians.

â€œOh?â€ I regarded him warily. â€œAnd, um, what precisely . . . ?â€

â€œWell, I havena quite worked out all the details as yet, but I think ye should maybe lie on the bed, to begin with.â€

That sounded like a reasonable start to the matter. I piled up the pillows at the head of the bedâ€”pausing to remove the dirkâ€”then began to climb onto it. I paused again, though, and instead bent to wind the bedkey, tightening the ropes that supported the mattress until the bedstead groaned and the ropes gave a creaking twang.

â€œVerra canny, Sassenach,â€ Jamie said behind me, sounding amused.

â€œExperience,â€ I informed him, clambering over the newly tautened bed on hands and knees. â€œIâ€™ve waked up often enough after a night with you, with the mattress folded up round my ears and my arse no more than an inch off the ground.â€

â€œOh, I expect your arse will end up somewhat higher than that,â€ he assured me.

â€œOh, youâ€™re going to let me be on top?â€ I had mixed feelings about that. I was desperately tired, and while I enjoyed riding Jamie, all right, Iâ€™d been riding a beastly horse for more than ten hours, and the thigh muscles required for both activities were trembling spasmodically.

â€œPerhaps later,â€ he said, eyes narrowed in thought. â€œLie back, Sassenach, and ruckle up your shift. Then open your legs for me, thereâ€™s a good lass no, a bit wider, aye?â€ He beganâ€”with deliberate slownessâ€”to remove his shirt.

I sighed and shifted my buttocks a little, looking for a position that wouldnâ€™t give me cramp if I had to hold it for long.

â€œIf you have in mind what I think you have in mind, youâ€™ll regret it. I havenâ€™t even bathed properly,â€ I said reproachfully. â€œIâ€™m desperately filthy and I smell like a horse.â€

Naked, he raised one arm and sniffed appraisingly.

â€œOh? Well, so do I. Thatâ€™s no matter; Iâ€™m fond of horses.â€ Heâ€™d abandoned any pretense of delay, but paused to survey his arrangements, looking me over with approval.

â€œAye, verra good. Now then, if yeâ€™ll just put your hands above your head and seize the bedsteadâ€”â€

â€œYou wouldnâ€™t!â€ I said, and then lowered my voice, with an involuntary glance toward the door. â€œNot with MacDonald just across the hall!â€

â€œOh, I would,â€ he assured me, â€œand the devil wiâ€™ MacDonald and a dozen more like him.â€ He paused, though, studying me thoughtfully, and after a moment, sighed and shook his head.

â€œNo,â€ he said quietly. â€œNot tonight. Yeâ€™re still thinking of that poor Dutch bastard and his family, no?â€

â€œYes. Arenâ€™t you?â€

He sat down beside me on the bed with a sigh.

â€œIâ€™ve been trying verra hard not to,â€ he said frankly. â€œBut the new dead dinna lie easy in their graves, do they?â€

I laid a hand on his arm, relieved that he felt the same. The night air seemed restless with the passage of spirits, and I had felt the dragging melancholy of that desolate garden, that row of graves, all through the events and alarums of the evening.

It was a night to be securely locked inside, with a good fire on the hearth, and people nearby. The house stirred, shutters creaking in the wind.

â€œI do want ye, Claire,â€ Jamie said softly. â€œI need . . . if ye will?â€

And had they spent the night before their deaths like this, I wondered? Peaceful and snug betwixt their walls, husband and wife whispering together, lying close in their bed, having no notion what the future held. I saw in memory her long white thighs as the wind blew over her, and the glimpse Iâ€™d had of the small curly mat between them, the pudenda beneath its nimbus of brown hair pale as carved marble, the seam of it sealed like a virginâ€™s statue.

â€œI need, too,â€ I said, just as softly. â€œCome here.â€

He leaned close, and pulled the drawstring neatly from the neck of my shift, so the worn linen wilted off my shoulders. I made a grab for the fabric, but he caught my hand, and held it down by my side. One-fingered, he brushed the shift lower, then put out the candle, and in a dark that smelled of wax and honey and the sweat of horses, kissed my forehead, eyes, the corners of my cheeks, my lips and chin, and so continued, slow and soft-lipped, to the arches of my feet.

He raised himself then, and suckled my breasts for a long time, and I ran my hand up his back and cupped his buttocks, naked and vulnerable in the dark.

Afterward, we lay in a pleasantly vermiform tangle, the only light in the room a faint glow from the banked hearth. I was so tired that I could feel my body sinking into the mattress, and desired nothing more than to keep going down, down, into the welcoming dark of oblivion.

â€œSassenach?â€

â€œUm?â€

A momentâ€™s hesitation, then his hand found mine, curling round it.

â€œYe wouldna do what she did, would ye?â€

â€œWho?â€

â€œHer. The Dutchwoman.â€

Snatched back from the edge of sleep, I was muzzy and confused, sufficiently so that even the image of the dead woman, shrouded in her apron, seemed unreal, no more disturbing than the random fragments of reality my brain tossed overboard in a vain effort to keep afloat as I sank down into the depths of sleep.

â€œWhat? Fall into the fire? Iâ€™ll try not,â€ I assured him, yawning. â€œGood night.â€

â€œNo. Wake up.â€ He shook my arm gently. â€œTalk to me, Sassenach.â€

â€œNg.â€ It was a considerable effort, but I pushed away the enticing arms of Morpheus, and flounced over onto my side, facing him. â€œMm. Talk to you. About . . . ?â€

â€œThe Dutchwoman,â€ he repeated patiently. â€œIf I were to be killed, ye wouldna go and kill your whole family, would ye?â€

â€œWhat?â€ I rubbed my free hand over my face, trying to make some sense of this, amid the drifting shreds of sleep. â€œWhose wholeâ€”oh. You think she did it on purpose? Poisoned them?â€

â€œI think maybe so.â€

His words were no more than a whisper, but they brought me back to full consciousness. I lay silent for a moment, then reached out, wanting to be sure he was really there.

He was; a large, solid object, the smooth bone of his hip warm and live under my hand.

â€œIt might as well have been an accident,â€ I said, voice pitched low. â€œYou canâ€™t know for sure.â€

â€œNo,â€ he admitted. â€œBut I canna keep from seeing it.â€ He turned restlessly onto his back.

â€œThe men came,â€ he said softly, to the beams overhead. â€œHe fought them, and they killed him there, on his own threshold. And when she saw her man was gone I think she told the men she must feed the weans first, before . . . and then she put toadstools into the stew, and fed it to the bairns and her mother. She took the two men with them, but I think it was that that was the accident. She only meant to follow him. She wouldna leave him there, alone.â€

I wanted to tell him that this was a rather dramatic interpretation of what we had seen. But I couldnâ€™t very well tell him he was wrong. Hearing him describe what he saw in thought, I saw it, too, all too clearly.

â€œYou donâ€™t know,â€ I said at last, softly. â€œYou canâ€™t know.â€ Unless you find the other men, I thought suddenly, and ask them. I didnâ€™t say that, though.

Neither of us spoke for a bit. I could tell that he was still thinking, but the quicksand of sleep was once more pulling me down, clinging and seductive.

â€œWhat if I canna keep ye safe?â€ he whispered at last. His head moved suddenly on the pillow, turning toward me. â€œYou and the rest of them? I shall try wiâ€™ all my strength, Sassenach, and I dinna mind if I die doing it, but what if I should die too soonâ€”and fail?â€

And what answer was there to that?

â€œYou wonâ€™t,â€ I whispered back. He sighed, and bent his head, so his forehead rested against mine. I could smell eggs and whisky, warm on his breath.

â€œIâ€™ll try not,â€ he said, and I put my mouth on his, soft against mine, acknowledgment and comfort in the dark.

I laid my head against the curve of his shoulder, wrapped a hand round his arm, and breathed in the smell of his skin, smoke and salt, as though he had been cured in the fire.

â€œYou smell like a smoked ham,â€ I murmured, and he made a low sound of amusement and wedged his hand into its accustomed spot, clasped between my thighs.

I let go then, at last, and let the heavy sands of sleep engulf me. Perhaps he said it, as I fell into darkness, or perhaps I only dreamed it.

â€œIf I die,â€ he whispered in the dark, â€œdinna follow me. The bairns will need ye. Stay for them. I can wait.â€

VICTIM OF A MASSACRE




From Lord John Grey

To Mr. James Fraser, Esq.

April 14, 1773

My dear friendâ€”

I write you in good Health, and trust that I find you and yours in similar condition.

My Son has returned to England, there to complete his Education. He writes with Delight of his Experiences (I inclose a Copy of his most recent Letter), and assures me of his Well-being. More importantly, my Mother also writes to assure me that he flourishes, though I believeâ€”more from what she does not say than from what she doesâ€”that he introduces an unaccustomed Element of Confusion and Upheaval in her Household.

I confess to feeling the Lack of this Element in my own Household. So orderly and well-regulated a Life as mine is these Days, you would be astonished. Still, the Quiet seems oppressive to me, and while I am in Health in terms of Body, I find my Spirit somewhat flagging. I miss William sadly, I fear.

For Distraction from my solitary State, I have of late undertaken a new Employment, that of making Wine. While I admit the Product lacks the Power of your own Distillations, I flatter myself that it is not undrinkable, and if allowed to stand for a Year or two, might eventually be palatable. I shall send you a dozen Bottles later in the Month, by the Hand of my new Servant, Mr. Higgins, whose History you may find interesting.

You will perhaps have heard something of a disreputable Brawl occurring in Boston in March of three Years past, which I have often seen in Newspaper and Broadside called a â€œMassacre,â€ most irresponsiblyâ€”and most inaccurately, to one who has been privy to the actual Occurrence.

I was not present myself, but have spoken to numerous of the Officers and Soldiers who were. If they speak truly, and I believe they do, such a View as is given by the Boston Press of the Matter has been monstrous.

Boston is by all Accounts a perfect Hellhole of republican Sentiment, with so-called â€œMarching Societiesâ€ at large in the Streets in every Weather, these being no more than an Excuse for the Assembly of Mobs, whose chief Sport is the tormenting of the Troops quartered there.

Higgins tells me that no Man would dare go out alone in Uniform, for fear of these Mobs, and that even when in greater Numbers, harassment from the public soon drove them back to their Quarters, save when compelled by Duty to persist.

A Patrol of five Soldiers was so beset one Evening, pursued not only by insults of the grossest Nature, but by hurled Stones, Clods of Earth and Dung, and other such Rubbish. Such was the Press of the Mob around them that the Men feared for their Safety, and thus presented their Weapons, in hopes of discouraging the raucous Attentions rained upon them. So far from accomplishing this Aim, the Action provoked still greater Outrages from the Crowd, and at some Point, a Gun was fired. No one can say for sure whether the Shot was discharged from the Crowd, or from one of the Soldierâ€™s Weapons, let alone whether it were by Accident or in Deliberation, but the Effect of it . . . well, you will have sufficient Knowledge of such Matters to imagine the Confusion of subsequent Events.

In the End, five of the Mob were killed, and while the Soldiers were buffeted and badly handled, they escaped alive, only to be made Scapegoats by the malicious Rantings of the mobâ€™s Leaders in the Press, these so styled as to make it seem a wanton and unprovoked Slaughter of Innocents, rather than a Matter of Self-defense against a Mob inflamed by Drink and Sloganeering.

I confess that my Sympathies must lie altogether with the Soldiers; I am sure so much is obvious to you. They were brought to Trial, where the Judge discovered Three to be Innocent, but no Doubt felt it would be Dangerous to his own Situation to free them all.

Higgins, with one other, was convicted of Manslaughter, but pled Clergy and was released after his Branding. The Army of course discharged him, and without means of making a Living and subject to the Opprobrium of the Populace, he found himself in sad Case. He tells me that he was beaten in a Tavern soon after his Release, injuries inflicted therein depriving him of the Sight in one Eye, and in fact, his very Life was threatened on more than one Occasion. So seeking Safety, he took Passage on a Sloop captained by my Friend, Captain Gill, working as a Sailor, though I have seen him sail and I assure you he is not one.

This state of Affairs became soon evident to Captain Gill, who terminated his Employment upon arrival at their first Port. I was in the Town on Business, and encountered Captain Gill, who told me of Higginsâ€™s desperate Situation.

I contrived to find the Man, feeling some Pity for a Soldier who appeared to me to have performed his Duty honorably, and thinking it hard that he should suffer by it. Discovering him to be intelligent and of a generally agreeable Character, I engaged him in Service, wherein he has proved most faithful.

I send him with the Wine, in Hopes that your Wife might be so kind as to examine him. The local Physician, one Dr. Potts, has seen him, and declares the Injury to his Eye irretrievable, as indeed it may be. Having some personal Experience of your Wifeâ€™s skill, however, I wonder whether she might suggest Treatment for his other Ills; Dr. Potts was unable to be of much Help. Tell her, please, that I am her humble Servant, and remain in perpetual Gratitude for her Kindness and Ability.

My warmest Regards to your Daughter, for whom I have sent a small Present, to arrive with the Wine. I trust her Husband will not take Offense at my Familiarity, by Consideration of my long Acquaintance with your Family, and will allow her to accept it.





As always, I remain your Obâ€™t. Servant,





John Grey

THE THRESHOLD OF WAR




April 1773

ROBERT HIGGINS WAS a slight young man, so thin as to seem that his bones were barely held together by his clothes, and so pale that it was easy to imagine you could in fact see through him. He was, however, graced with large, candid blue eyes, a mass of wavy, light-brown hair, and a shy manner that caused Mrs. Bug to take him at once under her wing and declare a firm intent to â€œfeed him up,â€ before he should depart back to Virginia.

I quite liked Mr. Higgins myself; he was a sweet-natured boy, with the soft accent of his native Dorset. I did rather wonder, though, whether Lord John Greyâ€™s generosity toward him was as unselfish as it seemed.

I had come reluctantly to like John Grey, too, after our shared experience of the measles a few years earlier, and his friendship to Brianna while Roger was held captive by the Iroquois. Still, I remained acutely aware of the fact that Lord John did like menâ€”specifically, Jamie, but certainly other men, as well.

â€œBeauchamp,â€ I said to myself, laying out trillium roots to dry, â€œyou have a very suspicious mind.â€

â€œAye, ye have,â€ said a voice behind me, sounding amused. â€œWhom do ye suspect of doing what?â€

I jerked in startlement and sent trilliums flying in all directions.

â€œOh, itâ€™s you,â€ I said crossly. â€œWhy must you sneak up on me like that?â€

â€œPractice,â€ Jamie said, kissing me on the forehead. â€œI shouldna like to lose my touch at stalking game. Why dâ€™ye talk to yourself?â€

â€œIt assures me of a good listener,â€ I said tartly, and he laughed, bending to help me pick up the roots from the floor.

â€œWho are ye suspecting, Sassenach?â€

I hesitated, but was unable to come up with anything but the truth.

â€œI was wondering whether John Greyâ€™s buggering our Mr. Higgins,â€ I said baldly. â€œOr intends to.â€

He blinked slightly, but didnâ€™t look shockedâ€”which in itself suggested to me that heâ€™d considered the same possibility.

â€œWhat makes ye think so?â€

â€œHeâ€™s a very pretty young man, for the one thing,â€ I said, taking a handful of the roots from him and beginning to spread them out on a sheet of gauze. â€œAnd heâ€™s got the worst case of piles Iâ€™ve ever seen in a man of his age, for another.â€

â€œHe let ye look at them?â€ Jamie had flushed up himself at the mention of buggery; he disliked me being indelicate, but heâ€™d asked, after all.

â€œWell, it took no little persuasion,â€ I said. â€œHe told me about them readily enough, but he wasnâ€™t keen to have me examine them.â€

â€œI wouldna care for that prospect, either,â€ Jamie assured me, â€œand Iâ€™m wed to ye. Why on earth would ye want to look at such a thing, beyond morbid curiosity?â€ He cast a wary glance at my big black casebook, open on the table. â€œYeâ€™re no drawing pictures of poor Bobby Higginsâ€™s backside in there, are ye?â€

â€œNo need. I canâ€™t imagine a physician in any time who doesnâ€™t know what piles look like. The ancient Israelites and Egyptians had them, after all.â€

â€œThey did?â€

â€œItâ€™s in the Bible. Ask Mr. Christie,â€ I advised.

He gave me a sidelong look.

â€œYeâ€™ve been discussing the Bible wiâ€™ Tom Christie? Yeâ€™re a braver man than I am, Sassenach.â€ Christie was a most devout Presbyterian, and never happier than when hitting someone over the head with a fistful of Sacred Scripture.

â€œNot me. Germain asked me last week what â€˜emerodsâ€™ are.â€

â€œWhat are they?â€

â€œPiles. Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines,â€ I quoted, â€œor something of the sort. Thatâ€™s as close as I can come from memory. Mr. Christie made Germain write out a verse from the Bible as punishment, and having an inquiring sort of mind, Germain wondered what it was he was writing.â€

â€œAnd he wouldna ask Mr. Christie, of course.â€ Jamie frowned, rubbing a finger down the bridge of his nose. â€œDo I want to know what it was Germain did?â€

â€œAlmost certainly not.â€ Tom Christie earned the quitrent on his land by serving as the local schoolmaster, and seemed capable of keeping discipline on his own terms. My opinion was that having Germain Fraser as a pupil was probably worth the entire amount, in terms of labor.

â€œGold emerods,â€ Jamie murmured. â€œWell, thereâ€™s a thought.â€ He had assumed the faintly dreamy air he often had just before coming up with some hair-raising notion involving the possibility of maiming, death, or life imprisonment. I found this expression mildly alarming, but whatever the train of thought triggered by golden hemorrhoids, he abandoned it for the moment, shaking his head.

â€œWell, so. We were speaking of Bobbyâ€™s backside?â€

â€œOh, yes. As for why I wanted to look at Mr. Higginsâ€™s emerods,â€ I said, returning to the previous point of conversation, â€œI wanted to see whether the best treatment was amelioration, or removal.â€

Jamieâ€™s eyebrows went up at that.

â€œRemove them? How? Wiâ€™ your wee knife?â€ He glanced at the case where I kept my surgical tools, and hunched his shoulders in aversion.

â€œI could, yes, though I imagine it would be rather painful without anesthesia. There was a much simpler method just coming into widespread use, though, when I . . . left.â€ Just for a moment, I felt a deep twinge of longing for my hospital. I could all but smell the disinfectant, hear the murmur and bustle of nurses and orderlies, touch the glossy covers of the research journals bulging with ideas and information.

Then it was gone, and I was estimating the desirability of leeches versus string, with reference to Mr. Higginsâ€™s achieving ideal anal health.

â€œDr. Rawlings advises the use of leeches,â€ I explained. â€œTwenty or thirty, he says, for a serious case.â€

Jamie nodded, showing no particular revulsion at the idea. Of course, heâ€™d been leeched a few times himself, and assured me that it didnâ€™t hurt.

â€œAye. Ye havena got that many on hand, do ye? Shall I collect the wee lads and set them to gathering?â€

Jemmy and Germain would like nothing better than an excuse to go bogging through the creeks with their grandfather, coming back festooned with leeches and mud to the eyebrows, but I shook my head.

â€œNo. Or I mean, yes,â€ I corrected. â€œAt your convenienceâ€”but I donâ€™t need them immediately. Using leeches would relieve the situation temporarily, but Bobbyâ€™s hemorrhoids are badly thrombosedâ€”have clots of dried blood in themâ€”â€ I emended, â€œand I think he really would be better off if I remove them entirely. I believe I can ligate themâ€”tie a thread very tightly round the base of each hemorrhoid, I mean. That starves them of blood, and eventually, they just dry up and fall off. Very neat.â€

â€œVerra neat,â€ Jamie murmured, in echo. He looked mildly apprehensive. â€œHave ye done it before?â€

â€œYes, once or twice.â€

â€œAh.â€ He pursed his lips, apparently envisioning the process. â€œHow . . . er, I mean . . . can he shit, dâ€™ye think, while this is going on? It must take a bit of time, surely.â€

I frowned, tapping a finger on the countertop.

â€œHis chief difficulty is that he doesnâ€™t shit,â€ I said. â€œNot often enough, I mean, and not with the proper consistency. Horrible diet,â€ I said, pointing an accusatory finger at him. â€œHe told me. Bread, meat, and ale. No vegetables, no fruit. Constipation is absolutely rife in the British army, I donâ€™t doubt. I shouldnâ€™t be surprised if every man jack of them has piles hanging out of his arse like grape clusters!â€

Jamie nodded, one eyebrow raised.

â€œThere are a great many things I admire about ye, Sassenachâ€”especially the delicate manner of your conversation.â€ He coughed, glancing downward. â€œBut if ye say itâ€™s costiveness that causes pilesâ€”â€

â€œIt is.â€

â€œAye, well. Itâ€™s onlyâ€”what ye were saying about John Grey. I mean, ye donâ€™t think the state of Bobbyâ€™s arse is to do with . . . mmphm.â€

â€œOh. Well, no, not directly.â€ I paused. â€œIt was more that Lord John said in his letter that he wanted me toâ€”how did he put it?â€”I might suggest treatment for his other ills. I mean, he might possibly know about Bobbyâ€™s difficulty, without . . . er . . . personal inspection, shall we say? But as I say, piles are so commonplace an affliction, why ought he be concerned to the point of asking me to do something about themâ€”unless he thought that they might hamper his own eventual . . . er . . . progress?â€

Jamieâ€™s face had resumed its normal hue during the discussion of leeches and constipation, but at this point, went red again.

â€œHisâ€”â€

â€œI mean,â€ I said, folding my arms beneath my bosom, â€œIâ€™m just a trifle put off . . . by the notion that heâ€™s sent Mr. Higgins down for repair, you might say.â€ I had been suffering from a niggling feeling of unease regarding the matter of Bobby Higginsâ€™s backside, but hadnâ€™t put this notion into words before. Now that I had, I realized precisely what was bothering me.

â€œThe thought that Iâ€™m meant to be fixing up poor little Bobby, and then sending him home to beâ€”â€ I pressed my lips tight together, and turned abruptly back to my roots, needlessly turning them.

â€œI donâ€™t like the thought,â€ I said, to the cupboard door. â€œIâ€™ll do what I can for Mr. Higgins, mind. Bobby Higgins hasnâ€™t many prospects; no doubt heâ€™d do . . . whatever his Lordship required. But perhaps Iâ€™m wronging him. Lord John, I mean.â€

â€œPerhaps ye are.â€

I turned round, to find Jamie sitting on my stool, fiddling with a jar of goose grease that seemed to have his full attention.

â€œWell,â€ I said uncertainly. â€œYou know him better than I do. If you think he isnâ€™t . . .â€ My words trailed off. Outside, there was a sudden soft thump as a falling spruce cone struck the wooden stoop.

â€œI ken more about John Grey than I wish I did,â€ Jamie said finally, and glanced at me, a rueful smile in the corner of his mouth. â€œAnd he kens a great deal more about me than I like to think on. Butâ€â€”he leaned forward, setting down the jar, then put his hands on his knees and looked at meâ€”â€œI ken the one thing beyond doubt. Heâ€™s an honorable man. He wouldna take advantage of Higgins, nor any other man under his protection.â€

He sounded very definite about it, and I felt reassured. I did like John Grey. And still . . . the appearance of his letters, regular as clockwork, always gave me a faint sense of unease, like the hearing of distant thunder. There was nothing about the letters themselves to evoke such a response; they were like the man himselfâ€”erudite, humorous, and sincere. And he had reason to write, of course. More than one.

â€œHe does still love you, you know,â€ I said quietly.

He nodded, but didnâ€™t look at me, his gaze still fixed somewhere beyond the trees that edged the dooryard.

â€œWould you rather he didnâ€™t?â€

He paused, then nodded again. This time, though, he did turn to look at me.

â€œI would, aye. For myself. For him, certainly. But for William?â€ He shook his head, uncertain.

â€œOh, he may have taken William on for your sake,â€ I said, leaning back against the counter. â€œBut Iâ€™ve seen the two of them, remember. Iâ€™ve no doubt he loves Willie for his own sake now.â€

â€œNo, I dinna doubt that, either.â€ He got up, restless, and beat imaginary dust from the pleats of his kilt. His face was closed, looking inward at something he didnâ€™t wish to share with me.

â€œDo youâ€”â€ I began, but stopped when he glanced up at me. â€œNo. It doesnâ€™t matter.â€

â€œWhat?â€ He tilted his head to one side, eyes narrowing.

â€œNothing.â€

He didnâ€™t move, merely intensified the stare.

â€œI can see from your face that itâ€™s not, Sassenach. What?â€

I breathed deeply through my nose, fists wrapped in my apron.

â€œItâ€™s onlyâ€”and Iâ€™m sure it isnâ€™t true, itâ€™s only a passing thoughtâ€”â€

He made a low Scottish noise, indicating that I had better stop blethering and cough it up. Having enough experience to realize that he wouldnâ€™t leave the matter â€™til I did, I coughed.

â€œDid you ever wonder whether Lord John might have taken him because . . . well, William does look terribly like you, and evidently did from an early age. Since Lord John finds you physically . . . attractive . . .â€ The words died, and I could have cut my throat for speaking them, seeing the look on his face.

He closed his eyes for a moment, to stop me looking in. His fists were curled up so tightly that the veins stood out from knuckle to forearm. Very slowly, he relaxed his hands. He opened his eyes.

â€œNo,â€ he said, complete conviction in his voice. He gave me a straight, hard look. â€œAnd itâ€™s no that I canna bear the thought of it, either. I know.â€

â€œOf course,â€ I said hastily, eager to leave the subject.

â€œI know,â€ he repeated more sharply. His two stiff fingers tapped, once, against his leg, and then stilled. â€œI thought of it, too. When he first told me he meant to wed Isobel Dunsany.â€

He turned away, staring out through the window. Adso was in the dooryard, stalking something in the grass.

â€œI offered him my body,â€ Jamie said abruptly, not looking round. The words were steady enough, but I could see from the knotted shoulders how much it cost him to speak them. â€œIn thanks, I said. But it wasâ€”â€ He made an odd convulsive movement, as though trying to free himself from some constraint. â€œI meant to see, ken, what sort of man he might be, for sure. This man who would take my son for his own.â€

His voice shook, very slightly, when he said, â€œtake my son,â€ and I moved to him by instinct, wanting somehow to patch the open wound beneath those words.

He was stiff when I touched him, not wanting to be embracedâ€”but he took my hand and squeezed it.

â€œCould you . . . really tell, do you think?â€ I was not shocked; John Grey had told me of that offer, years before, in Jamaica. I didnâ€™t think he had realized the true nature of it, though.

Jamieâ€™s hand tightened on mine, and his thumb traced the outline of mine, rubbing lightly over the nail. He looked down at me, and I felt his eyes search my faceâ€”not in question, but in the way one does when seeing anew some object grown familiarâ€”seeing with the eyes what has been seen for a long time only with the heart.

His free hand rose and traced the line of my brows, two fingers resting for an instant on the bone of my cheek, then moved up, back, cool in the warmth of my hair.

â€œYe canna be so close to another,â€ he said finally. â€œTo be within each other, to smell their sweat, and rub the hairs of your body with theirs and see nothing of their soul. Or if ye can do that . . .â€ He hesitated, and I wondered whether he thought of Black Jack Randall, or of Laoghaire, the woman he had married, thinking me dead. â€œWell . . . that is a dreadful thing in itself,â€ he finished softly, and his hand dropped away.

There was silence between us. A sudden rustle came from the grass outside as Adso lunged and disappeared, and a mockingbird began to shriek alarm from the big red spruce. In the kitchen, something was dropped with a clang, and then the rhythmic shoosh of sweeping began. All the homely sounds of this life we had made.

Had I ever done that? Lain with a man, and seen nothing of his soul? Indeed I had, and he was right. A breath of coldness touched me, and the hairs rose, silent on my skin.

He heaved a sigh that seemed to come from his feet, and rubbed a hand over his bound hair.

â€œBut he wouldna do it. John.â€ He looked up then, and gave me a crooked smile. â€œHe loved me, he said. And if I couldna give him that in returnâ€”and he kent I couldnâ€™tâ€”then heâ€™d not take counterfeit for true coin.â€

He shook himself, hard, like a dog coming out of the water.

â€œNo. A man who would say such a thing is not one whoâ€™d bugger a child for the sake of his fatherâ€™s bonny blue eyes, Iâ€™ll tell ye that for certain, Sassenach.â€

â€œNo,â€ I said. â€œTell me . . .â€ I hesitated, and he looked at me, one eyebrow up. â€œIfâ€”if he had . . . er . . . taken you up on that offerâ€”and youâ€™d found him . . .â€ I fumbled for some reasonable wording. â€œLess, um, decent than you might hopeâ€”â€

â€œI should have broken his neck there by the lake,â€ he said. â€œIt wouldna have mattered if theyâ€™d hanged me; Iâ€™d not have let him have the boy.

â€œBut he didnâ€™t, and I did,â€ he added with a half-shrug. â€œAnd if wee Bobby goes to his Lordshipâ€™s bed, I think it will be of his own free will.â€



NO MAN IS really at his best with someone elseâ€™s hand up his arse. I had noticed this before, and Robert Higgins was no exception to the general rule.

â€œNow, this wonâ€™t hurt much at all,â€ I said as soothingly as possible. â€œAll you need to do is to keep quite still.â€

â€œOh, I sâ€™all do that, mum, indeed I will,â€ he assured me fervently.

I had him on the surgery table, wearing only his shirt, and situated foursquare on hands and knees, which brought the area of operation conveniently to eye level. The forceps and ligatures I should need were placed on the small table to my right, with a bowl of fresh leeches alongside, in case of need.

He emitted a small shriek when I applied a wet cloth soaked in turpentine to the area, in order to cleanse it thoroughly, but was as good as his word and didnâ€™t move.

â€œNow, we are going to obtain a very good effect here,â€ I assured him, taking up a pair of long-nosed forceps. â€œBut if the relief is to be permanent, there will have to be a drastic change in your diet. Do you understand me?â€

He gasped deeply, as I grasped one of the hemorrhoids and pulled it toward me. There were three, a classic presentation, at nine, two, and five oâ€™clock. Bulbous as raspberries, and quite the same color.

â€œOh! Y-yes, mum.â€

â€œOatmeal,â€ I said firmly, transferring the forceps to my other hand without lessening the grip, and taking up a needle threaded with silk thread in my right. â€œPorridge every morning, without fail. Have you noticed a change for the better in your bowel habits, since Mrs. Bug has been feeding you parritch for breakfast?â€

I passed the thread loosely round the base of the hemorrhoid, then delicately pushed the needle up beneath the loop, making a small noose of it, and pulled tight.

â€œAhhh . . . oh! Erm . . . tell â€™ee truth, mum, itâ€™s like shitting house bricks covered with hedgehog skin, makes no matter what I eat.â€

â€œWell, it will,â€ I assured him, securing the ligature with a knot. I released the hemorrhoid, and he breathed deeply. â€œNow, grapes. You like grapes, donâ€™t you?â€

â€œNoâ€™m. Sets me teeth on edge to bite â€™em.â€

â€œReally?â€ His teeth didnâ€™t look badly decayed; I should have a closer look at his mouth; he might be suffering from marginal scurvy. â€œWell, weâ€™ll have Mrs. Bug make a nice raisin pie for you; you can eat that with no difficulty. Does Lord John have a capable cook?â€ I took aim with my forceps and got hold of the next one. Now accustomed to the sensation, he only grunted a bit.

â€œYessum. Be an Indian, he is, named Manoke.â€

â€œHmm.â€ Round, up, tighten, tie off. â€œIâ€™ll write out a receipt for the raisin pie, for you to carry back to him. Does he cook yams, or beans? Beans are quite good for the purpose.â€

â€œI bâ€™lieve he does, mum, but his Lordshipâ€”â€

I had the windows open for ventilationâ€”Bobby was no filthier than the average, but he was certainly no cleanerâ€”and at this point, I heard sounds from the trailhead; voices, and the jingle of harness.

Bobby heard them, too, and glanced wildly at the window, hindquarters tensing as though to spring off the table like a grasshopper. I grasped him by one leg, but then thought better of it. There was no way of covering the window, bar closing the shutters, and I needed the light.

â€œGo ahead and stand up,â€ I told him, letting go and reaching for a towel. â€œIâ€™ll go and see who it is.â€ He followed this direction with alacrity, scrambling down and reaching hastily for his breeches.

I stepped out onto the porch, in time to greet the two men who led their mules up over the last arduous slope and into the yard. Richard Brown, and his brother Lionel, from the eponymously named Brownsville.

I was surprised to see them; it was a good three-day ride to Brownsville from the Ridge, and there was little commerce between the two settlements. It was at least that far to Salem, in the opposite direction, but the inhabitants of the Ridge went there much more frequently; the Moravians were both industrious and great traders, taking honey, oil, salt fish, and hides in trade for cheese, pottery, chickens, and other small livestock. So far as I knew, the denizens of Brownsville dealt only in cheap trade goods for the Cherokee, and in the production of a very inferior type of beer, not worth the ride.

â€œGood day, mistress.â€ Richard, the smaller and elder of the brothers, touched the brim of his hat, but didnâ€™t take it off. â€œIs your husband to home?â€

â€œHeâ€™s out by the hay barn, scraping hides.â€ I wiped my hands carefully on the towel I was carrying. â€œDo come round to the kitchen; Iâ€™ll bring up some cider.â€

â€œDonâ€™t trouble.â€ Without further ado, he turned and set off purposefully round the house. Lionel Brown, a bit taller than his brother, though with the same spare, almost gangly build and the same tobacco-colored hair, nodded briefly to me as he followed.

They had left their mules, reins hanging, evidently for me to tend. The animals were beginning to amble slowly across the yard, pausing to crop the long grass that edged the path.

â€œHmpf!â€ I said, glaring after the brothers Brown.

â€œWho are they?â€ said a low voice behind me. Bobby Higgins had come out and was peering off the corner of the porch with his good eye. Bobby tended to be wary of strangersâ€”and no wonder, given his experiences in Boston.

â€œNeighbors, such as they are.â€ I lunged off the porch and caught one of the mules by the bridle as he reached for the peach sapling I had planted near the porch. Disliking this interference in his affairs, he brayed ear-splittingly in my face, and attempted to bite me.

â€œHere, mum, let me.â€ Bobby, already holding the other muleâ€™s reins, leaned past to take the halter from me. â€œHark at â€™ee!â€ he said to the obstreperous mule. â€œHush tha noise, else I take a stick to â€™ee, then!â€

Bobby had been a foot soldier rather than cavalry, it was clear to see. The words were bold enough, but ill-matched with his tentative manner. He gave a perfunctory yank on the muleâ€™s reins. The mule promptly laid back its ears and bit him in the arm.

He screamed and let go both sets of reins. Clarence, my own mule, hearing the racket, set up a loud bray of greeting from his pen, and the two strange mules promptly trotted off in that direction, stirrup leathers bouncing.

Bobby wasnâ€™t badly hurt, though the muleâ€™s teeth had broken the skin; spots of blood seeped through the sleeve of his shirt. As I was turning back the cloth to have a look at it, I heard footsteps on the porch, and looked up to see Lizzie, a large wooden spoon in hand, looking alarmed.

â€œBobby! Whatâ€™s happened?â€

He straightened at once, seeing her, assuming nonchalance, and brushed a lock of curly brown hair off his brow.

â€œAh, oh! Naught, miss. Bit oâ€™ trouble with tha sons oâ€™ Belial, like. No fear, itâ€™s fine.â€

Whereupon his eyes rolled up in his head and he fell over in a dead faint.

â€œOh!â€ Lizzie flew down the steps and knelt beside him, urgently patting his cheek. â€œIs he all right, Mrs. Fraser?â€

â€œGod knows,â€ I said frankly. â€œI think so, though.â€ Bobby appeared to be breathing normally, and I found a reasonable pulse in his wrist.

â€œShall we carry him inside? Or should I fetch a burnt feather, do you think? Or the spirits of ammonia from the surgery? Or some brandy?â€ Lizzie hovered like an anxious bumblebee, ready to fly off in any of several different directions.

â€œNo, I think heâ€™s coming round.â€ Most faints last only a few seconds, and I could see his chest lift as his breathing deepened.

â€œBit oâ€™ brandy wouldnâ€™t come amiss,â€ he murmured, eyelids beginning to flutter.

I nodded to Lizzie, who vanished back into the house, leaving her spoon behind on the grass.

â€œFeeling a bit peaky, are you?â€ I inquired sympathetically. The injury to his arm was no more than a scratch, and I certainly hadnâ€™t done anything of a shocking nature to himâ€”well, not physically shocking. What was the trouble here?

â€œI dunno, mum.â€ He was trying to sit up, and while he was white as a sheet, seemed otherwise all right, so I let him. â€œItâ€™s only, every now and again, I gets these spots, like, whirring round me head like a swarm oâ€™ bees, and then it all goes black.â€

â€œNow and again? Itâ€™s happened before?â€ I asked sharply.

â€œYessum.â€ His head wobbled like a sunflower in the breeze, and I put a hand under his armpit, lest he fall over again. â€œHis Lordship was in hopes you might know summat would stop it.â€

â€œHis Lordâ€”oh, he knew about the fainting?â€ Well, of course he would, if Bobby were in the habit of falling over in front of him.

He nodded, and took a deep, gasping breath.

â€œDoctor Potts bled me regular, twice a week, but it didnâ€™t seem to help.â€

â€œI daresay not. I hope he was of somewhat more help with your piles,â€ I remarked dryly.

A faint tinge of pinkâ€”he had scarcely enough blood to provide a decent blush, poor boyâ€”rose in his cheeks, and he glanced away, fixing his gaze on the spoon.

â€œErm . . . I, um, didnâ€™t mention that to anybody.â€

â€œYou didnâ€™t?â€ I was surprised at that. â€œButâ€”â€

â€œSee, â€™twas only the riding. From Virginia.â€ The pink tinge grew. â€œIâ€™d not have let on, save I was in such agony after a week on yon bloody horseâ€”saving your presence, mumâ€”Iâ€™d no chance of hiding it.â€

â€œSo Lord John didnâ€™t know about that, either?â€

He shook his head vigorously, making the disheveled brown curls flop back over his forehead. I felt rather annoyedâ€”with myself for having evidently misjudged John Greyâ€™s motives, and with John Grey, for making me feel a fool.

â€œWell . . . are you feeling a bit better, now?â€ Lizzie was not appearing with the brandy, and I wondered momentarily where she was. Bobby was still very pale, but nodded gamely, and struggled to his feet, where he stood swaying and blinking, trying to keep his balance. The â€œMâ€ branded on his cheek stood out, an angry red against the pallid skin.

Distracted by Bobbyâ€™s faint, I had ignored the sounds coming from the other side of the house. Now, though, I became aware of voices, and approaching footsteps.

Jamie and the two Browns came into sight round the corner of the house, then stopped, seeing us. Jamie had been frowning slightly; the frown grew deeper. The Browns, by contrast, seemed oddly elated, though in a grim sort of way.

â€œSo itâ€™s true, then.â€ Richard Brown stared hard at Bobby Higgins, then turned to Jamie. â€œYouâ€™ve a murderer on your premises!â€

â€œHave I?â€ Jamie was coldly polite. â€œIâ€™d no idea.â€ He bowed to Bobby Higgins with his best French-court manner, then straightened, gesturing to the Browns. â€œMr. Higgins, may I present Mr. Richard Brown and Mr. Lionel Brown. Gentlemen, my guest, Mr. Higgins.â€ The words â€œmy guestâ€ were spoken with a particular emphasis that made Richard Brownâ€™s thin mouth compress to near invisibility.

â€œHave a care, Fraser,â€ he said, staring hard at Bobby, as though daring him to evaporate. â€œKeeping the wrong company can be dangerous, these days.â€

â€œI choose my company as I will, sir.â€ Jamie spoke softly, biting off each word between his teeth. â€œAnd I do not choose yours. Joseph!â€

Lizzieâ€™s father, Joseph Wemyss, appeared round the corner, leading the two renegade mules, who now seemed docile as kittens, though either of them dwarfed Mr. Wemyss.

Bobby Higgins, flabbergasted by the proceedings, looked wildly at me for explanation. I shrugged slightly, and kept silence as the two Browns mounted and rode out of the clearing, backs stiff with anger.

Jamie waited â€™til theyâ€™d disappeared from view, then blew out his breath, rubbing a hand viciously through his hair and muttering something in Gaelic. I didnâ€™t follow the finer points, but I gathered that he was comparing the character of our recent visitors to that of Mr. Higginsâ€™s pilesâ€”to the detriment of the former.

â€œBeg pardon, sir?â€ Higgins looked bewildered, but anxious to please.

Jamie glanced at him.

â€œLet them awaâ€™ and bile their heids,â€ he said, dismissing the Browns with a flip of the hand. He caught my eye and turned toward the house. â€œCome ben, Bobby; Iâ€™ve a thing or two to say to ye.â€



I FOLLOWED them in, both from curiosity and in case Mr. Higgins should feel faint again; he seemed steady enough, but still very pale. By contrast with Bobby Higgins, Mr. Wemyssâ€”fair-haired and slight as his daughterâ€”looked the picture of ruddy health. Whatever was the matter with Bobby? I wondered. I stole a discreet look at the seat of his breeches as I followed him, but that was all right; no bleeding.

Jamie led the way into his study, gesturing at the motley collection of stools and boxes he used for visitors, but both Bobby and Mr. Wemyss chose to standâ€”Bobby for obvious reasons, Mr. Wemyss from respect; he was never comfortable sitting in Jamieâ€™s presence, save at meals.

Unhampered by either bodily or social reservations, I settled myself on the best stool and raised one eyebrow at Jamie, who had sat down himself at the table he used as a desk.

â€œThis is the way of it,â€ he said without preamble. â€œBrown and his brother have declared themselves head of a Committee of Safety, and came to enlist me and my tenants as members of it.â€ He glanced at me, the corner of his mouth curling a little. â€œI declined, as ye doubtless noticed.â€

My stomach contracted slightly, thinking of what Major MacDonald had saidâ€”and of what I knew. It was beginning, then.

â€œCommittee of Safety?â€ Mr. Wemyss looked bewildered, and glanced at Bobby Higginsâ€”who was beginning to look substantially less so.

â€œHave they, so?â€ Bobby said softly. Strands of curly brown hair had escaped from their binding; he fingered one back behind his ear.

â€œYeâ€™ve heard of such committees before, Mr. Higgins?â€ Jamie inquired, raising one brow.

â€œMet one, zur. Close-like.â€ Bobby touched a finger briefly below his blind eye. He was still pale, but beginning to recover his self-possession. â€œMobs they be, zur. Like they mules, but more of themâ€”and more wicious.â€ He gave a lopsided smile, smoothing the shirt-sleeve over the bite on his arm.

The mention of mules reminded me abruptly, and I stood up, putting a sudden stop to the conversation.

â€œLizzie! Whereâ€™s Lizzie?â€

Not waiting for an answer to this rhetorical question, I went to the study door and shouted her nameâ€”only to be met by silence. Sheâ€™d gone in for brandy; there was plenty, in a jug in the kitchen, and she knew thatâ€”Iâ€™d seen her reach it down for Mrs. Bug only the night before. She must be in the house. Surely she wouldnâ€™t have goneâ€”

â€œElizabeth? Elizabeth, where are you?â€ Mr. Wemyss was right behind me, calling, as I strode down the hall to the kitchen.

Lizzie was lying in a dead faint on the hearth, a limp bundle of clothes, one frail hand flung out as though she had tried to save herself as she fell.

â€œMiss Wemyss!â€ Bobby Higgins shouldered his way past me, looking frantic, and scooped her up into his arms.

â€œElizabeth!â€ Mr. Wemyss elbowed his way past me as well, his face nearly as white as his daughterâ€™s.

â€œDo let me look at her, will you?â€ I said, elbowing firmly back. â€œPut her down on the settle, Bobby, do.â€

He rose carefully with her in his arms, then sat down on the settle, still holding her, wincing slightly as he did so. Well, if he wanted to be a hero, I hadnâ€™t time to argue with him. I knelt and seized her wrist in search of a pulse, smoothing the pale hair off her face with my other hand.

One look had been enough to tell me what was likely the matter. She was clammy to the touch, and the pallor of her face was tinged with gray. I could feel the tremor of oncoming chills that ran through her flesh, unconscious as she was.

â€œThe agueâ€™s back, is it?â€ Jamie asked. Heâ€™d appeared by my side, and was gripping Mr. Wemyss by the shoulder, at once comforting and restraining.

â€œYes,â€ I said briefly. Lizzie had malaria, contracted on the coast a few years before, and was subject to occasional relapsesâ€”though she hadnâ€™t had one in more than a year.

Mr. Wemyss took a deep, audible breath, a little color coming back to his face. He was familiar with malaria, and had confidence that I could deal with it. I had, several times before.

I hoped that I could this time. Lizzieâ€™s pulse was fast and light under my fingers, but regular, and she was beginning to stir. Still, the speed and suddenness with which the attack had come on was frightening. Had she had any warning? I hoped the concern I felt didnâ€™t show on my face.

â€œTake her up to her bed, cover her, get a hot stone for her feet,â€ I said, rising and addressing Bobby and Mr. Wemyss briskly in turn. â€œIâ€™ll start some medicine brewing.â€

Jamie followed me down to the surgery, glancing back over his shoulder to be sure that the others were out of earshot before speaking.

â€œI thought ye were out of the Jesuit bark?â€ he asked, low-voiced.

â€œI am. Damn it.â€ Malaria was a chronic disease, but for the most part, I had been able to keep it under control with small, regular doses of cinchona bark. But I had run out of cinchona during the winter, and no one had yet been able to travel down to the coast for more.

â€œSo, then?â€

â€œIâ€™m thinking.â€

I pulled open the door of the cupboard, and gazed at the neat ranks of glass bottles thereinâ€”many of them empty, or with no more than a few scattered crumbs of leaf or root inside. Everything was depleted, after a cold, wet winter of grippe, influenza, chilblains, and hunting accidents.

Febrifuges. I had a number of things that would help a normal fever; malaria was something else. There was plenty of dogwood root and bark, at least; I had collected immense quantities during the fall, foreseeing the need. I took that down, and after a momentâ€™s thought, added the jar containing a sort of gentian known locally as â€œagueweed.â€

â€œPut on the kettle, will you?â€ I asked Jamie, frowning to myself as I crumbled roots, bark, and weed into my mortar. All I could do was to treat the superficial symptoms of fever and chill. And shock, I thought, better treat for that, too.

â€œAnd bring me a little honey, too, please!â€ I called after him, as he had already reached the door. He nodded and went hurriedly toward the kitchen, his footsteps quick and solid on the oak floorboards.

I began to pound the mixture, still turning over additional possibilities. Some small part of my mind was half-glad of the emergency; I could put off for a little while the necessity of hearing about the Browns and their beastly committee.

I had a most uneasy feeling. Whatever they wanted, it didnâ€™t portend anything good, I was sure; they certainly hadnâ€™t left on friendly terms. As for what Jamie might feel obliged to do in response to themâ€”

Horse chestnut. That was sometimes used for the tertian ague, as Dr. Rawlings called it. Did I have any left? Glancing quickly over the jars and bottles in the medicine chest, I stopped, seeing one with an inch or so of dried black globules left at the bottom. Gallberries, the label read. Not mine; it was one of Rawlingsâ€™s jars. Iâ€™d never used them for anything. But something niggled at my memory. Iâ€™d heard or read something about gallberries; what was it?

Half-unconsciously, I picked up the jar and opened it, sniffing. A sharp, astringent smell rose from the berries, slightly bitter. And slightly familiar.

Still holding the jar, I went to the table where my big black casebook lay, and flipped hastily to the early pages, those notes left by the man who had first owned both book and medicine chest, Daniel Rawlings. Where had it been?

I was still flipping pages, scanning for the shape of a half-remembered note, when Jamie came back, a jug of hot water and a dish of honey in handâ€”and the Beardsley twins dogging his steps.

I glanced at them, but said nothing; they tended to pop up unexpectedly, like a pair of jack-in-the boxes.

â€œIs Miss Lizzie fearfully sick?â€ Jo asked anxiously, peering around Jamie to see what I was doing.

â€œYes,â€ I said briefly, only half paying attention to him. â€œDonâ€™t worry, though; Iâ€™m fixing her some medicine.â€

There it was. A brief notation, added as an obvious afterthought to the account of treatment of a patient whose symptoms seemed clearly malarialâ€”and who had, I noticed with an unpleasant twinge, died.

I am told by the Trader from whom I procured Jesuit Bark that the Indians use a Plant called Gallberry, which rivals the Bark of Cinchona for bitterness and is thought capital for Use in tertian and quartan Fevers. I have collected some for Experiment and propose to try an Infusion so soon as the Opportunity presents itself.

I picked out one of the dried berries and bit into it. The pungent taste of quinine at once flooded my mouthâ€”accompanied by a copious flood of saliva, as my mouth puckered at the eye-watering bitterness. Gallberry, indeed!

I dived for the open window, spat into the herb bed beneath and went on spitting, to the accompaniment of giggles and snorts from the Beardsleys, who were most diverted at the unexpected entertainment.

â€œAre ye all right, Sassenach?â€ Amusement was fighting with worry for dominance of Jamieâ€™s face. He poured a bit of water from the jug into a clay beaker, added a dollop of honey as an afterthought, and handed it to me.

â€œFine,â€ I croaked. â€œDonâ€™t drop that!â€ Kezzie Beardsley had picked up the jar of gallberries and was sniffing cautiously at it. He nodded at my admonition, but didnâ€™t put the jar down, instead handing it off to his brother.

I took a good mouthful of hot, honeyed water, and swallowed. â€œThoseâ€”they have something like quinine in them.â€

Jamieâ€™s face changed at once, the worry lessening.

â€œSo theyâ€™ll help the lass?â€

â€œI hope so. There arenâ€™t many, though.â€

â€œDâ€™ye mean you need more oâ€™ these things for Miss Lizzie, Mrs. Fraser?â€ Jo glanced up at me, dark eyes sharp over the little jar.

â€œYes,â€ I said, surprised. â€œYou donâ€™t mean you know where to get any, surely?â€

â€œAye, maâ€™am,â€ Kezzie said, his voice a little loud, as usual. â€œIndians got â€™em.â€

â€œWhich Indians?â€ Jamie asked, his gaze sharpening.

â€œThem Cherokee,â€ Jo said, waving vaguely over one shoulder. â€œBy the mountain.â€

This description might have suited half a dozen villages, but evidently it was a specific village that they had in mind, for the two of them turned as one, obviously intending to go directly and fetch back gallberries.

â€œWait a bit, lads,â€ Jamie said, snagging Kezzie by the collar. â€œIâ€™ll go along with ye. Yeâ€™ll be needing something to trade, after all.â€

â€œOh, we got hides a-plenty, sir,â€ Jo assured him. â€œâ€™Twas a good season.â€

Jo was an expert hunter, and while Kezzie still hadnâ€™t sufficiently keen hearing to hunt well, his brother had taught him to run traplines. Ian had told me that the Beardsleysâ€™ shack was stacked nearly to the rooftree with the hides of beaver, marten, deer, and ermine. The smell of it always clung to them, a faint miasma of dried blood, musk, and cold hair.

â€œAye? Well, thatâ€™s generous of ye, Jo, to be sure. But Iâ€™ll come, nonetheless.â€ Jamie glanced at me, acknowledging the fact that he had made his decisionâ€”but asking for my approval, nonetheless. I swallowed, tasting bitterness.

â€œYes,â€ I said, and cleared my throat. â€œIfâ€”if youâ€™re going, let me send some things, and tell you what to ask for in trade. You wonâ€™t leave until morning, surely?â€

The Beardsleys were vibrating with impatience to be gone, but Jamie stood still, looking at me, and I felt him touch me, without words or movement.

â€œNo,â€ he said softly, â€œweâ€™ll bide for the night.â€ He turned then to the Beardsleys. â€œGo up, will ye, Jo, and ask Bobby Higgins to come down. Iâ€™ll need to speak with him.â€

â€œHeâ€™s up with Miss Lizzie?â€ Jo Beardsley looked displeased at this, and his brotherâ€™s face echoed his expression of slit-eyed suspicion.

â€œWhatâ€™s he a-doinâ€™ in her room, then? Donâ€™t he know sheâ€™s betrothed?â€ Kezzie asked, righteously.

â€œHer fatherâ€™s with her, too,â€ Jamie assured them. â€œHer reputationâ€™s safe, aye?â€

Jo snorted briefly, but the brothers exchanged glances, then left together, slender shoulders set in determination to oust this threat to Lizzieâ€™s virtue.

â€œSo youâ€™ll do it?â€ I set down the pestle. â€œBe an Indian agent?â€

â€œI think I must. If I do notâ€”Richard Brown surely will. I think I canna risk that.â€ He hesitated, then drew close and touched me lightly, fingers on my elbow. â€œIâ€™ll send the lads back at once with the berries ye need. I may need to stay for a day, maybe two. For the talking, aye?â€ To tell the Cherokee that he was now an agent for the British Crown, he meantâ€”and to make arrangements for word to be spread that the headmen of the mountain villages should come down later to a council for parley and gifts.

I nodded, feeling a small bubble of fear swell under my breastbone. It was starting. No matter how much one knows that something dreadful is going to happen in the future, one somehow never thinks it will be today.

â€œNotâ€”donâ€™t stay away too long, will you?â€ I blurted, not wanting to burden him with my fears, but unable to keep quiet.

â€œNo,â€ he said softly, and his hand rested for an instant in the small of my back. â€œDinna fash yourself; Iâ€™ll not tarry.â€

The sound of feet descending the stairs echoed in the hall. I supposed Mr. Wemyss had shooed the Beardsleys out, along with Bobby. They didnâ€™t stop, but went off without speaking, casting looks of veiled dislike at Bobby, who seemed quite oblivious to them.

â€œYon lad said you wanted to speak to me, zur?â€ Heâ€™d regained some color, I was glad to see, and seemed steady enough on his feet. He glanced uneasily at the table, still spread with the sheet Iâ€™d put him on, and then at me, but I merely shook my head. Iâ€™d finish dealing with his piles later.

â€œAye, Bobby.â€ Jamie made a brief gesture toward a stool, as though to invite Bobby to sit, but I cleared my throat in a meaningful manner, and he stopped, then leaned against the table, rather than sitting down himself.

â€œThose two who cameâ€”Brown, theyâ€™re called. Theyâ€™ve a settlement some way away. Ye said yeâ€™ve heard of the Committees of Safety, aye? So yeâ€™ll have some notion what theyâ€™re about.â€

â€œAye, zur. Tha Browns, zurâ€”did they want me?â€ He spoke calmly enough, but I saw him swallow briefly, Adamâ€™s apple bobbing in his slender throat.

Jamie sighed, and ran a hand through his hair. The sun was slanting through the window now, and struck him directly, making his red hair glow with flameâ€”and picking out here and there a flicker of the silver that was beginning to show among the ruddy strands.

â€œThey did. They kent ye were here; heard of ye, doubtless from someone ye met along the way. Yeâ€™ll have told folk where ye were headed, I suppose?â€

Bobby nodded, wordless.

â€œWhat did they want with him?â€ I asked, tipping the ground root bark and berries into a bowl and pouring hot water over them to steep.

â€œThey didna make that quite clear,â€ Jamie said dryly. â€œBut then, I didna give them the chance. I only told them theyâ€™d take a guest from my hearth over my dead bodyâ€”and theirs.â€

â€œI thanks â€™ee for that, zur.â€ Bobby took a deep breath. â€œTheyâ€”knew, I reckon? About Boston? Iâ€™d not told anyone that, surely.â€

Jamieâ€™s frown deepened slightly.

â€œAye, they did. They pretended to think I didna ken; told me I was harboring a murderer unbeknownst, and a threat to the public welfare.â€

â€œWell, the first is true enough,â€ Bobby said, touching his brand gingerly, as though it still burned him. He offered a wan smile. â€œBut I dunno as I sâ€™ould be a threat to anyone, these days.â€

Jamie dismissed that.

â€œThe point is, Bobby, that they do ken yeâ€™re here. Theyâ€™ll not come and drag ye away, I think. But Iâ€™d ask ye to go canny about the place. Iâ€™ll make provision to see ye safely back to Lord John, when the time comes, with an escort. I gather yeâ€™re no quite finished with him?â€ he asked, turning to me.

â€œNot quite,â€ I replied equably. Bobby looked apprehensive.

â€œWell, then.â€ Jamie reached into the waist of his breeches, and drew out a pistol, which had been hidden by the folds of his shirt. It was, I saw, the fancy gilt-edged one.

â€œKeep it by ye,â€ Jamie said, handing it to Bobby. â€œThereâ€™s powder and shot in the sideboard. Will ye look out for my wife and family, then, whilst Iâ€™m gone?â€

â€œOh!â€ Bobby looked startled, but then nodded, tucking the pistol away in his own breeches. â€œI will so, zur. Depend upon it!â€

Jamie smiled at him, his eyes warming.

â€œThatâ€™s a comfort to me, Bobby. Will ye maybe go and find my son-in-law? Iâ€™ll need a word with him before I go.â€

â€œAye, zur. Right away!â€ He squared his shoulders and set off, an expression of determination on his poetâ€™s face.

â€œWhat do you think they would have done with him?â€ I asked softly, as the outer door closed behind him. â€œThe Browns.â€

Jamie shook his head.

â€œGod knows. Hanged him at a crossroad, maybeâ€”or maybe only beaten him and driven him out of the mountains. They want to make a show of being able to protect the folk, aye? From dangerous criminals and the like,â€ he added, with a twist of the mouth.

â€œA government derives its powers from the just consent of the governed,â€ I quoted, nodding. â€œFor a Committee of Safety to have any legitimacy, there needs to be an obvious threat to the public safety. Clever of the Browns to have reasoned that out.â€

He gave me a look, one auburn brow raised.

â€œWho said that? The consent of the governed.â€

â€œThomas Jefferson,â€ I replied, feeling smug. â€œOr rather, he will say it in another two years.â€

â€œHeâ€™ll steal it from a gentleman named Locke in another two years,â€ he corrected. â€œI suppose Richard Brown must haâ€™ been decently educated.â€

â€œUnlike me, you mean?â€ I said, unruffled. â€œIf you expect trouble from the Browns, though, should you have given Bobby that particular pistol?â€

He shrugged.

â€œIâ€™ll need the good ones. And I doubt verra much that heâ€™ll fire that one.â€

â€œCounting on its deterrent effect?â€ I was skeptical, but he was likely right.

â€œAye, that. But more on Bobby.â€

â€œHow so?â€

â€œI doubt heâ€™d fire a gun again to save his own lifeâ€”but he would, maybe, to save yours. And should it come to such a pass, theyâ€™ll be too close to miss.â€ He spoke with dispassion, but I felt the hairs prickle down my nape.

â€œWell, thatâ€™s a comfort,â€ I said. â€œAnd just how do you know what heâ€™d do?â€

â€œTalked to him,â€ he said briefly. â€œThe man he shot in Boston was the first heâ€™d ever killed. He doesna want to do it again.â€ He straightened, and moved restlessly toward the counter, where he busied himself in straightening a scatter of small instruments I had laid out for cleaning.

I moved to stand beside him, watching. There was a handful of small cautery irons and scalpels, soaking in a beaker of turpentine. He took them out, one by one, wiped them dry and laid them back in their box, neatly, side by side. The spade-shaped metal ends of the irons were blackened by use; the scalpel blades were weathered to a soft glow, but the sharp edges gleamed, a hairbreadth of bright silver.

â€œWeâ€™ll be all right,â€ I said quietly. I meant it to be a reassuring statement, but it came out with a tinge of question.

â€œAye, I know,â€ he said. He put the last iron in its box, but didnâ€™t replace the lid. Instead, he stood, hands spread flat on the counter, looking straight ahead.

â€œI dinna want to go,â€ he said softly. â€œI dinna want to do this.â€

I wasnâ€™t sure whether he was speaking to me, or to himselfâ€”but I thought he wasnâ€™t referring only to his journey to the Cherokee village.

â€œNeither do I,â€ I whispered, and moved a little closer, so I felt his breathing. He lifted his hands then and turned toward me, taking me into his arms, and we stood wrapped close, listening to each otherâ€™s breathing, the bitter smell of the brewing tea seeping through the homely scents of linen, dust, and sun-warmed flesh.

There were still choices to be made, decisions to reach, actions to take. Many of them. But in one day, one hour, one single declaration of intent, we had stepped across the threshold of war.

DUTY CALLS




JAMIE HAD SENT BOBBY after Roger Mac, but found himself too restless to wait, and set off himself, leaving Claire to her brewing.

Everything seemed peaceful and beautiful outside. A brown sheep with a pair of lambs stood indolently in her pen, jaws moving in a slow stupor of satisfaction, the lambs hopping awkwardly to and fro like fuzzy grasshoppers behind her. Claireâ€™s herb bed was full of leafing greens and sprouting flowers.

The well lid was ajar; he bent to draw it into place and found the boards had warped. He added fixing that to the constant list of chores and repairs that he carried in his head, wishing fervently that he could devote the next few days to digging, hauling manure, shingling, and the like, instead of what he was about to do.

Heâ€™d rather bury the old privy pit or castrate pigs than go and ask Roger Mac what he kent about Indians and revolutions. He found it mildly gruesome to discuss the future with his son-in-law, and tried never to do it.

The things Claire told him of her own time seemed often fantastic, with the enjoyable half-real sense of faery tales, and sometimes macabre, but always interesting, for what he learned of his wife from the telling. Brianna tended to share with him small, homely details of machinery, which were interesting, or wild stories of men walking on the moon, which were immensely entertaining, but no threat to his peace of mind.

Roger Mac, though, had a cold-blooded way of talking that reminded him to an uncomfortable degree of the works of the historians heâ€™d read, and had therefore a sense of concrete doom about it. Talking to Roger Mac made it seem all too likely that this, that, or the other frightful happenstance was not only indeed going to happenâ€”but would most likely have direct and personal consequences.

It was like talking to a particularly evil-minded fortune-teller, he thought, one you hadnâ€™t paid enough to hear something pleasant. The thought made a sudden memory pop up on the surface of his mind, bobbing like a fishing cork.

In Paris. Heâ€™d been with friends, other students, drinking in the piss-smelling taverns near the universitÃ©. Heâ€™d been fairly drunk himself when someone took a fancy to have his palms read, and he had pushed with the others into the corner where the old woman who did it always sat, scarcely visible amid the gloom and clouds of pipe smoke.

He hadnâ€™t intended to do it himself; he had only a few pennies in his pocket, and didnâ€™t mean to waste them on unholy nonsense. Heâ€™d said so, loudly.

Whereupon a scraggy claw had shot out of the darkness and seized his hand, sinking long, filthy nails into his flesh. Heâ€™d yelped in surprise, and his friends all laughed. They laughed harder when she spat in his palm.

She rubbed the spittle into his skin in a businesslike way, bent close enough that he could smell the ancient sweat of her and see the lice crawling in the grizzled hair that keeked from the edge of her rusty-black shawl. She peered into his hand and a dirty nail traced the lines of it, tickling. He tried to pull his hand away, but she tightened her grip on his wrist, and he found to his surprise that he could not break it.

â€œTâ€™es un chat, toi,â€ the old woman had remarked, in tones of malicious interest. â€œYouâ€™re a cat, you. A little red cat.â€

Duboisâ€”that was his name, Duboisâ€”had at once begun to miaou and yowl, to the amusement of the others. He himself refused to rise to the bait, and saying only, â€œMerci, madame,â€ tried again to pull away.

â€œNeuf,â€ she said, tapping rapid random places on his palm, then seizing a finger and wiggling it by way of emphasis. â€œYou have a nine in your hand. And death,â€ sheâ€™d added offhandedly. â€œYouâ€™ll die nine times before you rest in your grave.â€

Sheâ€™d let go then, amidst a chorus of sarcastic â€œaou-la-las!â€ from the French students, and laughter from the rest.

He snorted, sending the memory back where it came from, and good riddance to it. The old woman refused to go so easily, though, and called to him through the years, as sheâ€™d called through the raucous, beer-filled air of the tavern.

â€œSometimes dying doesnâ€™t hurt, mon pâ€™tit chat,â€ sheâ€™d called after him, mocking. â€œBut more often it does.â€

â€œNo it doesnâ€™t,â€ he muttered, and stopped, appalled, hearing himself. Christ. It wasnâ€™t himself he was hearing, but his godfather.

â€œDonâ€™t be afraid, laddie. It doesna hurt a bit, to die.â€ He missed his footing and staggered, caught himself and stood still, a taste of metal on the back of his tongue.

His heart was thumping, suddenly, for no reason, as though he had run miles. He saw the cabin, certainly, and heard the calling of jays in the half-leafed chestnut trees. But he saw even more clearly Murtaghâ€™s face, the grim lines of it relaxing into peace and the deep-set black eyes fixed on his, shifting in and out of focus, as though his godfather looked at once at him and at something far beyond him. He felt the weight of Murtaghâ€™s body in his arms, growing suddenly heavy as he died.

The vision vanished, as abruptly as it had come, and he found himself standing next to a rain puddle, staring at a wooden duck half-mired in the mud.

He crossed himself, with a quick word for the repose of Murtaghâ€™s soul, then bent and retrieved the duck, washing the mud away in the puddle. His hands were trembling, and little wonder. His memories of Culloden were few and fragmentaryâ€”but they were beginning to come back.

So far, such things had come to him only in glimpses at the edge of sleep. Heâ€™d seen Murtagh there before, and in the dreams that followed.

He hadnâ€™t told Claire about them. Not yet.

He pushed open the door of the cabin, but it was empty, the hearth smoored, spinning wheel and loom standing idle. Brianna was likely at Fergusâ€™s place, visiting Marsali. Where would Roger Mac be now? He stepped back outside and stood listening.

The thump of an ax came faintly from somewhere in the forest beyond the cabin. It stopped, then, and he heard menâ€™s voices, raised in greeting. He turned and headed for the trail that led upslope, half grown over with spring grass, but showing the black smudges of fresh footmarks.

What might the old woman have told him if heâ€™d paid her? he wondered. Had she lied to spite him for his miserlinessâ€”or told him the truth, for the same reason?

One of the more disagreeable things about talking to Roger Mac was that Jamie was sure he always told the truth.

Heâ€™d forgotten to leave the duck at the cabin. Wiping it on his breeches, he pushed grimly through the sprouting weeds, to hear what fate awaited him.

BLOODWORK




I PUSHED THE MICROSCOPE toward Bobby Higgins, who had returned from his errand, his own discomforts forgotten in worry for Lizzie.

â€œSee the round pinkish things?â€ I said. â€œThose are Lizzieâ€™s blood cells. Everyone has blood cells,â€ I added. â€œTheyâ€™re what make your blood red.â€

â€œâ€˜Strewth,â€ he muttered, amazed. â€œI never knew!â€

â€œWell, now you do,â€ I said. â€œDo you see that some of the blood cells are broken? And that some have little spots in them?â€

â€œI do, mum,â€ he said, screwing up his face and peering intently. â€œWhat are â€™ey, then?â€

â€œParasites. Little beasts that get into your blood if a certain kind of mosquito bites you,â€ I explained. â€œTheyâ€™re called Plasmodium. Once youâ€™ve got them, they go on living in your bloodâ€”but every so often, they begin to . . . er . . . breed. When there are too many of them, they burst out of the blood cells, and thatâ€™s what causes a malarial attackâ€”the ague. The sludge of the broken blood cells sort of silts up, you see, in the organs, and makes you feel terribly sick.â€

â€œOh.â€ He straightened up, making a face of deep aversion at the microscope. â€œThatâ€™s . . . thatâ€™s pure gashly, that is!â€

â€œYes, it is,â€ I said, succeeding in keeping a straight face. â€œBut quinineâ€”Jesuit bark, you know?â€”will help stop it.â€

â€œOh, thatâ€™s good, mum, very good,â€ he said, his face lightening. â€œHowever you do come to know such things,â€ he said, shaking his head. â€œâ€™Tis a wonder!â€

â€œOh, I know quite a lot of things about parasites,â€ I said casually, taking the saucer off the bowl in which I had been brewing the mix of dogwood bark and gallberries. The liquid was a rich purplish black, and looked slightly viscous, now that it had cooled. It also smelled lethal, from which I deduced that it was about ready.

â€œTell me, Bobbyâ€”have you ever heard of hookworms?â€

He looked at me blankly.

â€œNo, mum.â€

â€œMm. Would you hold this for me, please?â€ I put a folded square of gauze over the neck of a flask and handed him the bottle to hold while I poured the purple mixture into it.

â€œThese fainting fits of yours,â€ I said, eyes on the stream. â€œHow long have you had them?â€

â€œOh . . . six months, mebbe.â€

â€œI see. Did you by chance notice any sort of irritationâ€”itching, say? Or a rash? Happening maybe seven months ago? Most likely on your feet.â€

He stared at me, soft blue eyes thunderstruck as though I had performed some feat of mind reading.

â€œWhy, so I did have, mum. Last autumn, â€™twas.â€

â€œAh,â€ I said. â€œWell, then. I think, Bobby, that you may just possibly have a case of hookworms.â€

He looked down at himself in horror.

â€œWhere?â€

â€œInside.â€ I took the bottle from him and corked it. â€œHookworms are parasites that burrow through the skinâ€”most often through the soles of the feetâ€”and then migrate through the body until they reach your intestinesâ€”your, um, innards,â€ I amended, seeing incomprehension cross his face. â€œThe adult worms have nasty little hooked bills, like thisâ€â€”I crooked my index finger in illustrationâ€”â€œand they pierce the intestinal lining and proceed to suck your blood. Thatâ€™s why, if you have them, you feel very weak, and faint frequently.â€

From the suddenly clammy look of him, I rather thought he was about to faint now, and guided him hastily to a stool, pushing his head down between his knees.

â€œI donâ€™t know for sure that thatâ€™s the problem,â€ I told him, bending down to address him. â€œI was just looking at the slides of Lizzieâ€™s blood, though, and thinking of parasites, andâ€”well, it came to me suddenly that a diagnosis of hookworms would fit your symptoms rather well.â€

â€œOh?â€ he said faintly. The thick tail of wavy hair had fallen forward, leaving the back of his neck exposed, fair-skinned and childlike.

â€œHow old are you, Bobby?â€ I asked, suddenly realizing that I had no idea.

â€œTwenty-three, mum,â€ he said. â€œMum? I think I sâ€™all have to puke.â€

I snatched a bucket from the corner and got it to him just in time.

â€œHave I got rid of them?â€ he asked weakly, sitting up and wiping his mouth on his sleeve as he peered into the bucket. â€œI could do it more.â€

â€œIâ€™m afraid not,â€ I said sympathetically. â€œAssuming that you have got hookworms, theyâ€™re attached very firmly, and too far down for vomiting to dislodge them. The only way to be sure about it, though, is to look for the eggs they shed.â€

Bobby eyed me apprehensively.

â€œItâ€™s not exactly as Iâ€™m horrible shy, mum,â€ he said, shifting gingerly. â€œYou know that. But Dr. Potts did give me great huge clysters of mustard water. Surely that would haâ€™ burnt they worms right out? If I was a worm, I sâ€™ould let go and give up the ghost at once, did anyone souse me with mustard water.â€

â€œWell, you would think so, wouldnâ€™t you?â€ I said. â€œUnfortunately not. But I wonâ€™t give you an enema,â€ I assured him. â€œWe need to see whether you truly do have the worms, to begin with, and if so, thereâ€™s a medicine I can mix up for you that will poison them directly.â€

â€œOh.â€ He looked a little happier at that. â€œHow dâ€™ye mean to see, then, mum?â€ He glanced narrowly at the counter, where the assortment of clamps and suture jars were still laid out.

â€œCouldnâ€™t be simpler,â€ I assured him. â€œI do a process called fecal sedimentation to concentrate the stool, then look for the eggs under the microscope.â€

He nodded, plainly not following. I smiled kindly at him.

â€œAll you have to do, Bobby, is shit.â€

His face was a study in doubt and apprehension.

â€œIf itâ€™s all the same to you, mum,â€ he said, â€œI think Iâ€™ll keep the worms.â€

FURTHER MYSTERIES

OF SCIENCE




LATE IN THE AFTERNOON, Roger MacKenzie came back from the cooperâ€™s shop to discover his wife deep in contemplation of an object sitting on his dinner table.

â€œWhat is that? Some type of prehistoric Christmas tinned goods?â€ Roger extended a ginger forefinger toward a squat jar made of greenish glass and sealed with a cork, the latter covered with a stout layer of red wax. An amorphous chunk of something was visible inside, evidently submerged in liquid.

â€œHo ho,â€ said his wife tolerantly, moving the jar out of his reach. â€œYou think youâ€™re being funny. Itâ€™s white phosphorusâ€”a present from Lord John.â€

He glanced at her; she was excited, the tip of her nose gone pink and bits of red hair pulled loose and waving in the breeze; like her father, she was inclined to run her hands through her hair when thinking.

â€œAnd you intend to do . . . what with it?â€ he asked, trying to keep any note of foreboding from his voice. He had the vaguest memories of hearing about the properties of phosphorus in his distant school days; he thought either it made you glow in the dark or it blew up. Neither prospect was reassuring.

â€œWellll . . . make matches. Maybe.â€ Her upper teeth fastened momentarily in the flesh of her lower lip as she considered the jar. â€œI know howâ€”in theory. But it might be a little tricky in practice.â€

â€œWhy is that?â€ he asked warily.

â€œWell, it bursts into flame if you expose it to air,â€ she explained. â€œThatâ€™s why itâ€™s packed in water. Donâ€™t touch, Jem! Itâ€™s poisonous.â€ Grabbing Jemmy round the middle, she pulled him down from the table, where he had been eyeing the jar with greedy curiosity.

â€œOh, well, why worry about that? It will explode in his face before he has a chance to get it in his mouth.â€ Roger picked up the jar for safekeeping, holding it as though it might go off in his hands. He wanted to ask whether she were insane, but had been married long enough to know the price of injudicious rhetorical questions.

â€œWhere dâ€™ye mean to keep it?â€ He cast an eloquent glance round the confines of the cabin, which in terms of storage boasted a blanket chest, a small shelf for books and papers, another for comb, toothbrushes, and Briannaâ€™s small cache of personal belongings, and a pie hutch. Jemmy had been able to open the pie hutch since the age of seven months or so.

â€œIâ€™m thinking Iâ€™d better put it in Mamaâ€™s surgery,â€ she replied, keeping an absentminded grip on Jem, who was struggling with single-minded energy to get at the pretty thing. â€œNobody touches anything in there.â€

That was true enough; the people who were not afraid of Claire Fraser personally were generally terrified of the contents of her surgery, these featuring fearsomely painful-looking implements, mysterious murky brews, and vile-smelling medicines. In addition, the surgery had cupboards too high for even a determined climber like Jem to reach.

â€œGood idea,â€ Roger said, anxious to get the jar out of Jemâ€™s vicinity. â€œIâ€™ll take it up now, shall I?â€

Before Brianna could answer, a knock came at the door, followed immediately by Jamie Fraser. Jem instantly ceased trying to get at the jar and instead flung himself on his grandfather with shrieks of joy.

â€œHow is it, then, a bhailach?â€ Jamie inquired amiably, neatly turning Jem upside down and holding him by the ankles. â€œA word, Roger Mac?â€

â€œSure. Yeâ€™ll sit, maybe?â€ Heâ€™d told Jamie earlier what he knewâ€”lamentably littleâ€”regarding the role of the Cherokee in the upcoming Revolution. Had he come to inquire further? Reluctantly setting down the jar, Roger pulled out a stool and pushed it in his father-in-lawâ€™s direction. Jamie accepted it with a nod, dexterously transferring Jemmy to a position over one shoulder and sitting down.

Jemmy giggled madly, squirming until his grandfather slapped him lightly on the seat of his breeches, whereupon he subsided, hanging contentedly upside-down like a sloth, his bright hair spilling down the back of Jamieâ€™s shirt.

â€œItâ€™s this way, a charaid,â€ Jamie said. â€œI must be going in the morning to the Cherokee villages, and there is a thing Iâ€™d ask ye to do in my place.â€

â€œOh, aye. Dâ€™ye want me to see to the barley harvest, then?â€ The early grain was still ripening. Everyone had his fingers crossed that the weather would keep fair for another few weeks, but the prospects were good.

â€œNo, Brianna can do thatâ€”if ye will, lass?â€ He smiled at his daughter, who raised thick ruddy eyebrows, the twins of his.

â€œI can,â€ she agreed. â€œWhat are you planning to do with Ian, Roger, and Arch Bug, though?â€ Arch Bug was Jamieâ€™s factor, and the logical person to be overseeing the harvest in Jamieâ€™s absence.

â€œWell, I shall take Young Ian with me. The Cherokee ken him well, and heâ€™s comfortable wiâ€™ their speech. Iâ€™ll take the Beardsley lads, too, so they can fetch back the berries and bits oâ€™ things your mother wants for Lizzie, straightaway.â€

â€œI go, too?â€ Jemmy inquired hopefully.

â€œNot this time, a bhailach. In the autumn, maybe.â€ He patted Jemmy on the bottom, then returned his attention to Roger.

â€œThat being so,â€ he said, â€œI need ye to go to Cross Creek, if ye will, and collect the new tenants.â€ Roger felt a small surge of excitementâ€”and alarmâ€”at the prospect, but merely cleared his throat and nodded.

â€œAye. Of course. Will theyâ€”â€

â€œYeâ€™ll take Arch Bug along, and Tom Christie.â€

A moment of incredulous silence greeted this statement.

â€œTom Christie?â€ Bree said, exchanging a glance of bafflement with Roger. â€œWhat on earth for?â€ The schoolmaster was a notably dour sort, and no oneâ€™s idea of a congenial traveling companion.

Her fatherâ€™s mouth twisted wryly.

â€œAye, well. Thereâ€™s the one small thing MacDonald neglected to tell me, when he asked if Iâ€™d take them. Theyâ€™re Protestants, the lot.â€

â€œAh,â€ said Roger. â€œI see.â€ Jamie met his eye and nodded, relieved to be so immediately understood.

â€œI donâ€™t see.â€ Brianna patted her hair, frowning, then pulled off the ribbon and began to comb her fingers slowly through it, undoing the tangles as a preliminary to brushing it. â€œWhat difference does it make?â€

Roger and Jamie exchanged a brief but eloquent glance. Jamie shrugged, and pulled Jem down into his lap.

â€œWell.â€ Roger rubbed his chin, trying to think how to explain two centuries of Scottish religious intolerance in any way that would make sense to an American of the twentieth century. â€œAhh . . . ye recall the civil-rights thing in the States, integration in the South, all that?â€

â€œOf course I do.â€ She narrowed her eyes at him. â€œOkay. So, which side are the Negroes?â€

â€œThe what?â€ Jamie looked entirely baffled. â€œWhere do Negroes come into the matter?â€

â€œNot quite that simple,â€ Roger assured her. â€œJust an indication of the depth of feeling involved. Let us say that the notion of having a Catholic landlord is likely to cause our new tenants severe qualmsâ€”and vice versa?â€ he asked, glancing at Jamie.

â€œWhatâ€™s Negroes?â€ Jemmy asked with interest.

â€œEr . . . .dark-skinned people,â€ Roger replied, suddenly aware of the potential quagmire opened up by this question. It was true that the term â€œNegroâ€ didnâ€™t invariably mean also â€œslaveâ€â€”but near enough that there was little difference. â€œDâ€™ye not remember them, from your great-auntie Jocastaâ€™s place?â€

Jemmy frowned, adopting for an unsettling instant the precise expression his grandfather was wearing.

â€œNo.â€

â€œWell, anyway,â€ Bree said, calling the meeting to order with a sharp rap of her hairbrush on the table, â€œthe point is that Mr. Christie is enough of a Protestant to make the new people feel comfortable?â€

â€œSomething of the sort,â€ her father agreed, one side of his mouth curling up. â€œBetween your man here and Tom Christie, at least theyâ€™ll not think theyâ€™re entering the Devilâ€™s realm entirely.â€

â€œI see,â€ Roger said again, in a slightly different tone. So it wasnâ€™t only his position as son of the house and general right-hand man, was itâ€”but the fact that he was a Presbyterian, at least in name. He raised a brow at Jamie, who shrugged in acknowledgment.

â€œMmphm,â€ Roger said, resigned.

â€œMmphm,â€ said Jamie, satisfied.

â€œStop doing that,â€ Brianna said crossly. â€œFine. So you and Tom Christie are going to Cross Creek. Why is Arch Bug going?â€

Roger became aware, in a subliminally marital way, that his wife was disgruntled at the thought of being left behind to organize the harvestâ€”a filthy, exhausting job at the best of timesâ€”whilst he frolicked with a squad of his co-religionists in the romantically exciting metropolis of Cross Creek, population two hundred.

â€œIt will be Arch, mostly, helping them to settle and build themselves shelter before the cold,â€ Jamie said logically. â€œYe dinna mean to suggest, I hope, that I send him alone to talk to them?â€

Brianna smiled involuntarily at that; Arch Bug, married for decades to the voluble Mrs. Bug, was famous for his lack of speech. He could talk, but seldom did so, limiting his conversational contributions to the occasional genial â€œMmp.â€

â€œWell, theyâ€™ll likely never realize that Arch is Catholic,â€ Roger said, rubbing his upper lip with a forefinger. â€œOr is he, come to that? Iâ€™ve never asked him.â€

â€œHe is,â€ Jamie said, very dryly. â€œBut heâ€™s lived long enough to ken when to be silent.â€

â€œWell, I can see this is going to be a jolly expedition,â€ Brianna said, raising one brow. â€œWhen do you think youâ€™ll be back?â€

â€œChrist, I donâ€™t know,â€ Roger said, feeling a stab of guilt at the casual blasphemy. Heâ€™d have to revise his habits, and quickly. â€œA month? Six weeks?â€

â€œAt least,â€ his father-in-law said cheerfully. â€œTheyâ€™ll be on foot, mind.â€

Roger took a deep breath, contemplating a slow march, en masse, from Cross Creek to the mountains, with Arch Bug on one side of him and Tom Christie on the other, twin pillars of taciturnity. His eyes lingered wistfully on his wife, envisioning six weeks of sleeping by the roadside, alone.

â€œYeah, fine,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™ll . . . um . . . go speak to Tom and Arch tonight, then.â€

â€œDaddy go?â€ Catching the gist of the conversation, Jem scrambled off his grandfatherâ€™s knee and scampered over to Roger, grabbing him round the leg. â€œGo with you, Daddy!â€

â€œOh. Well, I donâ€™t thinkâ€”â€ He caught sight of Breeâ€™s face, resigned, and then the green and red jar on the table behind her. â€œWhy not?â€ he said suddenly, and smiled at Jem. â€œGreat-Auntie Jocasta would love to see you. And Mummy can blow things up to her heartâ€™s content without worrying where you are, aye?â€

â€œShe can do what?â€ Jamie looked startled.

â€œIt doesnâ€™t explode,â€ Brianna said, picking up the jar of phosphorus and cradling it possessively. â€œIt just burns. Are you sure?â€ This last was addressed to Roger, and accompanied by a searching look.

â€œYeah, sure,â€ he said, affecting confidence. He glanced at Jemmy, who was chanting â€œGo! Go! Go!â€, meanwhile hopping up and down like a demented popcorn kernel. â€œAt least Iâ€™ll have someone to talk to on the way.â€

SAFE HANDS




IT WAS NEARLY DARK when Jamie came in to find me sitting at the kitchen table, head on my arms. I jerked upright at the sound of his footstep, blinking.

â€œAre ye all right, Sassenach?â€ He sat down on the opposite bench, eyeing me. â€œYe look as though yeâ€™ve been dragged through a hedge backward.â€

â€œOh.â€ I patted vaguely at my hair, which did seem to be sticking out a bit. â€œUm. Fine. Are you hungry?â€

â€œOf course I am. Have ye eaten, yourself?â€

I squinted and rubbed my face, trying to think.

â€œNo,â€ I decided at last. â€œI was waiting for you, but I seem to have fallen asleep. Thereâ€™s stew. Mrs. Bug left it.â€

He got up and peered into the small cauldron, then pushed the swinging hook back to bring it over the fire to warm.

â€œWhat have ye been doing, Sassenach?â€ he asked, coming back. â€œAnd howâ€™s the wee lass?â€

â€œThe wee lass is what Iâ€™ve been doing,â€ I said, suppressing a yawn. â€œMostly.â€ I rose, slowly, feeling my joints protest, and staggered over to the sideboard to cut some bread.

â€œShe couldnâ€™t keep it down,â€ I said. â€œThe gallberry medicine. Not that I blame her,â€ I added, cautiously licking my lower lip. After sheâ€™d thrown it up the first time, Iâ€™d tasted it myself. My tastebuds were still in a state of revolt; Iâ€™d never met a more aptly named plant, and being boiled into syrup had merely concentrated the flavor.

Jamie sniffed deeply as I turned.

â€œDid she vomit on ye?â€

â€œNo, that was Bobby Higgins,â€ I said. â€œHeâ€™s got hookworms.â€

He raised his brows.

â€œDo I want to hear about them whilst Iâ€™m eating?â€

â€œDefinitely not,â€ I said, sitting down with the loaf, a knife, and a crock of soft butter. I tore off a piece, buttered it thickly, and gave it to him, then took one for myself. My tastebuds hesitated, but wavered on the edge of forgiving me for the gallberry syrup.

â€œWhat have you been doing?â€ I asked, beginning to wake up enough to take notice. He seemed tired, but more cheerful than he had been when heâ€™d left the house.

â€œTalking to Roger Mac about Indians and Protestants.â€ He frowned at the half-eaten chunk of bread in his hand. â€œIs there something amiss wiâ€™ the bread, Sassenach? It tastes odd.â€

I waved a hand apologetically.

â€œSorry, thatâ€™s me. I washed several times, but I couldnâ€™t get it off completely. Perhaps youâ€™d better do the buttering.â€ I pushed the loaf toward him with my elbow, gesturing at the crock.

â€œCouldna get what off?â€

â€œWell, we tried and tried with the syrup, but no good; Lizzie simply couldnâ€™t hold it down, poor thing. But I remembered that quinine can be absorbed through the skin. So I mixed the syrup into some goose grease, and rubbed it all over her. Oh, yes, thanks.â€ I leaned forward and took a delicate bite of the buttered bit of bread he held out for me. My tastebuds gave in gracefully, and I realized that I hadnâ€™t eaten all day.

â€œAnd it worked?â€ He glanced up at the ceiling. Mr. Wemyss and Lizzie shared the smaller room upstairs, but all was quiet above.

â€œI think so,â€ I said, swallowing. â€œThe fever finally broke, at least, and sheâ€™s asleep. Weâ€™ll keep using it; if the fever doesnâ€™t come back in two days, weâ€™ll know it works.â€

â€œThatâ€™s good, then.â€

â€œWell, and then there was Bobby and his hookworms. Fortunately, I have some ipecacuanha and turpentine.â€

â€œFortunately for the worms, or for Bobby?â€

â€œWell, neither, really,â€ I said, and yawned. â€œIt will probably work, though.â€

He smiled faintly, and uncorked a bottle of beer, passing it automatically under his nose. Finding it all right, he poured some for me.

â€œAye, well, itâ€™s a comfort to know Iâ€™m leaving things in your capable hands, Sassenach. Ill-smelling,â€ he added, wrinkling his long nose in my direction, â€œbut capable.â€

â€œThanks so much.â€ The beer was better than good; must be one of Mrs. Bugâ€™s batches. We sipped companionably for a bit, both too tired to get up and serve the stew. I watched him beneath my lashes; I always did, when he was about to leave on a journey, storing up small memories of him against his return.

He looked tired, and there were small twin lines between his heavy brows, betokening slight worry. The candlelight glowed on the broad bones of his face, though, and cast his shadow clear on the plastered wall behind him, strong and bold. I watched the shadow raise its spectral beer glass, the light making an amber glow in the shadow glass.

â€œSassenach,â€ he said suddenly, putting down the glass, â€œhow many times, would ye say, have I come close to dying?â€

I stared at him for a moment, but then shrugged and began to reckon, mustering my synapses into reluctant activity.

â€œWell . . . I donâ€™t know what horrible things happened to you before I met you, but after . . . well, you were dreadfully ill at the abbey.â€ I glanced covertly at him, but he seemed not to be bothered at the thought of Wentworth prison, and what had been done to him there that had caused the illness. â€œHmm. And after Cullodenâ€”you said you had a terrible fever then, from your wounds, and thought you might die, only Jenny forced youâ€”I mean, nursed you through it.â€

â€œAnd then Laoghaire shot me,â€ he said wryly. â€œAnd you forced me through it. Likewise, when the snake bit me.â€ He considered for a moment.

â€œI had the smallpox when I was a wean, but I think I wasna in danger of dying then; they said it was a light case. So only four times, then.â€

â€œWhat about the day I first met you?â€ I objected. â€œYou nearly bled to death.â€

â€œOh, I did not,â€ he protested. â€œThat was no but a wee scratch.â€

I lifted one brow at him, and leaning over to the hearth, scooped a ladle of aromatic stew into a bowl. It was rich with the juices of rabbit and venison, swimming in a thick gravy spiced with rosemary, garlic, and onion. So far as my tastebuds were concerned, all was forgiven.

â€œHave it your way,â€ I said. â€œBut waitâ€”what about your head? When Dougal tried to kill you with an ax. Surely thatâ€™s five?â€

He frowned, accepting the bowl.

â€œAye, I suppose youâ€™re right,â€ he said, seeming displeased. â€œFive, then.â€

I regarded him gently over my own bowl of stew. He was very large, solid, and beautifully formed. And if he was a bit battered by circumstance, that merely added to his charm.

â€œYouâ€™re a very hard person to kill, I think,â€ I said. â€œThatâ€™s a great comfort to me.â€

He smiled, reluctant, but then reached out and lifted his glass in salute, touching it first to his own lips, then to mine.

â€œWeâ€™ll drink to that, Sassenach, shall we?â€

PEOPLE OF THE

SNOWBIRD




GUNS,â€ Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning said. â€œTell your King we want guns.â€

Jamie suppressed the urge to reply, â€œWho doesnâ€™t?â€ for a moment, but then gave in to it, surprising the war chief into a blink of startlement, followed by a grin.

â€œWho, indeed?â€ Bird was a short man, shaped like a barrel, and young for his officeâ€”but shrewd, his affability no disguise to his intelligence. â€œThey all tell you this, all the village war chiefs, eh? Of course they do. What do you tell them?â€

â€œWhat I can.â€ Jamie lifted one shoulder, let it fall. â€œTrade goods are certain, knives are likelyâ€”guns are possible, but I cannot yet promise them.â€

They were speaking a slightly unfamiliar dialect of Cherokee, and he hoped he had got right the manner of indicating probability. He did well enough with the usual tongue in casual matters of trade and hunting, but the matters he dealt in here would not be casual. He glanced briefly at Ian, who was listening closely, but evidently what heâ€™d said was all right. Ian visited the villages near the Ridge frequently, and hunted with the young men; he shifted into the tongue of the Tsalagi as easily as he did into his native Gaelic.

â€œSo, well enough.â€ Bird settled himself more comfortably. The pewter badge Jamie had given him as a present glinted on his breast, firelight flickering over the broadly amiable planes of his face. â€œTell your King about the gunsâ€”and tell him why we need them, eh?â€

â€œYou wish me to tell him that, do you? Do you think he will be willing to send you guns with which to kill his own people?â€ Jamie asked dryly. The incursion of white settlers across the Treaty Line into the Cherokee lands was a sore point, and he risked something by alluding to it directly, rather than addressing Birdâ€™s other needs for guns: to defend his village from raidersâ€”or to go raiding himself.

Bird shrugged in reply.

â€œWe can kill them without guns, if we want to.â€ One eyebrow lifted a little, and Birdâ€™s lips pursed, waiting to see what Jamie made of this statement.

He supposed Bird meant to shock him. He merely nodded.

â€œOf course you can. You are wise enough not to.â€

â€œNot yet.â€ Birdâ€™s lips relaxed into a charming smile. â€œYou tell the Kingâ€”not yet.â€

â€œHis Majesty will be pleased to hear that you value his friendship so much.â€

Bird burst into laughter at that, rocking back and forth, and his brother Still Water, who sat beside him, grinned broadly.

â€œI like you, Bear-Killer,â€ he said, recovering. â€œYouâ€™re a funny man.â€

â€œI may be,â€ Jamie said in English, smiling. â€œGive it time.â€

Ian gave a small snort of amusement at that, causing Bird to look sharply at him, then away, clearing his throat. Jamie raised one brow at his nephew, who replied with a bland smile.

Still Water was watching Ian narrowly. The Cherokee welcomed them both with respect, but Jamie had noticed at once a particular edge in their response to Ian. They perceived Ian to be Mohawkâ€”and he made them wary. In all honesty, he himself sometimes thought there was some part of Ian that had not come back from Snaketown, and perhaps never would.

Bird had given him an avenue to inquire about something, though.

â€œYou have been much troubled by persons who come into your lands to settle,â€ he said, nodding sympathetically. â€œYou of course do not kill these persons, being wise. But not everyone is wise, are they?â€

Birdâ€™s eyes narrowed briefly.

â€œWhat do you mean, Bear-Killer?â€

â€œI hear of burning, Tsisqua.â€ He held the other manâ€™s eyes with his own, careful to give no hint of accusation. â€œThe King hears of houses burning, men killed and women taken. This does not please him.â€

â€œHmp,â€ Bird said, and pressed his lips together. He did not, however, say he had not heard of such things himself, which was interesting.

â€œEnough of such stories, and the King may send soldiers to protect his people. If he should do that, he will hardly wish to have them face guns that he himself has given,â€ Jamie pointed out logically.

â€œAnd what should we do, then?â€ Still Water broke in hotly. â€œThey come across the Treaty Line, build houses, plant fields, and take the game. If your King cannot keep his people where they belong, how can he protest if we defend our lands?â€

Bird made a small flattening gesture with one hand, not looking at his brother, and Still Water subsided, though with bad grace.

â€œSo, Bear-Killer. You will tell the King these things, will you?â€

Jamie inclined his head gravely.

â€œThat is my office. I speak of the King to you, and I will take your words to the King.â€

Bird nodded thoughtfully, then waved a hand for food and beer, and the talk changed firmly to neutral matters. No more business would be done tonight.



IT WAS LATE when they left Tsisquaâ€™s house for the small guesthouse. He thought it was well past moonrise, but there was no moon to be seen; the sky glowed thick with cloud, and the scent of rain was live on the wind.

â€œOh, God,â€ Ian said, yawning and stumbling. â€œMy bumâ€™s gone asleep.â€

Jamie yawned, too, finding it contagious, but then blinked and laughed. â€œAye, well. Dinna bother waking it up; the rest of ye can join it.â€

Ian made a derisive noise with his lips.

â€œJust because Bird says yeâ€™re a funny man, Uncle Jamie, I wouldna go believing it. Heâ€™s only being polite, ken?â€

Jamie ignored this, murmuring thanks in Tsalagi to the young woman who had shown them the way to their quarters. She handed him a small basketâ€”filled with corn bread and dried apples, from the smellâ€”then wished them a soft â€œGood night, sleep well,â€ before vanishing into the damp, restless night.

The small hut seemed stuffy after the cool freshness of the air, and he stood in the doorway for a moment, enjoying the movement of the wind through the trees, watching it snake through the pine boughs like a huge, invisible serpent. A spatter of moisture bloomed on his face, and he experienced the deep pleasure of a man who realizes that itâ€™s going to rain and he isnâ€™t going to have to spend the night out in it.

â€œAsk about, Ian, when yeâ€™re gossiping tomorrow,â€ he said, ducking inside. â€œLet it be knownâ€”tactfullyâ€”that the King would be pleased to know exactly who in hellâ€™s been burning cabinsâ€”and might be pleased enough to cough up a few guns in reward. Theyâ€™ll not tell ye if itâ€™s them thatâ€™s been doing itâ€”but if itâ€™s another band, they might.â€

Ian nodded, yawning again. A small fire burned in a stone ring, the smoke of it wisping up toward a smoke hole in the roof overhead, and by its light, a fur-piled sleeping platform was visible across one side of the hut, with another stack of furs and blankets on the floor.

â€œToss ye for the bed, Uncle Jamie,â€ he said, digging in the pouch at his waist and coming out with a battered shilling. â€œCall it.â€

â€œTails,â€ Jamie said, setting down the basket and unbelting his plaid. It fell in a warm puddle of fabric round his legs and he shook out his shirt. The linen was creased and grimy against his skin, and he could smell himself; thank God this was the last of the villages. One more night, perhaps, two at the most, and they could go home.

Ian swore, picking up the coin.

â€œHow dâ€™ye do that? Every night yeâ€™ve said â€˜tails,â€™ and every night, tails it is!â€

â€œWell, itâ€™s your shilling, Ian. Dinna blame me.â€ He sat down on the bed platform and stretched himself pleasurably, then relented. â€œLook at Geordieâ€™s nose.â€

Ian flipped the shilling over in his fingers and held it to the light of the fire, squinting, then swore again. A tiny splotch of beeswax, so thin as to be invisible unless you were looking, ornamented the aristocratically prominent nose of George III, Rex Britannia.

â€œHow did that get there?â€ Ian narrowed his eyes suspiciously at his uncle, but Jamie merely laughed and lay down.

â€œWhen ye were showing wee Jem how to spin a coin. Remember, he knocked the candlestick over; hot wax went everywhere.â€

â€œOh.â€ Ian sat looking at the coin in his hand for a moment, then shook his head, scraped the wax away with a thumbnail, and put the shilling away.

â€œGood night, Uncle Jamie,â€ he said, sliding into the furs on the ground with a sigh.

â€œGood night, Ian.â€

Heâ€™d been ignoring his tiredness, holding it like Gideon, on a short rein. Now he dropped the reins and gave it leave to carry him off, his body relaxing into the comfort of the bed.

MacDonald, he reflected cynically, would be delighted. Jamie had planned on visits only to the two Cherokee villages closest to the Treaty Line, there to announce his new position, distribute modest gifts of whisky and tobaccoâ€”this last hastily borrowed from Tom Christie, who had fortunately purchased a hogshead of the weed on a seed-buying trip to Cross Creekâ€”and inform the Cherokee that further largesse might be expected when he undertook ambassage to the more distant villages in the autumn.

He had been most cordially received in both villagesâ€”but in the second, Pigtown, several strangers had been visiting; young men in search of wives. They were from a separate band of Cherokee, called the Snowbird band, whose large village lay higher in the mountains.

One of the young men had been the nephew of Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning, headman of the Snowbird band, and had been exigent in pressing Jamie to return with him and his companions to their home village. Taking a hasty private inventory of his remaining whisky and tobacco, Jamie had agreed, and he and Ian had been most royally received there, as agents of His Majesty. The Snowbird had never been visited by an Indian agent before, and appeared most sensible of the honorâ€”and prompt about seeing what advantages might accrue to themselves in consequence.

He thought Bird was the sort of man with whom he could do business, thoughâ€”on various fronts.

That thought led him to belated recollection of Roger Mac and the new tenants. Heâ€™d had no time over the last few days to spare much worry thereâ€”but he doubted there was any cause for concern. Roger Mac was capable enough, though his shattered voice made him less certain than he should be. With Christie and Arch Bug, though. . .

He closed his eyes, the bliss of absolute fatigue stealing over him as his thoughts grew more disjointed.

A day more, maybe, then home in time to make the hay. Another malting, two maybe, before the cold weather. Slaughtering . . . could it be time at last to kill the damned white sow? No . . . the vicious creature was unbelievably fecund. What kind of boar had the balls to mate with her? he wondered dimly, and did she eat him, after? Wild boar . . . smoked hams, blood pudding . . .

He was just drifting down through the first layers of sleep when he felt a hand on his privates. Jerked out of drowsiness like a salmon out of a sea-loch, he clapped a hand to the intruderâ€™s, gripping tight. And elicited a faint giggle from his visitor.

Feminine fingers wiggled gently in his grasp, and the handâ€™s fellow promptly took up operations in its stead. His first coherent thought was that the lassie would be an excellent baker, so good as she was at kneading.

Other thoughts followed rapidly on the heels of this absurdity, and he tried to grab the second hand. It playfully eluded him in the dark, poking and tweaking.

He groped for a polite protest in Cherokee, but came up with nothing but a handful of random phrases in English and Gaelic, none of them faintly suitable to the occasion.

The first hand was purposefully wriggling out of his grasp, eel-like. Reluctant to crush her fingers, he let go for an instant, and made a successful grab for her wrist.

â€œIan!â€ he hissed, in desperation. â€œIan, are ye there?â€ He couldnâ€™t see his nephew in the pool of darkness that filled the cabin, nor tell if he slept. There were no windows, and only the faintest light came from the dying coals.

â€œIan!â€

There was a stirring on the floor, bodies shifting, and he heard Rollo sneeze.

â€œWhat is it, Uncle?â€ Heâ€™d spoken in Gaelic, and Ian answered in the same language. The lad sounded calm, and not as though heâ€™d just come awake.

â€œIan, there is a woman in my bed,â€ he said in Gaelic, trying to match his nephewâ€™s calm tone.

â€œThere are two of them, Uncle Jamie.â€ Ian sounded amused, damn him! â€œThe other will be down by your feet. Waiting her turn.â€

That unnerved him, and he nearly lost his grip on the captive hand.

â€œTwo of them! What do they think I am?â€

The girl giggled again, leaned over, and bit him lightly on the chest.

â€œChrist!â€

â€œWell, no, Uncle, they donâ€™t think youâ€™re Him,â€ Ian said, obviously suppressing his own mirth. â€œThey think youâ€™re the King. So to speak. Youâ€™re his agent, so theyâ€™re doing honor to His Majesty by sending you his women, aye?â€

The second woman had uncovered his feet and was slowly stroking his soles with one finger. He was ticklish and would have found this bothersome, were he not so distracted by the first woman, with whom he was being compelled into a most undignified game of hide-the-sausage.

â€œTalk to them, Ian,â€ he said between clenched teeth, fumbling madly with his free hand, meanwhile forcing back the questing fingers of the captive handâ€”which were languidly stroking his earâ€”and wiggling his feet in a frantic effort to discourage the second ladyâ€™s attentions, which were growing bolder.

â€œErm . . . what dâ€™ye want me to say?â€ Ian inquired, switching back to English. His voice quivered slightly.

â€œTell them Iâ€™m deeply sensible of the honor, butâ€”gk!â€ Further diplomatic evasions were cut off by the sudden intrusion of someoneâ€™s tongue into his mouth, tasting strongly of onions and beer.

In the midst of his subsequent struggles, he was dimly aware that Ian had lost any sense of self-control and was lying on the floor giggling helplessly. It was filicide if you killed a son, he thought grimly; what was the word for assassinating a nephew?

â€œMadam!â€ he said, disengaging his mouth with difficulty. He seized the lady by the shoulders and rolled her off his body with enough force that she whooped with surprise, bare legs flyingâ€”Jesus, was she naked?

She was. Both of them were; his eyes adapted to the faint glow of the embers, he caught the shimmer of light from shoulders, breasts, and rounded thighs.

He sat up, gathering furs and blankets round him in a sort of hasty redoubt.

â€œCease, the two of you!â€ he said severely in Cherokee. â€œYou are beautiful, but I cannot lie with you.â€

â€œNo?â€ said one, sounding puzzled.

â€œWhy not?â€ said the other.

â€œAh . . . because there is an oath upon me,â€ he said, necessity producing inspiration. â€œI have sworn . . . sworn . . .â€ He groped for the proper word, but didnâ€™t find it. Luckily, Ian leaped in at this point, with a stream of fluent Tsalagi, too fast to follow.

â€œOoo,â€ breathed one girl, impressed. Jamie felt a distinct qualm.

â€œWhat in Godâ€™s name did ye tell them, Ian?â€

â€œI told them the Great Spirit came to ye in a dream, Uncle, and told ye that ye mustnâ€™t go with a woman until yeâ€™d brought guns to all the Tsalagi.â€

â€œUntil I what?!â€

â€œWell, it was the best I could think of in a hurry, Uncle,â€ Ian said defensively.

Hair-raising as the notion was, he had to admit it was effective; the two women were huddled together, whispering in awed tones, and had quite left off pestering him.

â€œAye, well,â€ he said grudgingly. â€œI suppose it could be worse.â€ After all, even if the Crown were persuaded to provide guns, there were a damn lot of Tsalagi.

â€œYeâ€™re welcome, Uncle Jamie.â€ The laughter was gurgling just below the surface of his nephewâ€™s voice, and emerged in a stifled snort.

â€œWhat?â€ he said testily.

â€œThe one lady is saying itâ€™s a disappointment to her, Uncle, because youâ€™re verra nicely equipped. The other is more philosophical about it, though. She says they might have borne ye children, and the bairns might have red hair.â€ His nephewâ€™s voice quivered.

â€œWhatâ€™s wrong wiâ€™ red hair, for Godâ€™s sake?â€

â€œI dinna ken, quite, but I gather itâ€™s not something ye want your bairn to be marked with, and ye can help it.â€

â€œWell, fine,â€ he snapped. â€œNo danger of it, is there? Can they not go home now?â€

â€œItâ€™s raining, Uncle Jamie,â€ Ian pointed out logically. It was; the wind had brought a patter of rain, and now the main shower arrived, beating on the roof with a steady thrum, drops hissing into the hot embers through the smoke hole. â€œYe wouldna send them out in the wet, would ye? Besides, ye just said ye couldna lie wiâ€™ them, not that ye meant them to go.â€

He broke off to say something interrogative to the ladies, who replied with eager confidence. Jamie thought theyâ€™d saidâ€”they had. Rising with the grace of young cranes, the two of them clambered naked as jaybirds back into his bed, patting and stroking him with murmurs of admirationâ€”though sedulously avoiding his private partsâ€”pressed him down into the furs, and snuggled down on either side of him, warm bare flesh pressed cozily against him.

He opened his mouth, then shut it again, finding absolutely nothing to say in any of the languages he knew.

He lay on his back, rigid and breathing shallowly. His cock throbbed indignantly, clearly meaning to stay up and torment him all night in revenge for its abuse. Small chortling noises came from the pile of furs on the ground, interspersed with hiccuping snorts. He thought it was maybe the first time heâ€™d heard Ian truly laugh since his return.

Praying for fortitude, he drew a long, slow breath, and closed his eyes, hands folded firmly across his ribs, elbows pressed to his sides.

STAKIT TO DROON




ROGER WALKED OUT ONTO the terrace at River Run, feeling pleasantly exhausted. After three weeks of strenuous work, heâ€™d gathered the new tenants from the highways and byways of Cross Creek and Campbelton, become acquainted with all the heads of households, managed to equip them at least minimally for the journey, in terms of food, blankets, and shoesâ€”and got them all collected in one place, firmly overcoming their tendency to panic and stray. Theyâ€™d start in the morning for Fraserâ€™s Ridge, and not a moment too soon.

He looked out over the terrace in satisfaction, toward the meadow that lay beyond Jocasta Cameron Innesâ€™s stables. They were all bedded down in a temporary camp there: twenty-two families, with seventy-six individual souls, four mules, two ponies, fourteen dogs, three pigs, and God only knew how many chickens, kittens, and pet birds, bundled into wicker cages for carrying. He had all the names on a listâ€”animals excludedâ€”dog-eared and crumpled in his pocket. He had several other lists there, as well, scribbled over, crossed out, and amended to the point of illegibility. He felt like a walking Book of Deuteronomy. He also felt like a very large drink.

This was luckily forthcoming; Duncan Innes, Jocastaâ€™s husband, had returned from his own dayâ€™s labor and was sitting on the terrace, in company with a cut-glass decanter, from which the rays of the sinking sun struck a mellow amber glow.

â€œHow is it, then, a charaid?â€ Duncan greeted him genially, gesturing toward one of the basketwork chairs. â€œYeâ€™ll take a dram, perhaps?â€

â€œI will, and thanks.â€

He sank gratefully into the chair, which creaked amiably beneath his weight. He accepted the glass Duncan handed him, and tossed it back with a brief â€œSlÃ inte.â€

The whisky burned through the strictures that bound his throat, making him cough, but seeming suddenly to open things, so that the constant faint sense of choking began to leave him. He sipped, grateful.

â€œReady to go, are they?â€ Duncan nodded toward the meadow, where the smoke of campfires hung in a low golden haze.

â€œReady as theyâ€™ll ever be. Poor things,â€ Roger added with some sympathy.

Duncan raised one shaggy brow.

â€œFish out of water,â€ Roger amplified, holding out his glass to accept the proffered refill. â€œThe women are terrified, and so are the men, but they hide it better. Yeâ€™d think I was taking them all to be slaves on a sugar plantation.â€

Duncan nodded. â€œOr sell them to Rome to clean the Popeâ€™s shoon,â€ he said wryly. â€œI misdoubt most of them had ever smelt a Catholic before embarking. And from the wrinkled noses, they dinna care so much for the scent now, I think. Do they so much as takâ€™ a dram now and then, dâ€™ye ken?â€

â€œOnly medicinally, and only if in actual danger of death, I think.â€ Roger took a slow, ambrosial swallow and closed his eyes, feeling the whisky warm his throat and curl in his chest like a purring cat. â€œMeet Hiram yet, did you? Hiram Crombie, the head man of this lot.â€

â€œThe wee sour-drap wiâ€™ the stick up his arse? Aye, I met him.â€ Duncan grinned, his drooping mustache lifting at the end. â€œHeâ€™ll be at supper with us. Best have another.â€

â€œI will, thanks,â€ said Roger, extending his glass. â€œThough theyâ€™re none of them much for hedonistic pleasure, so far as I can tell. Yeâ€™d think they were all still Covenanters to the bone. The Frozen Chosen, aye?â€

Duncan laughed immoderately at that.

â€œWell, itâ€™s no like it was in my grandsireâ€™s day,â€ he said, recovering and reaching across for the decanter. â€œAnd thank the Lord for that.â€ He rolled his eyes, grimacing.

â€œYour grandsire was a Covenanter, then?â€

â€œGod, yes.â€ Shaking his head, Duncan poured a goodly measure, first for Roger, then himself. â€œA fierce auld bastard, he was. Not that heâ€™d no cause, mind. His sister was stakit to droon, ken?â€

â€œWasâ€”Christ.â€ He bit his tongue in penance, but was too interested to pay it much mind. â€œYe meanâ€”executed by drowning?â€

Duncan nodded, eyes on his glass, then took a good gulp and held it for a moment in his mouth before swallowing.

â€œMargaret,â€ he said. â€œHer name was Margaret. Eighteen she was, at the time. Her father and her brotherâ€”my grandfather, aye?â€”theyâ€™d fled, after the battle at Dunbar; hid in the hills. The troops came a-hunting them, but she wouldna say where theyâ€™d goneâ€”and she had a Bible by her. They tried to make her recant then, but she wouldna do that, eitherâ€”the women on that side oâ€™ the family, ye might as well talk to a stone,â€ he said, shaking his head. â€œThereâ€™s no moving them. But they dragged her doon to the shore, her and an auld Covenanter woman from the village, stripped them, and tied them both to stakes at the tide line. Waited there, the crowd oâ€™ them, for the water to come in.â€

He took another swallow, not waiting for the taste of it.

â€œThe auld woman went under first; theyâ€™d tied her closer to the waterâ€”I suppose thinking Margaret would give in, if she saw the auld woman die.â€ He grunted, shaking his head. â€œBut nay, not a bit of it. The tide rose, and the waves came up ower her. She choked, and she coughed, and her hair loose, hanging over her face, plastered doon like kelp, when the water went out.

â€œMy mither saw it,â€ he explained, lifting his glass. â€œShe was but seven at the time, but she never forgot. After the first wave, she said, there was the space of three breaths, and the wave came ower Margaret again. And then out . . . three breaths . . . and in again once more. And ye couldna see anything then but the swirl of her hair, floating on the tide.â€

He raised his glass an inch higher, and Roger lifted his own in involuntary toast. â€œJesus,â€ he said, and it was no blasphemy.

The whisky burned his throat as it went down and he breathed deep, giving thanks to God for the gift of air. Three breaths. It was the single malt of Islay, and the iodine taste of sea and kelp was strong and smoky in his lungs.

â€œMay God give her peace,â€ he said, his voice rasping.

Duncan nodded, and reached again for the decanter.

â€œI would suppose she earned it,â€ he said. â€œThough theyâ€â€”he pointed with his chin toward the meadowâ€”â€œtheyâ€™d say â€™twas none of her doing at all; God chose her for salvation and chose the English to be damned; nay more to be said on the matter.â€

The light was fading and the campfires began to glow in the dimness of the meadow beyond the stables. The smoke of them reached Rogerâ€™s nose, the scent warm and homelike, but nonetheless adding to the burn in his throat.

â€œIâ€™ve no found sae much worth dyinâ€™ for, myself,â€ Duncan said reflectively, then gave one of his quick, rare smiles. â€œBut my grandsire, heâ€™d say it only meant I was chosen to be damned. â€˜By the decree of God, for His everlasting glory, some men and angels are predestined unto everlasting life, and others fore-ordained to everlasting death.â€™ Heâ€™d say that, whenever anyone spoke of Margaret.â€

Roger nodded, recognizing the statement from the Westminster Confession. When was thatâ€”1646? 1647? A generationâ€”or twoâ€”before Duncanâ€™s grandfather.

â€œI expect it was easier for him to think her death was Godâ€™s will, and nothing to do with him,â€ Roger said, not without sympathy. â€œYeâ€™ll not believe it yourself, then? Predestination, I mean.â€

He asked with true curiosity. The Presbyterians of his own time did still espouse predestination as a doctrineâ€”but, a bit more flexible in attitude, tended to soft-pedal the notion of predestined damnation, and not to think too much on the idea that every detail of life was so predestined. Himself? God knew.

Duncan lifted his shoulders, the right rising higher and making him seem momentarily twisted. â€œGod knows,â€ he said, and laughed. He shook his head, and drained his glass again.

â€œNay, I think I donâ€™t. But I wouldna say as much before Hiram Crombieâ€”nor yet yon Christie.â€ Duncan lifted his chin toward the meadow, where he could see two dark figures, walking side by side toward the house. Arch Bugâ€™s tall, stooped frame was easy to recognize, as was Tom Christieâ€™s shorter, blocky build. He looked pugnacious even in silhouette, Roger thought, making short, sharp gestures as he walked, clearly arguing something with Arch.

â€œThereâ€™d be wicked fights ower it sometimes, in Ardsmuir,â€ Duncan said, watching the progress of the two figures. â€œThe Catholics took it amiss, to be told they were damned. And Christie and his wee band took the greatest pleasure in telling them so.â€ His shoulders shook a little in suppressed laughter, and Roger wondered just how much whisky Duncan had had before he came out to the terrace. Heâ€™d never seen the older man so jovial.

â€œMac Dubh put a stop to it, finally, when he made us all be Freemasons,â€ he added, leaning forward to pour a fresh glass. â€œBut a few men were nearly killed, before that.â€ He lifted the decanter inquiringly in Rogerâ€™s direction.

Looking forward to a supper including both Tom Christie and Hiram Crombie, Roger accepted.

As Duncan leaned toward him to pour, still smiling, the last of the sun shone across his weathered face. Roger caught a glimpse of a faint white line through Duncanâ€™s upper lip, half-visible beneath the hair, and realized quite suddenly why Duncan wore a long mustacheâ€”an unusual adornment, in a time when most men were clean-shaven.

He would not have spoken, likely, save for the whisky and the mood of strange alliance between themâ€”two Protestants, amazingly bound to Catholics and bemused at the strange tides of fate that had washed over them; two men left quite alone by the misfortunes of life, and now surprised to find themselves the heads of households, holding the lives of strangers in their hands.

â€œYour lip, Duncan.â€ He touched his own mouth briefly. â€œWhat did that?â€

â€œOch, that?â€ Duncan touched his own lip, surprised. â€œNay, I was born wiâ€™ a harelip, or so they said. I dinna recall it, myself; it was mended when I was nay more than a week old.â€

It was Rogerâ€™s turn to be surprised.

â€œWho mended it?â€

Duncan shrugged, one-shouldered this time.

â€œA traveling healer, my mither said. Sheâ€™d quite resigned herself to losinâ€™ me, she said, because I couldna suck, of course. She and my aunties all took it in turn to drap milk into my mouth from a rag, but she said Iâ€™d wasted nearly to a wee skeleton, when this charmer came by the village.â€

He rubbed a knuckle self-consciously over his lip, smoothing the thick, grizzled hairs of his mustache.

â€œMy faither gave him six herrings and a mull oâ€™ snuff, and he stitched it up, and gave my mither a bit oâ€™ some ointment to put on the wound. Well, and so . . .â€ He shrugged again, with a lopsided smile.

â€œPerhaps I was destined to live, after all. My grandsire said the Lord had chosen meâ€”though God only kens what for.â€

Roger was conscious of a faint ripple of unease, dulled though it was by whisky.

A Highland charmer who could repair a harelip? He took another drink, trying not to stare, but covertly examining Duncanâ€™s face. He supposed it was possible; the scar was just barely visibleâ€”if you knew to lookâ€”under Duncanâ€™s mustache, but didnâ€™t extend up into the nostril. It must have been a fairly simple harelip, then, not one of the hideous cases like that one heâ€™d read aboutâ€”unable to look away from the page for horrorâ€”in Claireâ€™s big black doctorâ€™s book, where Dr. Rawlings had described a child born not only with a split lip, but missing the roof of its mouth, and most of the center of its face, as well.

There had been no drawing, thank God, but the visual picture conjured up by Rawlingsâ€™s spare description had been bad enough. He closed his eyes and breathed deep, inhaling the whiskyâ€™s perfume through his pores.

Was it possible? Perhaps. People did do surgery now, bloodstained, crude, and agonizing as it was. Heâ€™d seen Murray MacLeod, the apothecary from Campbelton, expertly stitch up a manâ€™s cheek, laid open when the man was trampled by a sheep. Would it be any more difficult to stitch a childâ€™s mouth?

He thought of Jemmyâ€™s lip, tender as a blossom, pierced by needle and black thread, and shuddered.

â€œAre ye cold, then, a charaid? Shall we go in?â€ Duncan got his feet under him, as though to rise, but Roger waved the older man back.

â€œAh, no. Goose walking on my grave.â€ He smiled, and accepted another drop to keep the nonexistent evening chill away. And yet he felt the hairs on his arms rise, just a little. Could there be another oneâ€”moreâ€”like us?

There had been, he knew. His own multiple-times great-grandmother, Geillis, for one. The man whose skull Claire had found, complete with silver fillings in its teeth, for another. But had Duncan met another, in some remote Highland village half a century before?

Christ, he thought, freshly unnerved. How often does it happen? And what happens to them?

Before they had quite reached the bottom of the decanter, he heard footsteps behind him, and the rustle of silk.

â€œMrs. Cameron.â€ He rose at once, the world tilting just a little, and took his hostessâ€™s hand, bowing over it.

Her long hand touched his face, as was her habit, her sensitive fingertips confirming his identity.

â€œOch, there ye are, Jo. Had a good journey wiâ€™ the wee lad, did ye?â€ Duncan struggled to rise, handicapped by whisky and his single arm, but Ulysses, Jocastaâ€™s butler, had materialized silently out of the twilight behind his mistress in time to move her wicker chair into place. She sank into it without so much as putting a hand out to see that it was there, Roger noticed; she simply knew it would be.

Roger viewed the butler with interest, wondering who Jocasta had bribed to get him back. Accusedâ€”and very likely guilty ofâ€”the death of a British naval officer on Jocastaâ€™s property, Ulysses had been forced to flee the colony. But Lieutenant Wolff had not been considered a great loss to the navyâ€”and Ulysses was indispensable to Jocasta Cameron. All things might not be possible with goldâ€”but he was willing to bet that Jocasta Cameron hadnâ€™t yet met a circumstance she couldnâ€™t mend with money, political connections, or guile.

â€œOh, aye,â€ she replied to her husband, smiling and putting out a hand to him. â€œâ€™Twas such fun to show him off, husband! Weâ€™d a wonderful luncheon with old Mrs. Forbes and her daughter, and the wee bairn sang a song and charmed them all. Mrs. Forbes had the Montgomery lasses in, as well, and Miss Ogilvie, and we had wee lamb cutlets wiâ€™ raspberry sauce and fried apples andâ€”oh, is that you, Mr. Christie? Do come and join us!â€ She raised her voice a little, and her face, appearing to look expectantly into the gloom over Rogerâ€™s shoulder.

â€œMrs. Cameron. Your servant, madam.â€ Christie stepped up onto the terrace, making a courtly bow that was no less punctilious for the fact that its recipient was blind. Arch Bug followed him, bowing in turn over Jocastaâ€™s hand, and making a genial noise in his throat by way of greeting.

Chairs were brought out, more whisky, a plate of savories appeared as by magic, candles were litâ€”and suddenly it was a party, echoing on a higher plane the sense of slightly nervous festivity taking place in the meadow below. There was music in the distance; the sound of a tin whistle, playing a jig.

Roger let it all wash over him, enjoying the brief sense of relaxation and irresponsibility. Just for tonight, there was no need to worry; everyone was gathered, safe, fed, and prepared for the morrowâ€™s journey.

He neednâ€™t even trouble to keep up his end of the conversation; Tom Christie and Jocasta were enthusiastically discussing the literary scene in Edinburgh and a book heâ€™d never heard of, with Duncan, looking so mellow that he might slide out of his chair any minute, putting in the occasional remark, and old Archâ€”where was Arch? Oh, there; gone back toward the meadow, having doubtless thought of some last minute thing he must tell someone.

He blessed Jamie Fraser for his forethought in sending Arch and Tom with him. Between the two of them, theyâ€™d saved him from any number of blunders, managed the ten thousand necessary details, and eased the fears of the new tenants regarding this latest leap into the unknown.

He took a deep, contented breath of air scented with the homely smells of campfires in the distance and roasting dinner near at handâ€”and belatedly recalled the one small detail whose welfare was still his exclusive concern.

Excusing himself, he made his way into the house, and discovered Jem down below in the main kitchen, cozily ensconced in the corner of a settle, eating bread pudding with melted butter and maple syrup on it.

â€œThatâ€™s never your dinner, is it?â€ he asked, sitting down beside his son.

â€œUh-huh. Want some, Daddy?â€ Jem extended a dripping spoon upward toward him, and he bent hastily to take the offered mouthful before it fell off. It was delicious, bursting-sweet and creamy on the tongue.

â€œMmm,â€ he said, swallowing. â€œWell, letâ€™s not tell Mummy or Grannie, shall we? Theyâ€™ve this odd prejudice toward meat and vegetables.â€

Jem nodded, agreeable, and offered him another spoonful. They consumed the bowl together in a companionable silence, after which Jem crawled into his lap, and leaning a sticky face against his chest, fell sound asleep.

Servants bustled to and fro around them, smiling kindly now and then. He should, he thought vaguely, get up. Dinner would be being served in a momentâ€”he saw the platters of roasted duck and mutton being skillfully laid out, bowls mounded with heaps of fluffy, steaming rice soaked with gravy, and a huge sallet of greens being tossed with vinegar.

Filled with whisky, bread pudding, and contentment, though, he lingered, putting off from moment to moment the necessity of parting from Jem and ending the sweet peace of holding his sleeping son.

â€œMister Roger? I take him, shall I?â€ said a soft voice. He looked up from an examination of Jemâ€™s hair, which had bits of bread pudding stuck in it, to see Phaedre, Jocastaâ€™s body servant, stooping before him, hands held out to receive the boy.

â€œI wash him, put him to his bed, sir,â€ she said, her oval face as soft as her voice as she looked at Jem.

â€œOh. Yes, sure. Thanks.â€ Roger sat up, Jem in his arms, and rose carefully, holding Jemâ€™s considerable weight. â€œHereâ€”Iâ€™ll carry him up for you.â€

He followed the slave up the narrow stairs from the kitchen, admiringâ€”in a purely abstract and aesthetic sort of wayâ€”the grace of her carriage. How old was she? he wondered. Twenty, twenty-two? Would Jocasta allow her to marry? She must have admirers, surely. But he knew how valuable she was to Jocasta, tooâ€”seldom out of her mistressâ€™s presence. Not easy to reconcile that with a home and family of her own.

At the top of the stair, she stopped and turned to take Jem from him; he surrendered his limp burden with reluctance, but also with some relief. It was stifling-hot down below, and his shirt was damp with sweat where Jem had pressed against him.

â€œMister Roger?â€ Phaedreâ€™s voice stopped him, as he was about to take his leave. She was looking at him over Jemâ€™s shoulder, eyes hesitant beneath the white curve of her head scarf.

â€œAye?â€

The thump of feet coming up the stairs made him move, narrowly avoiding Oscar, charging upstairs with an empty platter under his arm, evidently bound for the summer kitchen, where the fish were being fried. Oscar grinned at Roger as he passed, and blew a kiss toward Phaedre, whose lips tightened at the gesture.

She made a slight motion with her head, and Roger followed her down the hall, away from the bustle of the kitchen. She stopped near the door that led out to the stables, glancing round to be sure they were not overheard.

â€œI maybe shouldnâ€™t say nothinâ€™, sirâ€”may be as it is nothinâ€™. But Iâ€™m thinkinâ€™ I should tell you, anyway.â€

He nodded, shoving back the damp hair at his temple. The door stood open, and there was a little breeze here, thank God.

â€œWe was in the town, sir, this morning, at Mr. Benjaminâ€™s warehouse, you know the one? Down by the river.â€

He nodded again, and she licked her lips.

â€œMaster Jem, he got restless and went to pokinâ€™ round, whilst the mistress talked with Mr. Benjamin. I followed him, seeinâ€™ as he falls into no trouble, and so I was right there when the man come in.â€

â€œAye? Which man was this?â€

She shook her head, dark eyes serious.

â€œI dunno, sir. Was a big man, tall as you. Light-haired; he wasnâ€™t wearinâ€™ no wig. Was a gentleman, though.â€ By which, he assumed, she meant the man was well-dressed.

â€œAnd?â€

â€œHe looks round, sees Mr. Benjamin a-talkinâ€™ with Miss Jo, and he takes a step to the side, like as he donâ€™t want no one takinâ€™ notice he there. But then he sees Mr. Jem, and he get a sharp kind of look on his face.â€

She pulled Jem a little closer, recalling.

â€œI ainâ€™t likinâ€™ that look, sir, tell you truly. I see him start toward Jemmy and I go quick and pick the lad up, same as I got him now. The man look surprised, then like he think somethingâ€™s funny; he smile at Jem and ax him who his daddy be?â€

She gave a quick smile, patting Jemâ€™s back.

â€œFolk ax him that all the time, sir, downtown, and he speak right up, say his daddy Roger MacKenzie, same as he always do. This man, he laugh and ruffle Jemâ€™s hairâ€”they all do that, sir, he gots such pretty hair. Then he say, â€˜Is he, then, my wee maneen, is he indeed?â€™â€

Phaedre was a natural mimic. She caught the Irish lilt of it perfectly, and the sweat turned cold on Rogerâ€™s skin.

â€œAnd then what happened?â€ he demanded. â€œWhat did he do?â€ Unconsciously, he glanced over her shoulder through the open door, searching the night outside for danger.

Phaedre hunched her shoulders, shivering slightly.

â€œHe ainâ€™t do nothinâ€™, sir. But he look at Jem real close, and then at me, and he smile, right in my eyes. I ainâ€™t likinâ€™ that smile, sir, not one bit.â€ She shook her head. â€œBut then I hear Mr. Benjamin lift his voice behind me, callinâ€™ out to say does the gentleman want him? And the man turn quick-like on his heel, and be gone out the door, just like that.â€ She clutched Jem with one arm, and snapped the fingers of her free hand briefly.

â€œI see.â€ The bread pudding had formed a solid mass that lay like iron in his stomach. â€œDid you say anything to your mistress about this man?â€

She shook her head, solemn.

â€œNo, sir. He ainâ€™t really done nothinâ€™, like I say. But he trouble me, sir, and so I study on it, cominâ€™ home, and think finally, well, I best tell you, sir, and I gets the chance.â€

â€œYe did right,â€ he said. â€œThank you, Phaedre.â€ He fought the urge to take Jem from her, hold him tight. â€œWould yeâ€”when yeâ€™ve got him to bed, will ye stay with him? Just until I come up. Iâ€™ll tell your mistress I asked you to.â€

Her dark eyes met his with perfect understanding, and she nodded.

â€œAye, sir. I keep him safe.â€ She bobbed the shadow of a curtsy, and went up the stairs toward the room he shared with Jem, humming something soft and rhythmic to the boy.

He breathed slowly, trying to master the overwhelming urge to seize a horse from the stables, ride to Cross Creek, and search the place, going from house to house in the dark until he found Stephen Bonnet.

â€œRight,â€ he said aloud. â€œAnd then what?â€ His fists curled up involuntarily, knowing quite well what to do, even as his mind acknowledged the futility of such a course.

He fought down rage and helplessness, the last of the whisky lighting his blood, throbbing in his temples. He stepped abruptly through the open door into the night, for it was full dark now. From this side of the house, the meadow was invisible, but he could still smell the smoke of their fires, and catch the faint trill of music on the air.

Heâ€™d known Bonnet would come again, one day. Down beside the lawn, the white bulk of Hector Cameronâ€™s mausoleum was a pale smear on the night. And safe inside it, hidden in the coffin that waited for Hectorâ€™s wife, Jocasta, lay a fortune in Jacobite gold, the long-held secret of River Run.

Bonnet knew the gold existed, suspected it was on the plantation. He had tried for it once before, and failed. He was not a careful man, Bonnetâ€”but he was persistent.

Roger felt his bones strain in his flesh, urgent with desire to hunt and kill the man who had raped his wife, threatened his family. But there were seventy-six people depending on himâ€”no, seventy-seven. Vengeance warred with responsibilityâ€”and, most reluctantly, gave way.

He breathed slow and deep, feeling the knot of the rope scar tighten in his throat. No. He had to go, see the new tenants safe. The thought of sending them with Arch and Tom, while he remained behind to search for Bonnet, was temptingâ€”but the job was his; he couldnâ€™t abandon it for the sake of a time-consumingâ€”and likely futileâ€”personal quest.

Nor could he leave Jem unprotected.

He must tell Duncan, though; Duncan could be trusted to take steps for the protection of River Run, to send word to the authorities in Cross Creek, to make inquiries.

And Roger would make sure that Jem was safe away, too, come morning, held before him on his saddle, kept in his sight every inch of the way to the sanctuary of the mountains.

â€œWhoâ€™s your daddy?â€ he muttered, and a fresh surge of rage pulsed through his veins. â€œGod damn it, I am, you bastard!â€

LE MOT JUSTE




August 1773

YEâ€™RE SMILING TO yourself,â€ Jamie said in my ear. â€œNice, was it?â€

I turned my head and opened my eyes, finding them on a level with his mouthâ€”which was smiling, too.

â€œNice,â€ I said thoughtfully, tracing the line of his wide lower lip with the tip of one finger. â€œAre you being deliberately modest, or are you hoping to inspire me to raptures of praise by means of classic understatement?â€

The mouth widened further, and his teeth closed gently on my questing finger for a moment before releasing it.

â€œOh, modesty, to be sure,â€ he said. â€œIf Iâ€™d hopes of inspiring ye to raptures, it wouldna be with my words, now, would it?â€

One hand ran lightly down my back in illustration.

â€œWell, the words help,â€ I said.

â€œThey do?â€

â€œYes. Just now, I was actually trying to rank â€˜I love you, I like you, I worship you, I have to have my cock inside you,â€™ in terms of their relative sincerity.â€

â€œDid I say that?â€ he said, sounding slightly startled.

â€œYes. Werenâ€™t you listening?â€

â€œNo,â€ he admitted. â€œI meant every word of it, though.â€ His hand cupped one buttock, weighing it appreciatively. â€œStill do, come to that.â€

â€œWhat, even the last one?â€ I laughed and rubbed my forehead gently against his chest, feeling his jaw rest snugly on top of my head.

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said, gathering me firmly against him with a sigh. â€œI will say the flesh requires a bit of supper and a wee rest before I think of doinâ€™ it again, but the spirit is always willing. God, ye have the sweetest fat wee bum. Only seeing it makes me want to give it ye again directly. Itâ€™s lucky yeâ€™re wed to a decrepit auld man, Sassenach, or yeâ€™d be on your knees with your arse in the air this minute.â€

He smelled delectably of road dust and dried sweat and the deep musk of a man who has just enjoyed himself thoroughly.

â€œNice to be missed,â€ I said contentedly into the small space beneath his arm. â€œI missed you, too.â€

My breath tickled him and his skin shivered suddenly, like a horse shedding flies. He shifted a bit, turning me so that my head fit into the hollow of his shoulder, and sighed in matching content.

â€œWell, so. I see the place is still standing.â€

It was. It was late afternoon, the windows open, and the sun came low through the trees to make shifting patterns on the walls and linen sheets, so that we floated in a bower of murmuring shadow leaves.

â€œThe house is standing, the barley is mostly in, and nothingâ€™s died,â€ I said, settling myself comfortably to report. Now that weâ€™d taken care of the most important thing, heâ€™d want to know how the Ridge had fared in his absence.

â€œMostly?â€ he said, neatly catching the dicey bit. â€œWhat happened? It rained, aye, but the barley should all have been in a week before.â€

â€œNot rain. Grasshoppers.â€ I shuddered in memory. A cloud of the nasty goggle-eyed things had come whirring through, just at the end of the barley harvest. Iâ€™d gone up to my garden to pick greens, only to discover said greens seething with wedge-shaped bodies and shuffling, clawed feet, my lettuces and cabbages gnawed to ragged nubbins and the morning-glory vine on the palisade hanging in shreds.

â€œI ran and got Mrs. Bug and Lizzie, and we drove them off with broomsâ€”but then they all rose up in a big cloud and headed up through the wood to the field beyond the Green Spring. They settled in the barley; you could hear the chewing for miles. It sounded like giants walking through rice.â€ Goosebumps of revulsion rose on my shoulders, and Jamie rubbed my skin absently, his hand large and warm.

â€œMmphm. Was it only the one field they got, then?â€

â€œOh, yes.â€ I took a deep breath, still smelling the smoke. â€œWe torched the field, and burnt them alive.â€

His body jerked in surprise, and he looked down at me.

â€œWhat? Who thought of that?â€

â€œI did,â€ I said, not without pride. In cold-blooded retrospect, it was a sensible thing to have done; there were other fields at risk, not only of barley, but of ripening corn, wheat, potatoes, and hayâ€”to say nothing of the garden patches most families depended on.

In actual fact, it had been a decision made in boiling rageâ€”sheer, bloody-minded revenge for the destruction of my garden. I would happily have ripped the wings off each insect and stamped on the remainsâ€”burning them had been nearly as good, though.

It was Murdo Lindsayâ€™s field; slow in both thought and action, Murdo hadnâ€™t had time to react properly to my announcement that I meant to fire the barley, and was still standing on the stoop of his cabin, mouth hanging open, as Brianna, Lizzie, Marsali, Mrs. Bug, and I ran round the field with armsful of faggots, lighting them from torches and hurling the blazing sticks as far as we could out into the sea of ripe, dry grain.

The dry grass went up with a crackle, and then a roar, as the fire took hold. Confused by the heat and smoke of a dozen fires, the grasshoppers flew up like sparks, igniting as their wings caught fire and vanishing into the rising column of smoke and whirling ash.

â€œOf course, it would be just then that Roger chose to arrive with the new tenants,â€ I said, repressing an urge to laugh inappropriately at the memory. â€œPoor things. It was getting dark, and here they all were, standing in the woods with their bundles and children, watching thisâ€”this bally conflagration going on, and all of us dancing round barefoot with our shifts kirtled up, hooting like gibbons and covered with soot.â€

Jamie covered his eyes with one hand, plainly visualizing the scene. His chest shook briefly, and a wide grin spread beneath the hand.

â€œOh, God. They must haâ€™ thought Roger Mac had brought them to hell. Or to a coven meeting, at least.â€

A bubble of guilty laughter was forcing itself up from under my ribs.

â€œThey did. Oh, Jamieâ€”the looks on their faces!â€ I lost my grip and buried my own face in his chest. We shook together for a moment, laughing almost soundlessly.

â€œI did try to make them welcome,â€ I said, snorting a little. â€œWe gave them supper, and found them all places to sleepâ€”as many as we could fit in the house, the rest spread between Briannaâ€™s cabin, the stable, and the barn. I came down quite late at night, thoughâ€”I couldnâ€™t sleep, for all the excitementâ€”and found a dozen of them praying in the kitchen.â€

They had been standing in a circle near the hearth, hands linked and heads bowed reverently. All the heads had snapped up at my appearance, eyes showing white in thin, haggard faces. Theyâ€™d stared at me in total silence, and one of the women had let go the hand of the man beside her to hide her own hand under her apron. In another time and place, I should have thought she was reaching for some weaponâ€”and perhaps she was, at that; I was fairly sure she was making the sign of the horns beneath the shelter of the ragged cloth.

Iâ€™d already discovered that only a few of them spoke English. I asked in my halting Gaelic whether they needed anything? They stared at me as though I had two heads, then after a moment, one of the men, a wizened creature with a thin mouth, had shaken his head the barest inch.

â€œThen they went right back to their praying, leaving me to skulk off back to bed.â€

â€œYe went down in your shift?â€

â€œWell . . . yes. I didnâ€™t expect anyone to be awake at that hour.â€

â€œMmphm.â€ His knuckles grazed my breast, and I could tell exactly what he was thinking. My summer night rail was thin, worn linen, and yes, all right, dammit, I supposed one could see through it a bit in the light, but the kitchen had been lit only by the ruddy glow of a smoored hearth.

â€œI dinna suppose ye went down in a proper nightcap, Sassenach?â€ Jamie asked, running a thoughtful hand through my hair. Iâ€™d loosened it to go to bed with him, and it was writhing off merrily in all directions, Ã  la Medusa.

â€œOf course not. I had it plaited, though,â€ I protested. â€œQuite respectable!â€

â€œOh, quite,â€ he agreed, grinning, and pushing his fingers up into the wild mass of my hair, cradled my head in his hands and kissed me. His lips were chapped from wind and sun, but agreeably soft. He hadnâ€™t shaved since his departure and his beard was short and curly, springy to the touch.

â€œWell, so. Theyâ€™re sorted now, I expect? The tenants?â€ His lips brushed my cheek, and nibbled gently at my ear. I inhaled deeply.

â€œAh. Oh. Yes. Arch Bug took them off in the morning; heâ€™s got them parceled out with families all over the Ridge, and already working on . . .â€ My train of thought temporarily derailed, and I closed my fingers by reflex in the muscle of his chest.

â€œAnd ye told Murdo Iâ€™d make it right with him, of course. About the barley?â€

â€œYes, of course.â€ My drifting attention snagged momentarily and I laughed. â€œHe just stared at me, and then nodded in a dazed sort of way, and said, oh, just as Himself liked, to be sure. I donâ€™t know if he realized even then why Iâ€™d burnt his field; perhaps he just thought Iâ€™d taken a sudden fancy to set fire to his barley.â€

Jamie laughed, tooâ€”a most unsettling sensation, as he had his teeth fixed in my earlobe.

â€œUm,â€ I said faintly, feeling the tickle of red beard on my neck and the very warm, firm flesh beneath my palm. â€œThe Indians. How did you manage with the Cherokee?â€

â€œFine.â€

He moved suddenly, rolling over on top of me. He was very big, and very warm, and he smelled of desire, strong and sharp. The leafy shadows moved across his face and shoulders, dappled the bed and the white skin of my thighs, opened wide.

â€œI like ye fine, Sassenach,â€ he murmured in my ear. â€œI can see ye there, half-naked in your shift and your hair down, curling over your breest. . . . I love you. I worâ€”â€

â€œWhat was that about a rest and supper?â€

His hands were worming themselves under me, cupping my buttocks, squeezing, his breath soft and hot on my neck.

â€œI have to have myâ€”â€

â€œButâ€”â€

â€œNow, Sassenach.â€ He rose up abruptly, kneeling on the bed before me. There was a faint smile on his face, but his eyes were dark blue and intent. He cupped his heavy balls in one hand, the thumb moving up and down his exigent member in a slow and thoughtful manner.

â€œOn your knees, a nighean,â€ he said softly. â€œNow.â€

THE LIMITS OF POWER




From James Fraser, Esq., Fraserâ€™s Ridge

to Lord John Grey of Mount Josiah Plantation

August 14, 1773

My lordâ€”

I write to inform you of my new Office, viz, that of Indian Agent to the Crown, by Appointment to the Southern Department under John Stuart.

I was originally of two Minds regarding Acceptance of this Appointment, but found my Views made more singular by Reason of a Visit by Mr. Richard Brown, a distant Neighbor, and his Brother. I expect that Mr. Higgins will already have given you an Account of their so-called Committee of Safety, and its immediate Object of arresting him.

Have you encountered such ad hoc Bodies in Virginia? I think perhaps your Situation is not so unsettled as is our own, or that in Boston, where Mr. Higgins also reports their Presence. I hope it is not.

I think a Person of Sense must deplore these committees in Principle. Their stated Purpose is to provide Protection from Vagabonds and Banditti, and to arrest Criminals in those Areas where no Sheriff or Constable is available. With no Law to regulate their Behavior save Self-interest, though, plainly there is Nothing to prevent an irregular Militia from becoming more of a Threat to the Citizenry than the Dangers from which it offers to preserve them.

The Appeal is plain, though, particularly in such Case as we find ourselves here, so remotely situated. The nearest Courthouse isâ€”or wasâ€”three daysâ€™ Ride, and in the constant Unrest that has followed the Regulation, Matters have decayed even from this unsatisfactory State. The Governor and his Council are in constant Conflict with the Assembly, the Circuit Court has effectually ceased to exist, Judges are no longer appointed, and there is no Sheriff of Surry County at present, the latest Holder of that Office having resigned under Threat of having his House fired.

The Sheriffs of Orange and Rowan Counties still boast Officeâ€”but their Corruption is so well known that no one may depend upon them, save those whose Interest is invested in them.

We hear frequent reports these Days of House-burnings, Assaults, and similar Alarums in the Wake of the recent War of Regulation. Governor Tryon officially pardoned some of those involved in the Conflict, but did nothing to prevent local Retribution against them; his Successor is still less able to deal with such Eventsâ€”which are in any Case occurring in the Backcountry, far from his Palace in New Bern and thus the more easily ignored. (In all Justice, the Man doubtless has Troubles nearer at Hand to deal with.)

Still, while Settlers here are accustomed to defend themselves from the normal Threats of the Wilderness, the Occurrence of such random Attacks as theseâ€”and the Possibility of Irruption of the Indians, so close to the Treaty Lineâ€”is sufficient to unnerve them, and cause them to greet with Relief the Appearance of any Body willing to undertake the Role of public Protection. Hence the Vigilantes of the Committees are welcomedâ€”at least to begin with.

I give you so much Detail by way of explaining my Thoughts regarding the Appointment. My friend Major MacDonald (late of the 32nd Cavalry) had told me that should I ultimately decline to become an Indian Agent, he would approach Mr. Richard Brown, Brown being in the way of doing substantial Trade with the Cherokee, and thus in a position of Acquaintance and presumed Trust that would predispose his Acceptance by the Indians.

My Acquaintance with Mr. Brown and his Brother inclines me to regard this Prospect with Alarm. With such Rise in Influence as such an Appointment would bring, Brownâ€™s Stature in this unsettled Region might shortly become so great that no man could easily oppose him in any Ventureâ€”and that, I think, is dangerous.

My Son-in-law astutely observes that a Manâ€™s sense of Morality tends to decrease as his Power increases, and I suspect that the Brothers Brown possess relatively little of the Former to begin with. It may be mere Hubris on my part, to assume that I have more. I have seen the corrosive Effects of Power upon a Manâ€™s Soulâ€”and I have felt its Burden, as you will understand, having borne it so often yourself. Still, if it is a choice between myself and Richard Brown, I suppose I must resort to the old Scottish Adage that the Devil you ken is better than the Devil you donâ€™t.

I am likewise made uneasy at the Thought of the long Absences from Home which my new Duties must require. And yet I cannot in Conscience allow the People under my Dominion to be subject to the Vagaries and possible Injuries of Brownâ€™s Committee.

I could of course convene my own such Committeeâ€”I think you would urge such a Courseâ€”but will not. Beyond the Inconvenience and Expense of such a Move, it would be Tantamount to declaring open War with the Browns, and I think that not prudent, not if I must be frequently away from home, leaving my Family unprotected. This new Appointment, though, will extend my own Influence, andâ€”I trustâ€”put some Limit to the Brownsâ€™ Ambitions.

So having reached this Decision, I sent Word at once to accept the Appointment, and essayed my first Visit to the Cherokee in the Office of Indian Agent during the last Month. My initial Reception was most Cordial, and I hope my Relations with the Villages will remain so.

I shall visit the Cherokee again in the Autumn. If you should have any Matters of Business that my new Office might assist, send to me regarding them, and rest assured that I shall make every Effort on your Behalf.

To more domestic Matters. Our small Population has nearly doubled, as the Result of an Influx of Settlers newly arrived from Scotland. While most desirable, this Incursion has caused no little Turmoil, the Newcomers being Fisher-folk from the Coast. To these, the Mountain Wilderness is full of Threat and Mystery, such Threats and Mysteries being personified by Pigs and Plowshares.

(With regard to Pigs, I am not sure but that I share their Views. The white Sow has lately taken up Residence beneath the Foundation of my House and there engages in such debauches that our Dinner is disturbed daily by hellish Noises resembling the Sounds of Souls in Torment. These Souls apparently being torn Limb from Limb and devoured by Demons beneath our Feet.)

Since I speak of Matters hellish, I must observe that our Newcomers are also, alas, stern Sons of the Covenant, to whom a Papist such as myself presents himself as one fully furnished with Horns and Tail. You will recall one Thomas Christie, I think, from Ardsmuir? By comparison of these stiff-necked Gentlemen, Mr. Christie appears the Soul of compassionate Generosity.

I had not thought to thank Providence for the Fact that my Son-in-law is Presbyterian by inclination, but I see now how true it is that the Almighty does indeed have Designs beyond the Ken of us poor mortals. While even Roger MacKenzie is a sadly depraved Libertine by their Lights, the new Tenants are at least able to speak to him without the Necessity of small Gestures and Signs intended to repel Evil, which are the constant Accompaniment to their Conversations with myself.

As for their Behavior with Respect to my Wife, you would think her the Witch of Endor, if not the Great Whore of Babylon. This, because they consider the Furnishments of her Surgery to be â€œEnchantments,â€ and were appalled at witnessing the Entrance therein of a Number of Cherokee, gaily festooned for visiting, who had come to Trade in such Arcana as Snakesâ€™ Fangs and the Gallbladders of Bears.

My wife begs me express her Pleasure at your kind Compliments regarding Mr. Higginsâ€™s improved Healthâ€”and still more, at your Offer to procure medicinal Substances for her from your Friend in Philadelphia. She bids me send you the enclosed List. As I cast an Eye upon this, I suspect that your supplying of her Desires will do nothing to allay the Suspicions of the Fisher-folk, but pray do not desist on that Account, as I think nothing save Time and Custom will decrease their Fears of her.

My Daughter likewise bids me express her Gratitude for your Present of the Phosphorus. I am not certain that I share this Sentiment, given that her Experiments with the Substance prove frighteningly incendiary to date. Fortunately, none of the Newcomers observed these Experiments, or they would be in no Doubt that Satan is indeed a particular Friend to me and mine.

In happier Vein, I congratulate you upon your latest Vintage, which is indeed drinkable. I send in return a Jug of Mrs. Bugâ€™s best Cider, and a Bottle of the barrel-aged Three-year-old, which I flatter myself you will find less corrosive to the Gullet than the last Batch.





Your obâ€™t. servant,





J. Fraser

Postscriptum: I have had Report of a Gentleman who by Description resembles one Stephen Bonnet, this Man appearing briefly in Cross Creek last Month. If it was indeed the Gentleman, his Business is unknown, and he seems to have vanished without Trace; my Uncle-in-law, Duncan Innes, has made Inquiries in the Area, but writes to tell me that these have proved fruitless. Should you hear of anything in this Regard, I pray you will advise me at once.

VROOM!




From the Dreambook

Last night I dreamed of running water. Generally, this means I drank too much before I went to bed, but this was different. The water was coming from the faucet in the sink at home. I was helping Mama do the dishes; she was running hot water from the hose-sprayer over the plates, then handing them to me to dry; I could feel the hot china through the dish towel, and feel the mist of water on my face.

Mamaâ€™s hair was curling up like mad because of the humidity, and the pattern on the plates was the lumpy pink roses of the good wedding china. Mama didnâ€™t let me wash that until I was ten or so, for fear Iâ€™d drop it, and when I got to wash it at last, I was so proud!

I can still see every last thing in the china cabinet in the living room: Mamaâ€™s great-grandfatherâ€™s hand-painted cake stand (he was an artist, she said, and won a competition with that cake stand, a hundred years ago), the dozen crystal goblets that Daddyâ€™s mother left him, along with the cut-glass olive dish and the cup and saucer hand-painted with violets and gilt rims.

I was standing in front of it, putting away the chinaâ€”but we didnâ€™t keep the china in that cabinet; we kept it in the shelf over the ovenâ€”and the water was overflowing from the sink in the kitchen, and running out across the floor, puddling round my feet. Then it started to rise, and I was sloshing back and forth to the kitchen, kicking up the water so it sparkled like the cut-glass olive dish. The water got deeper and deeper, but nobody seemed to be worried; I wasnâ€™t.

The water was warm, hot, in fact, I could see steam rising off it.

Thatâ€™s all there was to the dreamâ€”but when I got up this morning, the water in the basin was so cold I had to warm water in a pan on the fire before I washed Jemmy. All the time I was checking the water on the fire, I kept remembering my dream, and all those gallons and gallons of hot, running water.

What I wonder is, these dreams I have about thenâ€”they seem so vivid and detailed; more than the dreams I have about now. Why do I see things that donâ€™t exist anywhere except inside my brain?

What I wonder about the dreams isâ€”all the new inventions people think upâ€”how many of those things are made by people like meâ€”like us? How many â€œinventionsâ€ are really memories, of the things we once knew? Andâ€”how many of us are there?



â€œIT ISNâ€™T REALLY that hard to have hot, running water. In theory.â€

â€œNo? I suppose not.â€ Roger only half-heard, concentrated as he was on the object taking shape beneath his knife.

â€œI mean, it would be a big, horrible job to do. But itâ€™s simple in concept. Dig ditches or build sluicesâ€”and around here, it would probably be sluices. . . .â€

â€œIt would?â€ Here was the tricky bit. He held his breath, chiseling delicate, tiny slivers of wood away, one shaving at a time.

â€œNo metal,â€ Bree said patiently. â€œIf you had metal, you could make surface pipes. But I bet there isnâ€™t enough metal in the whole colony of North Carolina to make the piping youâ€™d need to bring water from the creek to the Big House. Let alone a boiler! And if there was, it would cost a fortune.â€

â€œMmm.â€ Feeling that this was perhaps not an adequate response, Roger added hastily, â€œBut thereâ€™s some metal available. Jamieâ€™s still, for instance.â€

His wife snorted.

â€œYeah. I asked him where he got itâ€”he said he won it in a high-stakes game of loo against a shipâ€™s captain in Charleston. Think I could travel four hundred miles to bet my silver bracelet against a few hundred feet of rolled copper?â€

One more sliver . . . two . . . the smallest scrape with the tip of the knife . . . ah. The tiny circle came free of the matrix. It turned!

â€œEr . . . sure,â€ he said, belatedly realizing that sheâ€™d asked him a question. â€œWhy not?â€

She burst out laughing.

â€œYou havenâ€™t heard one single word Iâ€™ve said, have you?â€

â€œOh, sure I have,â€ he protested. â€œâ€˜Ditch,â€™ ye said. And â€˜water.â€™ Iâ€™m sure I remember that one.â€

She snorted again, though mildly.

â€œWell, youâ€™d have to do it, anyway.â€

â€œDo what?â€ His thumb sought the little wheel, and set it spinning.

â€œGamble. No oneâ€™s going to let me into a high-stakes card game.â€

â€œThank God,â€ he said, in reflex.

â€œBless your little Presbyterian heart,â€ she said tolerantly, shaking her head. â€œYouâ€™re not any kind of a gambler, Roger, are you?â€

â€œOh, and you are, I suppose.â€ He said it jokingly, wondering even as he did so why he should feel vaguely reproached by her remark.

She merely smiled at that, wide mouth curving in a way that suggested untold volumes of wicked enterprise. He felt a slight sense of unease at that. She was a gambler, though so far . . . He glanced involuntarily at the large, charred spot in the middle of the table.

â€œThat was an accident,â€ she said defensively.

â€œOh, aye. At least your eyebrows have grown back.â€

â€œHmpf. Iâ€™m nearly there. One more batchâ€”â€

â€œThatâ€™s what ye said last time.â€ He was aware that he was treading on dangerous ground, but seemed unable to stop.

She took a slow, deep breath, gazing at him through slightly narrowed eyes, like one taking the range before firing off some major piece of artillery. Then she seemed to think better of whatever she had been going to say; her features relaxed and she stretched out her hand toward the object he was holding.

â€œWhatâ€™s that youâ€™ve been making?â€

â€œJust a wee bawbee for Jem.â€ He let her take it, feeling the warmth of modest pride. â€œThe wheels all turn.â€

â€œMine, Daddy?â€ Jemmy had been wallowing on the floor with Adso the cat, who was tolerant of small children. Hearing his name, though, he abandoned the cat, who promptly escaped through the window, and popped up to see the new toy.

â€œOh, look!â€ Brianna ran the little car over the palm of her hand and lifted it, letting all four tiny wheels spin free. Jem grabbed eagerly for it, pulling at the wheels.

â€œCareful, careful! Youâ€™ll pull them off! Here, let me show you.â€ Crouching, Roger took the car and rolled it along the hearthstones. â€œSee? Vroom. Vroom-vroom!â€

â€œBroom!â€ Jemmy echoed. â€œLemme do it, Daddy, let me!â€

Roger surrendered the toy to Jemmy, smiling.

â€œBroom! Broom-broom!â€ The little boy shoved the car enthusiastically, then, losing his grip on it, watched open-mouthed as it zoomed to the end of the hearthstone by itself, hit the edge, and flipped over. Squealing with delight, he scampered after the new toy.

Still smiling, Roger glanced up, to see Brianna looking after Jem, a rather odd expression on her face. She felt his eyes on her, and looked down at him.

â€œVroom?â€ she said quietly, and he felt a small internal jolt, like a punch in the stomach.

â€œWhatsit, Daddy, whatâ€™s it?â€ Jemmy had recaptured the toy and ran up to him, clutching it to his chest.

â€œItâ€™s a . . . a . . .â€ he began, helpless. It was in fact a crude replica of a Morris Minor, but even the word â€œcar,â€ let alone â€œautomobile,â€ had no meaning here. And the internal combustion engine, with its pleasantly evocative noises, was at least a century away.

â€œI guess itâ€™s a vroom, honey,â€ said Bree, a distinct tone of sympathy in her voice. He felt the gentle weight of her hand, resting on his head.

â€œEr . . . yeah, thatâ€™s right,â€ he said, and cleared a thickening in his throat. â€œItâ€™s a vroom.â€

â€œBroom,â€ said Jemmy happily, and knelt to roll it down the hearth again. â€œBroom-broom!â€



STEAM. It would have to be steam- or wind-powered; a windmill would work, maybe, to pump water into the system, but if I want hot water, there would be steam anywayâ€”why not use it?

Containment is the problem; wood burns and leaks, clay wonâ€™t hold against pressure. I need metal, thatâ€™s all there is to it. What would Mrs. Bug do, I wonder, if I took the laundry cauldron? Well, I know what sheâ€™d do, and a steam explosion is no comparison; besides, we do need to do the laundry. Iâ€™ll have to dream up something else.

MAKING HAY




MAJOR MACDONALD returned on the final day of haymaking. I was just maneuvering my way along the side of the house with an immense basket of bread, when I saw him near the trailhead, tying up his horse to a tree. He lifted his hat to me and bowed, then came across the dooryard, looking curiously round at the preparations taking place.

We had set up trestles under the chestnut trees, with boards laid across them for tables, and a constant stream of women scurried to and fro like ants between the house and yard, fetching food. The sun was setting, and the men would be in soon for a celebratory feast; filthy, exhausted, starvingâ€”and exhilarated by the end of their labors.

I greeted the Major with a nod, and accepted with relief his offer to carry the bread to the tables for me.

â€œHaying, is it?â€ he said, in answer to my explanation. A nostalgic smile spread across his weathered face. â€œI remember the haymaking, from when I was a lad. But that was in Scotland, aye? Weâ€™d seldom such glorious weather as this for it.â€ He looked up into the blazing deep blue bowl of the August sky above. It really was perfect haying weather, hot and dry.

â€œItâ€™s wonderful,â€ I said, sniffing appreciatively. The scent of fresh hay was everywhereâ€”and so was the hay; there were shimmering mounds of it in every shed, everyone carried bits of it on their clothes, and small trails of scattered straw lay everywhere. Now the smell of cut, dry hay was mingled with the delectable scent of the barbecue that had been simmering underground overnight, the fresh bread, and the heady tang of Mrs. Bugâ€™s cider. Marsali and Bree were bringing down jugs of it from the springhouse, where it had been cooling, along with buttermilk and beer.

â€œI see Iâ€™ve chosen my time well,â€ the Major remarked, viewing all this effort with approval.

â€œIf you came to eat, yes,â€ I said, rather amused. â€œIf you came to talk to Jamie, I rather think youâ€™ll have to wait until tomorrow.â€

He looked at me, puzzled, but had no opportunity to inquire further; I had caught another glimpse of movement at the trailhead. The Major turned, seeing the direction of my glance, and frowned slightly.

â€œWhy, itâ€™s that fellow with the brand on his face,â€ he said, wary disapproval in his voice. â€œI saw him down at Coopersville, but he saw me first, and steered well clear. Will ye have me drive him off, mum?â€ He set down the bread and was already settling his sword belt on his hip, when I gripped his forearm.

â€œYouâ€™ll do no such thing, Major,â€ I said sharply. â€œMr. Higgins is a friend.â€

He gave me a flat look, then dropped his arm.

â€œAs ye like, Mrs. Fraser, of course,â€ he said coolly, and picking up the bread again, went off toward the tables.

Rolling my eyes in exasperation, I went to greet the newcomer. Plainly Bobby Higgins could have joined the Major on the path to the Ridge; just as plainly, he had chosen not to. He had become a little more familiar with mules, I saw; he was riding one and leading another, laden with a promising array of panniers and boxes.

â€œHis Lordshipâ€™s compliments, mum,â€ he said, saluting me smartly as he slid off. From the corner of my eye, I saw MacDonald watchingâ€”and his small start of recognition at the military gesture. So, now he knew Bobby for a soldier, and doubtless would ferret out his background in short order. I repressed a sigh; I couldnâ€™t mend matters; theyâ€™d have to settle it between themselvesâ€”if there was anything to settle.

â€œYouâ€™re looking well, Bobby,â€ I said, smiling as I pushed aside my disquiet. â€œNo difficulties with the riding, I hope?â€

â€œOh, no, mum!â€ He beamed. â€œAnd Iâ€™s not fallen out once since I left you last!â€ â€œFallen outâ€ meant â€œfainted,â€ and I congratulated him on the state of his health, looking him over as he unloaded the pack mule with deft efficiency. He did seem much better; pink and fresh-skinned as a child, bar the ugly brand on his cheek.

â€œYonder lobsterback,â€ he said, affecting insouciance as he set down a box. â€œHeâ€™s known to ye, is he, mum?â€

â€œThatâ€™s Major MacDonald,â€ I said, carefully not looking in the Majorâ€™s direction; I could feel his stare boring into my back. â€œYes. He . . . does things for the Governor, I believe. Not regular army, I mean; heâ€™s a half-pay officer.â€

That bit of information seemed to ease Bobbyâ€™s mind a bit. He took a breath, as though to say something, but then thought better of it. Instead, he reached into his shirt and withdrew a sealed letter, which he handed over.

â€œThatâ€™s for you,â€ he explained. â€œFrom his Lordship. Is Miss Lizzie by any chance about?â€ His eyes were already searching the flock of girls and women readying the tables.

â€œYes, she was in the kitchen last I saw,â€ I replied, a small uneasy feeling skittering down my backbone. â€œSheâ€™ll be out in a minute. But . . . you do know sheâ€™s betrothed, donâ€™t you, Bobby? Her fiancÃ© will be coming with the other men for supper.â€

He met my eyes and smiled with singular sweetness.

â€œOh, aye, mum, I know that well enough. Onâ€™y thought as I sâ€™ould thank her for her kindness when I last was here.â€

â€œOh,â€ I said, not trusting that smile in the slightest. Bobby was a very handsome lad, blind eye or notâ€”and he had been a soldier. â€œWell . . . good.â€

Before I could say more, I caught the sound of male voices, coming through the trees. It wasnâ€™t precisely singing; sort of a rhythmic chant. I wasnâ€™t sure what it wasâ€”there was a lot of Gaelic â€œHo-ro!â€ and the likeâ€”but all of them seemed to be bellowing along in a cordial fashion.

Haymaking was a novel concept to the new tenants, who were much more accustomed to rake kelp than scythe grass. Jamie, Arch, and Roger had shepherded them through the process, though, and I had been asked to stitch no more than a handful of minor wounds, so I assumed it had been a successâ€”no hands or feet lopped off, a few shouting matches, but no fistfights, and no more than the usual amount of hay trampled or ruined.

All of them seemed in good spirits as they poured into the dooryard, bedraggled, sweat-soaked, and thirsty as sponges. Jamie was in the thick of them, laughing and staggering as someone pushed him. He caught sight of me, and a huge grin split his sun-browned face. In a stride, he had reached me and swept me into an exuberant embrace, redolent of hay, horses, and sweat.

â€œDone, by God!â€ he said, and kissed me soundly. â€œChrist, I need a drink. And nay, thatâ€™s no blasphemy, wee Roger,â€ he added, with a glance behind him. â€œItâ€™s heartfelt gratitude and desperate need, aye?â€

â€œAye. First things first, though, hm?â€ Roger had appeared behind Jamie, his voice so hoarse that it was barely audible in the general uproar. He swallowed, grimacing.

â€œOh, aye.â€ Jamie shot a quick look at Roger, assessing, then shrugged and strode out into the center of the yard.

â€œEÃ¬sd ris! EÃ¬sd ris!â€ bellowed Kenny Lindsay, seeing him. Evan and Murdo joined him, clapping their hands and shouting â€œHear him!â€ loudly enough that the crowd began to subside and pay attention.

â€œI say the prayer from my mouth,

I say the prayer from my heart,

I say the prayer to Thee Thyself,

O, Healing Hand, O Son of the God of salvation.â€

He didnâ€™t raise his voice much above its normal speaking level, but everyone quieted at once, so the words rang clear.

â€œThou Lord God of the angels,

Spread over me Thy linen robe;

Shield me from every famine,

Free me from every spectral shape.

Strengthen me in every good,

Encompass me in every strait,

Safeguard me in every ill,

And from every enmity restrain me.â€

There was a stirring of faint approval in the crowd; I saw a few of the fisher-folk bow their heads, though their eyes stayed fixed on him.

â€œBe Thou between me and all things grisly,

Be Thou between me and all things mean,

Be Thou between me and all things gruesome

Coming darkly toward me.

â€œO God of the weak,

O God of the lowly,

O God of the righteous,

O shield of homesteads:

â€œThou art calling upon us

In the voice of glory,

With the mouth of mercy

Of Thy beloved Son.â€

I glanced at Roger, who was nodding slightly with approval, as well. Evidently, theyâ€™d agreed on it together. Sensible; it would be a prayer familiar in form to the fisher-folk, and nothing specifically Catholic about it.

Jamie spread his arms, quite unconsciously, and the breeze caught the worn damp linen of his shirt as he tilted back his head and raised his face to the sky, open with joy.

â€œO may I find rest everlasting

In the home of Thy Trinity,

In the Paradise of the godly,

In the Sun-garden of Thy love!â€

â€œAmen!â€ said Roger, as loudly as he could, and there were gratified murmurs of â€œamenâ€ round the yard. Then Major MacDonald raised the tankard of cider he was holding, called â€œSlÃ inte!â€ and drained it.

Festivity became general after that. I found myself sitting on a cask, Jamie on the grass at my feet, with a platter of food and a constantly refilled mug of cider.

â€œBobby Higgins is here,â€ I told him, catching sight of Bobby in the midst of a small group of admiring young ladies. â€œDo you see Lizzie anywhere?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, stifling a yawn. â€œWhy?â€

â€œHe asked for her particularly.â€

â€œThen Iâ€™m sure heâ€™ll find her. Will ye have a bit oâ€™ meat, Sassenach?â€ He held up a large rib bone, brow cocked inquiringly.

â€œIâ€™ve had some,â€ I assured him, and he at once tore into it, addressing himself to the vinegar-spiced barbecue as though he hadnâ€™t eaten for a week.

â€œHas Major MacDonald spoken to you?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, mouth full, and swallowed. â€œHeâ€™ll keep. Thereâ€™s Lizzieâ€”wiâ€™ the McGillivrays.â€

I felt reassured by that. The McGillivraysâ€”particularly Frau Uteâ€”would certainly discourage any inappropriate attentions to their new intended daughter-in-law. Lizzie was chatting and laughing with Robin McGillivray, who was smiling at her in fatherly fashion, while his son Manfred ate and drank with single-minded appetite. Frau Ute, I saw, was keeping a sharp and interested eye on Lizzieâ€™s father, who was sitting on the porch nearby, cozily side by side with a tall, rather plain-faced German lady.

â€œWhoâ€™s that with Joseph Wemyss?â€ I asked, nudging Jamie with my knee to direct his attention.

He narrowed his eyes against the sunâ€™s glare, looking, then shrugged.

â€œI dinna ken. Sheâ€™s German; she must haâ€™ come with Ute McGillivray. Matchmaking, aye?â€ He tilted up his mug and drank, sighing with bliss.

â€œDo you think so?â€ I looked at the strange woman with interest. She certainly seemed to be getting on well with Josephâ€”and he with her. His thin face was alight as he gestured, explaining something to her, and her neatly capped head was bent toward him, a smile on her lips.

I didnâ€™t always approve of Ute McGillivrayâ€™s methods, which tended toward the juggernaut, but I had to admire the painstaking intricacy of her plans. Lizzie and Manfred would marry next spring, and I had wondered how Joseph would fare then; Lizzie was his whole life.

He might, of course, go with her when she married. She and Manfred would simply live in the McGillivraysâ€™ large house, and I imagined that they would find room for Joseph, too. Still, he would be torn, not wanting to leave usâ€”and while any able-bodied man could always be of use on a homestead, he was by no means a natural farmer, let alone a gunsmith, like Manfred and his father. If he himself were to wed, though . . .

I gave Ute McGillivray a glance, and saw her watching Mr. Wemyss and his inamorata with the contented expression of a puppet master whose puppets are dancing precisely to her tune.

Someone had left a pitcher of cider beside us. I refilled Jamieâ€™s mug, then my own. It was wonderful, a dark, cloudy amber, sweet and pungent and with the bite of a particularly subtle serpent to it. I let the cool liquid trickle down my throat and bloom inside my head like a silent flower.

There was much talk and laughter, and I noticed that while the new tenants still kept to their own family groups, there was now a little more blending, as the men who had been working side-by-side for the last two weeks maintained their cordial relations, these social courtesies fueled by cider. The new tenants mostly regarded wine as a mocker, strong drinkâ€”whisky, rum, or brandyâ€”as raging, but everyone drank beer and cider. Cider was wholesome, one of the women had told me, handing a mug to her small son. I gave it half an hour, I thought, sipping slowly, before they started dropping like flies.

Jamie made a small amused sound, and I looked down at him. He nodded at the far side of the dooryard, and I looked to see that Bobby Higgins had disentangled himself from his admirers, and by some alchemical legerdemain had managed to abstract Lizzie from the midst of the McGillivrays. They were standing in the shadow of the chestnut trees, talking.

I looked back at the McGillivrays. Manfred was leaning against the foundation of the house, head nodding over his plate. His father had curled up beside him on the ground and was snoring peacefully. The girls chatted around them, passing food to and fro over the drooping heads of their husbands, all in various stages of impending somnolence. Ute had moved to the porch, and was talking to Joseph and his companion.

I glanced back. Lizzie and Bobby were only talking, and there was a respectful distance between them. But there was something about the way he bent toward her, and the way she half-turned away from him, then back, swinging a fold of her skirt one-handed . . .

â€œOh, dear,â€ I said. I shifted a little, getting my feet under me, but unsure whether I ought really to go and interrupt them. After all, they were in plain sight, andâ€”

â€œThree things astonish me, nay four, sayeth the prophet.â€ Jamieâ€™s hand squeezed my thigh, and I looked down to see that he was also watching the couple under the chestnut trees, his eyes half-closed. â€œThe way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent on the rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the seaâ€”and the way of a man with a maid.â€

â€œOh, so Iâ€™m not imagining it,â€ I said dryly. â€œDo you think Iâ€™d best do something?â€

â€œMmphm.â€ He took a deep breath and straightened up, shaking his head vigorously to wake himself. â€œAh. No, Sassenach. If wee Manfred willna take the trouble to guard his woman, itâ€™s no your place to do it for him.â€

â€œYes, I quite agree. Iâ€™m only thinking, if Ute should see them . . . or Joseph?â€ I wasnâ€™t sure what Mr. Wemyss would do; I thought Ute would probably make a major scene.

â€œOh.â€ He blinked, swaying a little. â€œAye, I suppose yeâ€™re right.â€ He turned his head, searching, then spotting Ian, lifted his chin in summons.

Ian had been sprawled dreamily on the grass a few feet away, next to a pile of greasy rib bones, but now rolled over and crawled obligingly to us.

â€œMm?â€ he said. His thick brown hair had fallen half out of its binding, and several cowlicks were sticking straight up, the rest fallen disreputably over one eye.

Jamie nodded in the direction of the chestnut trees.

â€œGo and ask wee Lizzie to mend your hand, Ian.â€

Ian glanced blearily down at his hand; there was a fresh scratch across the back of it, though it was long since clotted. Then he looked in the direction Jamie indicated.

â€œOh,â€ he said. He remained on hands and knees, eyes narrowed thoughtfully, then slowly rose to his feet, and pulled the binding off his hair. Casually shoving it back with one hand, he strolled in the direction of the chestnut trees.

They were much too far away to hear anything, but we could see. Bobby and Lizzie parted like the waves of the Red Sea as Ianâ€™s tall, gangly form stepped purposefully between them. The three seemed to chat amiably for a moment, then Lizzie and Ian departed for the house, Lizzie giving Bobby a casual wave of the handâ€”and a brief, backward glance. Bobby stood for a moment looking after her, rocking thoughtfully on his heels, then shook his head and made for the cider.

The cider was taking its toll. Iâ€™d expected every man in the place to be laid out cold by nightfall; during haying, men commonly fell asleep in their plates from sheer exhaustion. As it was, there was still plenty of talk and laughter, but the soft twilight glow beginning to suffuse the dooryard showed an increasing number of bodies strewn in the grass.

Rollo was gnawing contentedly on Ianâ€™s discarded bones. Brianna sat a little way away; Roger lay with his head in her lap, sound asleep. The collar of his shirt was open, the ragged rope scar still vivid across his neck. Bree smiled at me, her hand gently stroking his glossy black hair, picking bits of hay out of it. Jemmy was nowhere to be seenâ€”neither was Germain, as I ascertained with a quick look around. Luckily the phosphorus was under lock and key, in the top of my highest cupboard.

Jamie laid his own head against my thigh, warm and heavy, and I put my hand on his hair, smiling back at Bree. I heard him snort faintly, and looked in the direction of his gaze.

â€œFor such a wee small lass, yon Lizzie does cause a good deal of trouble,â€ he said.

Bobby Higgins was standing beside one of the tables, drinking cider, and quite evidently unaware that he was being stalked by the Beardsley twins. The two of them were slinking like foxes through the wood, not quite out of sight, converging on him from opposite directions.

Oneâ€”Jo, probablyâ€”stepped out suddenly beside Bobby, startling him into spilling his drink. He frowned, wiping at the wet splotch on his shirt, while Jo leaned close, obviously muttering menaces and warnings. Looking offended, Bobby turned away from him, only to be confronted by Kezzie on the other side.

â€œIâ€™m not sure itâ€™s Lizzie whoâ€™s causing the trouble,â€ I said defensively. â€œShe only talked to him, after all.â€ Bobbyâ€™s face was growing noticeably flushed. He set down the mug heâ€™d been drinking from and drew himself up a little, one hand folding into a fist.

The Beardsleys crowded closer, with the evident intention of forcing him into the wood. Glancing warily from one twin to the other, he took a step back, putting a solid tree trunk at his back.

I glanced down; Jamie was watching through half-closed lids, with an expression of dreamy detachment. He sighed deeply, his eyes closed altogether, and he went suddenly and completely limp, the weight of him heavy against me.

The reason for this sudden absquatulation loomed up a second later: MacDonald, ruddy with food and cider, his red coat glowing like a cinder in the sunset light. He looked down at Jamie, peacefully slumbering against my leg, and shook his head. He turned slowly round, surveying the scene.

â€œâ€˜Strewth,â€ he said mildly. â€œIâ€™ll tell ye, mum, Iâ€™ve seen battlefields with much less carnage.â€

â€œOh, have you?â€ His appearance had distracted me, but at the mention of â€œcarnage,â€ I glanced back. Bobby and the Beardsley twins had disappeared, vanished like wisps of mist in the gloaming. Well, if they were beating each other to pulp in the wood, I was sure Iâ€™d hear about it before too long.

With a small shrug, MacDonald bent, took Jamie by the shoulders, and eased him off me, laying him down in the grass with surprising gentleness.

â€œMay I?â€ he asked politely, and upon my nod of assent, sat down beside me on the other side, arms companionably hooked round his knees.

He was neatly dressed, as always, wig and all, but the collar of his shirt was grimy and the skirts of his coat frayed at the hem and spattered with mud.

â€œA great deal of travel these days, Major?â€ I asked, making conversation. â€œYou look rather tired, if youâ€™ll pardon my mentioning it.â€

I had surprised him in the middle of a yawn; he swallowed it, blinking, then laughed.

â€œAye, mum. Iâ€™ve been in the saddle for the last month, and seen a bed perhaps one night in three.â€

He did look tired, even in the soft sunset light; the lines of his face were cut deep with fatigue, the flesh beneath his eyes sagging and smudged. He was not a handsome man, but normally had a brash self-assurance that lent him an attractive air. Now he looked what he was: a half-pay soldier pushing fifty, lacking a regiment or regular duty, struggling for any small connections that might hold some hope of advancement.

I wouldnâ€™t normally have spoken to him of his business, but sympathy moved me to ask, â€œAre you working a lot on behalf of Governor Martin these days?â€

He nodded, and took another gulp of cider, breathing deeply after it.

â€œAye, mum. The Governor has been kind enough to charge me with bringing him news of conditions in the backcountryâ€”and has done me the signal favor of accepting my advice, now and then.â€ He glanced at Jamie, who had curled himself up like a hedgehog and commenced to snore, and smiled.

â€œWith regard to my husbandâ€™s appointment as Indian Agent, you mean? We do thank you, Major.â€

He waved a casual hand in dismissal of my thanks.

â€œAh, no, mum; that had nothing to do wiâ€™ the Governor, save indirectly. Such appointments are the province of the Superintendent of the Southern Department. Though it is of course a matter of interest to the Governor,â€ he added, taking another sip, â€œto hear news of the Indians.â€

â€œIâ€™m sure heâ€™ll tell you all about it in the morning,â€ I assured him, with a nod at Jamie.

â€œIndeed, mum.â€ He hesitated for a moment. â€œWould ye ken . . . did Mr. Fraser perhaps mention, in his conversations in the villagesâ€”was there any mention of . . . burnings?â€

I sat up straight, the cider buzz disappearing from my head.

â€œWhatâ€™s happened? Have there been more?â€

He nodded, and rubbed a hand tiredly down his face, scrubbing at the sprout of whiskers.

â€œAye, twoâ€”but the one was a barn-burning, down below Salem. One oâ€™ the Moravian brethrenâ€™s. And from all I can learn of the matter, â€™twas likely some of the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians whoâ€™ve settled in Surry County. Thereâ€™s a wee arsebite of a preacher whoâ€™s got them riled about the Moraviansâ€”Godless heathen that they areâ€”â€ He grinned suddenly at that, but then sobered again.

â€œThereâ€™s been trouble brewing in Surry County for months. To the point that the brethren have been petitioning the Governor to redraw the boundary lines, so as to put them all in Rowan County. The line between Surry and Rowan goes right through their land, ken? And the sheriff in Surry is . . .â€ He twiddled a hand.

â€œPerhaps not so keen in the performance of his duty as he might be?â€ I suggested. â€œAt least where the Moravians are concerned?â€

â€œHeâ€™s the arsebiteâ€™s cousin,â€ MacDonald said, and drained his cup. â€œYeâ€™ve had no trouble wiâ€™ your new tenants, by the way?â€ he added, lowering it. He smiled crookedly, looking round the dooryard at the small groups of women, chattering contentedly as their men slept by their feet. â€œIt would appear yeâ€™ve made them welcome.â€

â€œWell, they are Presbyterians, and fairly vehement about itâ€”but they havenâ€™t tried to burn the house down yet, at least.â€

I took a quick glance at the porch, where Mr. Wemyss and his companion still sat, heads close in conversation. I thought Mr. Wemyss was probably the only man still conscious, bar the Major himself. The lady was plainly a German, but not, I thought, a Moravian; they very seldom married outside their community, nor did the women often travel far.

â€œUnless you think the Presbyterians have formed a gang for the purpose of purging the countryside of Papists and Lutheransâ€”and you donâ€™t think that, do you?â€

He smiled briefly at that, though without much humor.

â€œNo. But then, I was raised Presbyterian myself, mum.â€

â€œOh,â€ I said. â€œEr . . . a drop more cider, Major?â€

He held out his cup without demur.

â€œThe other burningâ€”that seems much like the others,â€ he said, graciously choosing to overlook my remark. â€œAn isolated homestead. A man living alone. But this one was just over the Treaty Line.â€

This last was said with a significant glance, and I looked involuntarily at Jamie. Heâ€™d told me that the Cherokee were upset about settlers intruding into their territory.

â€œI shall ask your husband in the morning, of course, mum,â€ MacDonald said, correctly interpreting my glance. â€œBut perhaps yeâ€™d ken whether heâ€™s heard any references . . . ?â€

â€œVeiled threats from a Snowbird chief,â€ I confessed. â€œHe wrote to John Stuart about them. But nothing specific. When did this latest burning happen?â€

He shrugged.

â€œNo telling. I heard of it three weeks ago, but the man who told me had heard of it a month before thatâ€”and heâ€™d not seen it, only heard from someone else.â€

He scratched thoughtfully at his jaw.

â€œSomeone should go and inspect the place, perhaps.â€

â€œMm,â€ I said, not bothering to hide the skepticism in my voice. â€œAnd you think itâ€™s Jamieâ€™s job, do you?â€

â€œI shouldna be so presumptuous as to instruct Mr. Fraser in his duties, mum,â€ he said, with the hint of a smile. â€œBut I will suggest to him that the situation may be of interest, aye?â€

â€œYes, you do that,â€ I muttered. Jamie had planned another quick trip to the Snowbird villages, squeezed in between harvesting and the onset of the cold weather. The notion of marching into the village and quizzing Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning about a burned homestead seemed more than slightly risky, viewed from my perspective.

A slight chill made me shiver, and I gulped the rest of my own cider, wishing suddenly that it was hot. The sun was fully set now, and the air had grown cool, but that wasnâ€™t what was cooling my blood.

What if MacDonaldâ€™s suspicions were right? If the Cherokee had been burning homesteads? And if Jamie were to show up, asking inconvenient questions . . . .

I looked at the house, standing solid and serene, its windows glowing with candlelight, a pale bulwark against the darkening woods beyond.

It is with grief that the news is received of the deaths by fire of James MacKenzie Fraser and his wife, Claire Fraser, in a conflagration that destroyed their house. . . .

The fireflies were coming out, drifting like cool green sparks in the shadows, and I looked upward involuntarily, to see a spray of red and yellow ones from the chimney. Whenever I thought of that gruesome clippingâ€”and I tried not to, nor to count the days between now and January 21 of 1776â€”I had thought of the fire as occurring by accident. Such accidents were more than common, ranging from hearth fires run amok and candlesticks tipped over, to blazes caused by the summer lightning storms. It hadnâ€™t consciously occurred to me before that it might be a deliberate actâ€”an act of murder.

I moved my foot enough to nudge Jamie. He stirred in his sleep, reached out one hand, and clasped it warmly round my ankle, then subsided with a contented groan.

â€œStand between me and all things grisly,â€ I said, half-under my breath.

â€œSlÃ inte,â€ said the Major, and drained his cup again.

DANGEROUS GIFTS




PROPELLED BY MAJOR MACDONALDâ€™S news, Jamie and Ian departed two days later for a quick visit to Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning, and the Major went off on his further mysterious errands, leaving me with Bobby Higgins for assistance.

I was dying to dig into the crates Bobby had brought, but what with one thing and anotherâ€”the white pigâ€™s demented attempt to eat Adso, a goat with infected teats, a strange green mold that had got into the last batch of cheese, the completion of a much-needed summer kitchen, and a stern conversation with the Beardsleys regarding the treatment of guests, among other thingsâ€”it was more than a week before I found leisure to unpack Lord Johnâ€™s present and read his letter.

September 4, 1773

From Lord John Grey, Mount Josiah Plantation

To Mrs. James Fraser

My dear Madamâ€”

I trust that the Articles you requested will have arrived intact. Mr. Higgins is somewhat nervous of carrying the Oil of Vitriol, as I understand he has had some evil Experience connected with it, but we have packed the Bottle with some Care, leaving it sealed as it came from England.

After examining the exquisite Drawings you sentâ€”do I detect your daughterâ€™s elegant Hand in them?â€”I rode to Williamsburg, in order to consult with a famous Glassmaker who abides there under the nomen (doubtless fabulous) of Blogweather. Mr. Blogweather allowed that the Pelican Retort would be simplicity itself, scarcely a fair Test of his Skill, but was enchanted by the Requirements of the distilling Apparatus, particularly the detachable Coil. He apprehended immediately the Desirability of such a Device in case of Breakage, and has made three of them.

Pray consider these my Giftâ€”a most insignificant Demonstration of my abiding Gratitude for your many Kindnesses, both toward myself and Mr. Higgins.





Your most humble and obedient servant,





John Grey

Postscriptum: I have thus far restrained my sense of vulgar Curiosity, but I do venture to hope that on some future Occasion, you may possibly gratify me by explaining the Purpose to which you intend these Articles be put.



THEY HAD PACKED WITH some care. Pried open, the crates proved to be filled with an immense quantity of straw, the bits of glassware and sealed bottles gleaming within, cradled like rocâ€™s eggs.

â€œYou will be careful with that, wonâ€™t â€™ee, mum?â€ Bobby inquired anxiously, as I lifted out a squat, heavy, brown-glass bottle, the cork heavily sealed with red wax. â€œItâ€™s turrible noxious, that stuff.â€

â€œYes, I know.â€ Standing on tiptoe, I boosted the bottle up onto a high shelf, safe from marauding children or cats. â€œHave you seen it used, then, Bobby?â€

His lips drew in tight, and he shook his head.

â€œNot to say used, mum. But Iâ€™ve seen what it does. Was a . . . a lass, in London, what I come to know a bit, whilst we was a-waitinâ€™ the ship to carry us to America. Half her face pretty and smooth as a buttercup but tâ€™other side was so scarred you could scarce look at it. Like as it was melted in a fire, but she said â€™twas vitriol.â€ He glanced up at the bottle, and swallowed visibly. â€œAnother whoreâ€™d thrown it on her, she said, â€™cause of jealousy.â€

He shook his head again, sighing, and reached for the broom to sweep up the scattered straw.

â€œWell, you neednâ€™t worry,â€ I assured him. â€œI donâ€™t propose to throw it at anyone.â€

â€œOh, no, mum!â€ He was quite shocked. â€œI sâ€™ould never think that!â€

I disregarded this reassurance, involved in delving for more treasure.

â€œOh, look,â€ I said, enchanted. I held in my hands the fruit of Mr. Blogweatherâ€™s artistry: a globe of glass, the size of my head, blown to perfect symmetry and lacking even the hint of a bubble. There was a faint blue tinge to the glass, and I could see my own distorted reflection, wide-nosed and bug-eyed, like a mermaid peering out.

â€œAye, mum,â€ said Bobby, dutifully peering at the retort. â€œItâ€™s, er . . . big, inâ€™t it?â€

â€œItâ€™s perfect. Just perfect!â€ Rather than being cut off cleanly from the blowerâ€™s pipe, the neck of the globe had been drawn out into a thick-walled tube about two inches long and an inch in diameter. The edges and interior surface of this had been . . . sanded? Ground? Iâ€™d no idea what Mr. Blogweather had done, but the result was a silky, opaque surface that would form a lovely seal when a similarly finished piece was inserted into it.

My hands were damp with excitement and nervousness, lest I drop the precious thing. I clutched a fold of my apron round it, and turned to and fro, debating where best to put it. I hadnâ€™t expected one so large; I should need Bree or one of the men to make me a suitable support.

â€œIt has to go over a small fire,â€ I explained, frowning at the little brazier I used for brewing. â€œBut the temperature is important; a charcoal bed may be too hard to keep at a steady heat.â€ I placed the big ball in my cupboard, safely behind a row of bottles. â€œI think it will have to be an alcohol lampâ€”but itâ€™s bigger than I thought, Iâ€™ll have to have a good-size lamp to heat it. . . .â€

I became aware that Bobby was not listening to my babbling, his attention having been distracted by something outside. He was frowning at something, and I came up behind him, peering through the open window to see what it was.

I should have guessed; Lizzie Wemyss was out on the grass, churning butter under the chestnut trees, and Manfred McGillivray was with her.

I glanced at the pair, engaged in cheerful conversation, then at Bobbyâ€™s somber countenance. I cleared my throat.

â€œPerhaps youâ€™d open the other crate for me, Bobby?â€

â€œEh?â€ His attention was still fixed on the pair outside.

â€œCrate,â€ I repeated patiently. â€œThat one.â€ I nudged it with my toe.

â€œCrate . . . oh! Oh, aye, mum, to be sure.â€ Pulling his gaze from the window, he set about the task, looking glum.

I took the rest of the glassware from the open crate, shaking off the straw and putting globes, retorts, flasks, and coils carefully into a high cupboardâ€”but I kept an eye on Bobby as I did so, pondering this newly revealed situation. I hadnâ€™t thought his feelings for Lizzie were more than a passing attraction.

And perhaps it was no more than that, I reminded myself. But if it was . . . Despite myself, I glanced through the window, only to discover that the pair had become a trio.

â€œIan!â€ I exclaimed. Bobby glanced up, startled, but I was already heading for the door, hastily brushing straw from my clothes.

If Ian was back, Jamie wasâ€”

He came through the front door just as I barreled into the hallway, and grabbed me round the waist, kissing me with sun-dusty enthusiasm and sandpaper whiskers.

â€œYouâ€™re back,â€ I said, rather inanely.

â€œI am, and there are Indians just behind me,â€ he said, clutching my bottom with both hands and rasping his whiskers fervently against my cheek. â€œGod, what Iâ€™d give for a quarter of an hour alone wiâ€™ ye, Sassenach! My balls are burstâ€”ah. Mr. Higgins. I, um, didna see ye there.â€

He let go and straightened abruptly, sweeping off his hat and smacking it against his thigh in an exaggerated pantomime of casualness.

â€œNo, zur,â€ Bobby said morosely. â€œMr. Ianâ€™s back, as well, is he?â€ He didnâ€™t sound as though this was particularly good news; if Ianâ€™s arrival had distracted Lizzie from Manfredâ€”and it hadâ€”it did nothing to redirect her attention to Bobby.

Lizzie had abandoned her churn to poor Manfred, who was turning the crank with an air of obvious resentment, as she went laughing off in the direction of the stable with Ian, presumably to show him the new calf that had arrived during his absence.

â€œIndians,â€ I said, belatedly catching what Jamie had said. â€œWhat Indians?â€

â€œA half-dozen of the Cherokee,â€ he replied. â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€ He nodded at the trail of loose straw leading out of my surgery.

â€œOh, that. That,â€ I said happily, â€œis ether. Or going to be. Weâ€™re feeding the Indians, I suppose?â€

â€œAye. Iâ€™ll tell Mrs. Bug. But thereâ€™s a young woman with them that theyâ€™ve fetched along for ye to tend.â€

â€œOh?â€ He was already striding down the hall toward the kitchen, and I hurried to keep up. â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with her?â€

â€œToothache,â€ he said briefly, and pushed open the kitchen door. â€œMrs. Bug! CÃ¡ bhfuil tÃº? Ether, Sassenach? Ye dinna mean phlogiston, do you?â€

â€œI donâ€™t think that I do,â€ I said, trying to recall what on earth phlogiston was. â€œIâ€™ve told you about anesthesia, though, I knowâ€”thatâ€™s what ether is, a sort of anesthetic; puts people to sleep so you can do surgery without hurting them.â€

â€œVerra useful in case of the toothache,â€ Jamie observed. â€œWhereâ€™s the woman gone to? Mrs. Bug!â€

â€œSo it would be, but it will take some time to make. Weâ€™ll have to make do with whisky for the moment. Mrs. Bug is in the summer kitchen, I expect; itâ€™s bread day. And speaking of alcoholâ€”â€ He was already out the back door, and I scampered across the stoop after him. â€œIâ€™ll need quite a bit of high-quality alcohol, for the ether. Can you bring me a barrel of the new stuff tomorrow?â€

â€œA barrel? Christ, Sassenach, what dâ€™ye mean to do, bathe in it?â€

â€œWell, as a matter of fact, yes. Or rather not meâ€”the oil of vitriol. You pour it gently into a bath of hot alcohol, and itâ€”â€

â€œOh, Mr. Fraser! I did think as how I heard someone a-callinâ€™.â€ Mrs. Bug appeared suddenly with a basket of eggs over one arm, beaming. â€œItâ€™s pleased I am to see ye home again safe!â€

â€œAnd glad to be so, Mrs. Bug,â€ he assured her. â€œCan we be feeding a half-dozen guests for supper?â€

Her eyes went wide for a moment, then narrowed in calculation.

â€œSausage,â€ she declared. â€œAnd neeps. Here, wee Bobby, come and make yourself useful.â€ Handing me the eggs, she seized Bobby, who had come out of the house after us, by the sleeve and towed him off toward the turnip patch.

I had the feeling of having been caught in some rapidly revolving apparatus like a merry-go-round, and took hold of Jamieâ€™s arm in order to steady myself.

â€œDid you know that Bobby Higgins is in love with Lizzie?â€ I asked.

â€œNo, but itâ€™ll do him little good if he is,â€ Jamie replied callously. Taking my hand on his arm as invitation, he took the eggs from me and set them on the ground, then pulled me in and kissed me again, more slowly, but no less thoroughly.

He let go with a deep sigh of content, and glanced at the new summer kitchen we had erected in his absence: a small framed structure consisting of coarse-woven canvas walls and a pine-branch roof, erected round a stone hearth and chimneyâ€”but with a large table inside. Enticing scents of rising dough, fresh-baked bread, oatcakes, and cinnamon rolls wafted through the air from it.

â€œNow, about that quarter of an hour, Sassenach . . . I believe I could manage wiâ€™ a bit less, if necessary. . . .â€

â€œWell, I couldnâ€™t,â€ I said firmly, though I did allow my hand to fondle him for a thoughtful instant. My face was burning from contact with his whiskers. â€œAnd when we do have time, you can tell me what on earth youâ€™ve been doing to bring this on.â€

â€œDreaming,â€ he said.

â€œWhat?â€

â€œI kept havinâ€™ terrible lewd dreams about ye, all the night long,â€ he explained, twitching his breeks into better adjustment. â€œEvery time I rolled over, Iâ€™d lie on my cock and wake up. It was awful.â€

I burst out laughing, and he affected to look injured, though I could see reluctant amusement behind it.

â€œWell, you can laugh, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œYe havena got one to trouble ye.â€

â€œYes, and a great relief it is, too,â€ I assured him. â€œEr . . . what sort of lewd dreams?â€

I could see a deep blue gleam of speculation at the back of his eyes as he looked at me. He extended one finger, and very delicately ran it down the side of my neck, the slope of my breast where it disappeared into my bodice, and over the thin cloth covering my nippleâ€”which promptly popped up like a puffball mushroom in response to this attention.

â€œThe sort that make me want to take ye straight into the forest, far enough that no one will hear when I lay ye on the ground, lift your skirts, and split ye like a ripe peach,â€ he said softly. â€œAye?â€

I swallowed, audibly.

At this delicate moment, whoops of greeting came from the trailhead on the other side of the house.

â€œDuty calls,â€ I said, a trifle breathless.

Jamie drew a deep breath of his own, squared his shoulders, and nodded.

â€œWell, I havena died of unrequited lust yet; I suppose I shallna do it now.â€

â€œDonâ€™t suppose you will,â€ I said. â€œBesides, didnâ€™t you tell me once that abstinence makes . . . er . . . things . . . grow firmer?â€

He gave me a bleak look.

â€œIf it gets any firmer, Iâ€™ll faint from a lack of blood to the heid. Dinna forget the eggs, Sassenach.â€



It was late afternoon, but plenty of light left for the job, thank goodness. My surgery was positioned to take advantage of morning light for operations, though, and was dim in the afternoons, so I set up an impromptu theater of operation in the dooryard.

This was an advantage, insofar as everyone wished to watch; Indians always regarded medical treatmentâ€”and almost anything elseâ€”as a community affair. They were particularly enthusiastic about operations, as these held a high degree of entertainment value. Everyone crowded eagerly around, commenting on my preparations, arguing with each other and talking to the patient, whom I had the greatest difficulty in discouraging from talking back.

Her name was Mouse, and I could only assume that she had been given it for some metaphysical reason, as it certainly wasnâ€™t suited either to appearance or personality. She was round-faced, unusually snub-nosed for a Cherokee, and if she wasnâ€™t precisely pretty, she had a force of character that is often more attractive than simple beauty.

It was certainly working on the males present; she was the only woman in the Indian party, the others consisting of her brother, Red Clay Wilson, and four friends who had come along, either to keep the Wilsons company, offer protection on the journeyâ€”or to vie for Miss Mousieâ€™s attention, which seemed to me the most likely explanation of their presence.

Despite the Wilsonsâ€™ Scottish name, none of the Cherokee spoke any English beyond a few basic wordsâ€”these including â€œno,â€ â€œyes,â€ â€œgood,â€ â€œbad,â€ and â€œwhisky!â€ Since the Cherokee equivalent of these terms was the extent of my own vocabulary, I was taking little part in the conversation.

We were at the moment waiting for whisky, in fact, as well as translators. A settler named Wolverhampton, from some nameless hollow to the east, had inadvertently amputated one and a half toes a week before, while splitting logs. Finding this state of things inconvenient, he had proceeded to try to remove the remaining half-digit himself with a froe.

Say what you will regarding general utility; a froe is not a precision instrument. It is, however, sharp.

Mr. Wolverhampton, a burly sort with an irascible temper, lived on his own, some seven miles from his nearest neighbor. By the time he had reached this neighborâ€”on foot, or what remained of itâ€”and the neighbor had bundled him onto a mule for transport to Fraserâ€™s Ridge, nearly twenty-four hours had passed, and the partial foot had assumed the dimensions and appearance of a mangled raccoon.

The requirements of the cleanup surgery, the multiple subsequent debridements to control the infection, and the fact that Mr. Wolverhampton refused to surrender the bottle, had quite exhausted my usual surgical supply. As I needed a keg of the raw spirit for my ether-making in any case, Jamie and Ian had gone to fetch more from the whisky spring, which was a good mile from the house. I hoped they would return while there was still enough light to see what I was doing.

I interrupted Miss Mousieâ€™s loud remonstrance with one of the gentlemen, who was evidently teasing her, and indicated by means of sign language that she should open her mouth for me. She did, but went on expostulating by means of rather explicit hand signals, which seemed to be indicating various acts she expected the gentleman in question to perform upon himself, judging from his flushed countenance, and the way his companions were falling about with hilarity.

The side of her face was puffed and obviously tender. She didnâ€™t wince or shy away, though, even when I turned her face farther toward the light for a better view.

â€œToothache, forsooth!â€ I said, involuntarily.

â€œOoth?â€ Miss Mouse said, cocking an eyebrow at me.

â€œBad,â€ I explained, pointing at her cheek. â€œUyoi.â€

â€œBad,â€ she agreed. There followed a voluble expositionâ€”interrupted only by my inserting my fingers into her mouth periodicallyâ€”which I took to be an explanation of what had happened to her.

Blunt trauma, by the look of it. One tooth, a lower canine, had been knocked completely out, and the neighboring bicuspid was so badly broken I would have to extract it. The next to that could be saved, I thought. The inside of her mouth was badly lacerated by the sharp edges, but the gum was not infected. That was heartening.

Bobby Higgins came down from the stable, drawn by the chatter, and was promptly sent back to bring me a file. Miss Mousie grinned lopsidedly at him when he brought it, and he bowed extravagantly to her, making all of them laugh.

â€œThese folk are Cherokee, are they, mum?â€ He smiled at Red Clay, and made a hand sign, which seemed to amuse the Indians, though they returned it. â€œIâ€™ve not met any Cherokee before. Itâ€™s mostly other tribes near his Lordshipâ€™s place in Virginia.â€

I was pleased to see that he was familiar with Indians, and easy in his manner toward them. Hiram Crombie, who appeared at this point, was not.

He stopped dead at the edge of the clearing, seeing the assemblage. I waved cheerily at him, andâ€”with evident reluctanceâ€”he advanced.

Roger had told me Duncanâ€™s description of Hiram as â€œthat wee sour-drap.â€ It was apt. He was small and stringy, with thin grizzled hair that he wore strained back in a plait so tight that I thought he must find it difficult to blink. His face deeply lined by the rigors of a fishermanâ€™s life, he looked about sixty, but was likely much youngerâ€”and his mouth was habitually downturned, in the expression of one who has sucked not merely a lemon, but a rotten lemon.

â€œI was looking for Mr. Fraser,â€ he said, with a wary eye on the Indians. â€œI had heard he was back.â€ He had a hatchet in his belt, and kept a tight grip on it with one hand.

â€œHeâ€™ll be back directly. Youâ€™ve met Mr. Higgins, havenâ€™t you?â€ Evidently he had, and had been unfavorably impressed by the experience. His eyes fixed on Bobbyâ€™s brand, he made the smallest possible nod of acknowledgment. Nothing daunted, I waved a hand round at the Indians, who were all examining Hiram with much more interest than he showed in them. â€œMay I introduce Miss Wilson, her brother Mr. Wilson, and . . . er . . . their friends?â€

Hiram stiffened further, if such a thing was possible.

â€œWilson?â€ he said, in an unfriendly voice.

â€œWilson,â€ agreed Miss Mouse cheerily.

â€œThat is my wifeâ€™s family name,â€ he said, in a tone that made it clear he considered the use of it by Indians to be grossly outrageous.

â€œOh,â€ I said. â€œHow nice. Do you think they might be your wifeâ€™s relatives, perhaps?â€

His eyes bulged slightly at that, and I heard a strangled gurgle from Bobby.

â€œWell, they plainly got the name from a Scottish father or grandfather,â€ I pointed out. â€œPerhaps . . .â€

Hiramâ€™s face was working like a nutcracker, emotions from fury to dismay passing in swift succession over it. His right hand curled up, forefinger and little finger protruding in the horns, the sign against evil.

â€œGreat-Uncle Ephraim,â€ he whispered. â€œJesus save us.â€ And without further word, he turned on his heel and tottered off.

â€œGoodbye!â€ called Miss Mousie in English, waving. He cast a single, haunted glance over his shoulder at her, then fled as though pursued by demons.



THE WHISKY FINALLY arrived, and, a fair amount of it passed out to patient and spectators alike, the operation at last commenced.

The file was normally used on horsesâ€™ teeth, and thus a little larger than I would have liked, but worked reasonably well. Miss Mouse was inclined to be loud about the discomfort involved, but her complaints grew less with her increasing intake of whisky. By the time I had to draw her broken tooth, I thought, she wouldnâ€™t feel a thing.

Bobby, meanwhile, was entertaining Jamie and Ian with imitations of Hiram Crombieâ€™s response to the discovery that he might possibly share some family connection with the Wilsons. Ian, between bursts of laughter, translated the matter for the Indians, who all rolled on the grass in paroxysms of mirth.

â€œDo they have an Ephraim Wilson in their family tree?â€ I asked, taking a firm grip of Miss Mousieâ€™s chin.

â€œWell, theyâ€™re not sure of the â€˜Ephraim,â€™ but aye, they do.â€ Jamie grinned broadly. â€œTheir grandsire was a Scottish wanderer. Stayed long enough to get their grandmother wiâ€™ child, then fell off a cliff and was buried by a rockslide. She marrit again, of course, but liked the name.â€

â€œI wonder what it was made Great-Uncle Ephraim leave Scotland?â€ Ian sat up, wiping tears of laughter from his eyes.

â€œThe proximity of people like Hiram, I expect,â€ I said, squinting to see what I was doing. â€œDo you thinkâ€”â€ I realized suddenly that everyone had quit talking and laughing, their attention focused on something across the clearing.

This something was the arrival of another Indian, carrying something in a bundle over his shoulder.



THE INDIAN WAS A gentleman named Sequoyah, somewhat older than the young Wilsons and their friends. He nodded soberly to Jamie, and swinging the bundle off his shoulder, laid it on the ground at Jamieâ€™s feet, saying something in Cherokee.

Jamieâ€™s face changed, the lingering traces of amusement vanishing, replaced by interestâ€”and wariness. He knelt, and carefully turning back the ragged canvas, revealed a jumble of weathered bones, a hollow-eyed skull staring up from the midst of them.

â€œWho in bloody hell is that?â€ I had stopped work, and with everyone else, including Miss Mouse, stood staring down at this latest arrival.

â€œHe says itâ€™s the auld man who owned the homestead MacDonald told ofâ€”the one that burned inside the Treaty Line.â€ Jamie reached down and picked up the skull, turning it gently in his hands.

He heard my small intake of breath, for he glanced at me, then turned the skull over, holding it for me to see. Most of the teeth were missing, and had been missing long enough that the jawbone had closed over the empty sockets. But the two molars remaining showed nothing but cracks and stainsâ€”no gleam of silver filling, no empty space where such fillings might have been.

I let my breath out slowly, not sure whether to be relieved or disappointed.

â€œWhat happened to him? And why is he here?â€

Jamie knelt and laid the skull gently back in the canvas, then turned some of the bones over, examining them. He looked up, and with a small motion of the head, invited me to join him.

The bones showed no sign of having been burned, but several of them did show signs of having been gnawed by animals. One or two of the long bones had been cracked and split, no doubt to get at the marrow, and many of the smaller bones of hands and feet were missing. All of them had the gray, fragile look of bones that had lain outside for some time.

Ian had relayed my question to Sequoyah, who squatted down next to Jamie, explaining as he jabbed a finger here and there amongst the bones.

â€œHe says,â€ Ian translated, frowning, â€œthat he knew the man a long time. They werena friends, exactly, but now and again, when he was near the manâ€™s cabin, he would stop, and the man would share his food. So he would bring things, too, when he cameâ€”a hare for the pot, a bit oâ€™ salt.â€

One day, a few months back, he had found the old manâ€™s body in the wood, lying under a tree, some distance from his house.

â€œNo one kilt him, he says,â€ Ian said, frowning in concentration at the rapid stream of words. â€œHe just . . . died. He thinks the man was huntingâ€”he had a knife on him, and his gun beside himâ€”when the spirit left him, and he just fell down.â€ He echoed Sequoyahâ€™s shrug.

Seeing no reason to do anything with the body, Sequoyah had left it there, and left the knife with it, in case the spirit should require it, wherever it had gone; he did not know where the spirits of white men went, or whether they hunted there. He pointedâ€”there was an old knife, the blade almost rusted away, under the bones.

He had taken the gun, which seemed too good to leave, and as it was on his way, had stopped at the cabin. The old man had owned very little, and what he had was mostly worthless. Sequoyah had taken an iron pot, a kettle, and a jar of cornmeal, which he had carried back to his village.

â€œHeâ€™s no from Anidonau Nuya, is he?â€ Jamie asked, then repeated the question in Cherokee. Sequoyah shook his head, the small ornaments braided into his hair making a tiny chiming sound.

He was from a village some miles west of Anidonau Nuyaâ€”Standing Stone. Bird-who-sings had sent word to the nearby towns, in the wake of Jamieâ€™s visit, asking if there was anyone who knew of the old man and his fate. Hearing Sequoyahâ€™s account, Bird had sent him to collect what was left of the old man, and to bring the remains to Jamie, in proof that no one had killed him.

Ian asked a question, in which I caught the Cherokee word for â€œfire.â€ Sequoyah shook his head again, and replied with a stream of words.

He had not burned the cabinâ€”why should he do such a thing? He thought no one had done so. After collecting the old manâ€™s bonesâ€”his face showed his distaste for the procedureâ€”he had gone to look at the cabin again. True, it was burnedâ€”but it was clear to him that a tree nearby had been struck by lightning, and had set fire to a good bit of the forest near it. The cabin was only half-burned.

He rose to his feet with an air of finality.

â€œWill he stay for supper?â€ I asked, seeing that he seemed about to depart.

Jamie conveyed the invitation, but Sequoyah shook his head. He had done what was required of him; now he had other business. He nodded to the other Indians, then turned to go.

Something struck him, though, and he stopped, turning back.

â€œTsisqua says,â€ he said, in the careful way of one who has memorized a speech in an unfamiliar tongue, â€œyou re-mem-ber de guns.â€ He nodded then decisively, and went.



THE GRAVE WAS MARKED with a small cairn of stones and a small wooden cross made of pine twigs. Sequoyah hadnâ€™t known his acquaintanceâ€™s name, and we had no idea of his age, nor yet the dates of birth and death. We hadnâ€™t known if he was Christian, either, but the cross seemed a good idea.

It was a very small burial service, consisting of myself, Jamie, Ian, Bree and Roger, Lizzie and her father, the Bugs, and Bobby Higginsâ€”who I was fairly sure was in attendance only because Lizzie was. Her father seemed to think so, too, judging from the occasional suspicious glances he cast at Bobby.

Roger read a brief psalm over the grave, then paused. He cleared his throat and said simply, â€œLord, we commend to Thy care the soul of this our brother . . .â€

â€œEphraim,â€ murmured Brianna, eyes cast modestly down.

A subterranean sense of laughter moved through the crowd, though no one actually laughed. Roger gave Bree a dirty look, but I saw the corner of his mouth twitching, as well.

â€œ. . . of our brother, whose name Thou knowest,â€ Roger concluded with dignity, and closed the Book of Psalms he had borrowed from Hiram Crombieâ€”who had declined an invitation to attend the funeral.

The light had gone by the time Sequoyah had finished his revelations the night before, and I was obliged to put off Miss Mouseâ€™s dental work to the morning. Stewed to the gills, she made no objection, and was helpfully supported off to a bed on the kitchen floor by Bobby Higginsâ€”who might or might not be in love with Lizzie, but who seemed nonetheless most appreciative of Miss Mouseâ€™s charms.

Once finished with the tooth-drawing, I had suggested that she and her friends stay for a bit, but they, like Sequoyah, had business elsewhere, and with many thanks and small gifts, had departed by mid-afternoon, smelling strongly of whisky, and leaving us to dispose of the mortal remains of the late Ephraim.

Everyone went back down the hill after the service, but Jamie and I loitered behind, seeking an opportunity to be alone for a few minutes. The house had been full of Indians the night before, with much talk and storytelling by the fire, and by the time we had finally gone to bed, we had simply curled up in each otherâ€™s arms and fallen asleep, barely exchanging the brief civility of a â€œgood night.â€

The graveyard was sited on a small rise, some distance from the house, and was a pretty, peaceful place. Surrounded by pines whose golden needles blanketed the earth, and whose murmuring branches provided a constant soft susurrus, it seemed a comforting spot.

â€œPoor old creature,â€ I said, putting a final pebble on Ephraimâ€™s cairn. â€œHow do you suppose he ended up in such a place?â€

â€œGod knows.â€ Jamie shook his head. â€œThere are always hermits, men who mislike the society of their fellows. Perhaps he was one oâ€™ those. Or perhaps some misfortune drove him into the wilderness, and he . . . stayed.â€ He shrugged a little, and gave me a half-smile.

â€œI sometimes wonder how any of us came to be where we are, Sassenach. Donâ€™t you?â€

â€œI used to,â€ I said. â€œBut after a time, there didnâ€™t seem to be any possibility of an answer, so I stopped.â€

He looked down at me, diverted.

â€œHave ye, then?â€ He put out a hand and tucked back a lock of windblown hair. â€œPerhaps I shouldna ask it, then, but I will. Do ye mind, Sassenach? That ye are here, I mean. Do ye ever wish ye wereâ€”back?â€

I shook my head.

â€œNo, not ever.â€

And that was true. But I woke sometimes in the dead of night, thinking, Is now the dream? Would I wake again to the thick warm smell of central heating and Frankâ€™s Old Spice? And when I fell asleep again to the scent of woodsmoke and the musk of Jamieâ€™s skin, would feel a faint, surprised regret.

If he saw the thought on my face, he gave no sign of it, but bent and kissed me gently on the forehead. He took my arm, and we walked a little way into the wood, away from the house and its clearing below.

â€œSometimes I smell the pines,â€ he said, taking a deep, slow breath of the pungent air. â€œAnd I think for an instant I am in Scotland. But then I come to myself and see; there is no kindly bracken here, nor great barren mountainsâ€”not the wildness that I kent, but only wilderness that I do not.â€

I thought I heard nostalgia in his voice, but not sorrow. Heâ€™d asked, though; so would I.

â€œAnd do you ever wish to be . . . back?â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said, surprising meâ€”and then laughed at the look on my face. â€œBut not enough not to wish more to be here, Sassenach.â€

He glanced over his shoulder at the tiny graveyard, with its small collection of cairns and crosses, with here and there a larger boulder marking a particular grave.

â€œDid ye ken, Sassenach, that some folk believe the last person to lie in a graveyard becomes its guardian? He must stand on guard until the next person dies and comes to take his placeâ€”only then can he rest.â€

â€œI suppose our mysterious Ephraim might be rather surprised to find himself in such a position, when here heâ€™d lain down under a tree all alone,â€ I said, smiling a little. â€œBut I do wonder: what is the guardian of a graveyard guardingâ€”and from whom?â€

He laughed at that.

â€œOh . . . vandals, maybe; desecraters. Or charmers.â€

â€œCharmers?â€ I was surprised at that; Iâ€™d thought the word â€œcharmerâ€ synonymous with â€œhealer.â€

â€œThere are charms that call for bones, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œOr the ashes of a burnt body. Or soil from a grave.â€ He spoke lightly enough, but with no sense of jesting. â€œAye, even the dead may need defending.â€

â€œAnd who better to do it than a resident ghost?â€ I said. â€œQuite.â€

We climbed up through a stand of quivering aspen, whose light dappled us with green and silver, and I paused to scrape a blob of the crimson sap from a paper-white trunk. How odd, I thought, wondering why the sight of it gave me pauseâ€”and then remembered, and turned sharply to look again at the graveyard.

Not a memory, but a dreamâ€”or a vision. A man, battered and broken, rising to his feet amid a stand of aspen, rising for what he knew was the last time, his last fight, baring shattered teeth stained with blood that was the color of the aspensâ€™ sap. His face was painted black for deathâ€”and I knew that there were silver fillings in his teeth.

But the granite boulder stood silent and peaceful, drifted all about with yellow pine needles, marking the rest of the man who had once called himself Otter-Tooth.

The moment passed, and vanished. We walked out of the aspens, and into another clearing, this one higher than the rise the graveyard stood on.

I was surprised to see that someone had been cutting timber here, and clearing the ground. A sizable stack of felled logs lay to one side, and nearby lay a tangle of uprooted stumps, though several more, still rooted in the ground, poked through the heavy growth of wood sorrel and bluet.

â€œLook, Sassenach.â€ Jamie turned me with a hand on my elbow.

â€œOh. Oh, my.â€

The ground rose high enough here that we could look out over a stunning vista. The trees fell away below us, and we could see beyond our mountain, and beyond the next, and the next, into a blue distance, hazed with the breath of the mountains, clouds rising from their hollows.

â€œDâ€™ye like it?â€ The note of proprietorial pride in his voice was palpable.

â€œOf course I like it. Whatâ€”?â€ I turned, gesturing at the logs, the stumps.

â€œThe next house will stand here, Sassenach,â€ he said simply.

â€œThe next house? What, are we building another?â€

â€œWell, I dinna ken will it be us, or maybe our childrenâ€”or grandchildren,â€ he added, mouth curling a little. â€œBut I thought, should anything happenâ€”and I dinna think anything will, mind, but if it shouldâ€”well, I should be happier to have made a start. Just in case.â€

I stared at him for a moment, trying to make sense of this. â€œShould anything happen,â€ I said slowly, and turned to look to the east, where the shape of our house was just visible among the trees, its chimney smoke a white plume among the soft green of the chestnuts and firs. â€œShould it really . . . burn down, you mean.â€ Just putting the idea into words made my stomach curl up into a ball.

Then I looked at him again, and saw that the notion scared him, too. But Jamie-like, he had simply set about to take what action he could, against the day of disaster.

â€œDâ€™ye like it?â€ he repeated, blue eyes intent. â€œThe site, I mean. If not, I can choose another.â€

â€œItâ€™s beautiful,â€ I said, feeling tears prickle at the backs of my eyes. â€œJust beautiful, Jamie.â€



HOT AFTER THE CLIMB, we sat down in the shade of a giant hemlock, to admire our future view. And, with the silence broken concerning the dire possibility of the future, found we could discuss it.

â€œItâ€™s not so much the idea of us dying,â€ I said. â€œOr not entirely. Itâ€™s that â€˜no surviving childrenâ€™ that gives me the whim-whams.â€

â€œWell, I take your point, Sassenach. Though Iâ€™m no in favor of us dying, either, and I mean to see we donâ€™t,â€ he assured me. â€œThink, though. It might not mean theyâ€™re dead. They might only . . . go.â€

I took a deep breath, trying to accept that supposition without panic.

â€œGo. Go back, you mean. Roger and Breeâ€”and Jemmy, I suppose. Weâ€™re assuming he canâ€”can travel through the stones.â€

He nodded soberly, arms clasped about his knees.

â€œAfter what he did to that opal? Aye, I think we must assume he can.â€ I nodded, recalling what heâ€™d done to the opal: held it, complaining of it growing hot in his handâ€”until it exploded, shattering into hundreds of needle-sharp fragments. Yes, I thought we must assume he could time-travel, too. But what if Brianna had another child? It was plain to me that she and Roger wanted anotherâ€”or at least that Roger did, and she was willing.

The thought of losing them was acutely painful, but I supposed the possibility had to be faced.

â€œWhich leaves a choice, I suppose,â€ I said, trying to be brave and objective. â€œIf weâ€™re dead, theyâ€™d go, because without us, theyâ€™ve no real reason to be here. But if weâ€™re not deadâ€”will they go anyway? Will we send them away, I mean? Because of the war. It wonâ€™t be safe.â€

â€œNo,â€ he said softly. His head was bent, stray auburn hairs lifting from his crown, from the cowlicks he had bequeathed both to Bree and to Jemmy.

â€œI dinna ken,â€ he said at last, and lifted his head, looking out into the distance of land and sky. â€œNo one does, Sassenach. We must just meet what comes as we can.â€

He turned and laid his hand over mine, with a smile that had as much of pain in it as joy.

â€œWeâ€™ve ghosts enough between us, Sassenach. If the evils of the past canna hinder usâ€”neither then shall any fears of the future. We must just put things behind us and get on. Aye?â€

I laid a light hand on his chest, not in invitation, but only because I wanted the feel of him. His skin was cool from sweating, but he had helped dig the grave; the heat of his labor glowed in the muscle beneath.

â€œYou were one of my ghosts,â€ I said. â€œFor a long time. And for a long time, I tried to put you behind me.â€

â€œDid ye, then?â€ His own hand came to rest lightly on my back, moving unconsciously. I knew that touchâ€”the need of touching only to reassure oneself that the other was actually there, present in flesh.

â€œI thought I couldnâ€™t live, looking backâ€”couldnâ€™t bear it.â€ My throat was thick with the memory of it.

â€œI know,â€ he said softly, his hand rising to touch my hair. â€œBut ye had the bairnâ€”ye had a husband. It wasna right to turn your back on them.â€

â€œIt wasnâ€™t right to turn my back on you.â€ I blinked, but tears were leaking from the corners of my eyes. He drew my head close, put out his tongue, and delicately licked my face, which surprised me so much that I laughed in the midst of a sob, and nearly choked.

â€œI do love thee, as meat loves salt,â€ he quoted, and laughed, too, very softly. â€œDinna weep, Sassenach. Yeâ€™re here; so am I. Thereâ€™s naught that matters, aside from that.â€

I leaned my forehead against his cheek, and put my arms around him. My hands rested flat on the planes of his back, and I stroked him from the blade of his shoulder to the tapering small of his back, lightly, always lightly, tracing the whole of him, the shape of him, and not the scars that reamed his skin.

He held me close, and sighed deeply.

â€œDâ€™ye ken weâ€™ve been wed this time nearly twice as long as the last?â€

I drew back and frowned dubiously at him, accepting the distraction.

â€œWere we not married in between?â€

That took him by surprise; he frowned, too, and ran a finger slowly down the sunburnt bridge of his nose in thought.

â€œWell, thereâ€™s a question for a priest, to be sure,â€ he said. â€œI should think we wereâ€”but if so, are we not both bigamists?â€

â€œWere, not are,â€ I corrected, feeling slightly uneasy. â€œBut we werenâ€™t, really. Father Anselme said so.â€

â€œAnselme?â€

â€œFather Anselmeâ€”a Franciscan priest at the Abbey of St. Anne. But perhaps you wouldnâ€™t recall him; you were very ill at the time.â€

â€œOh, I recall him,â€ he said. â€œHe would come and sit wiâ€™ me at night, when I couldna sleep.â€ He smiled, a little lopsided; that time wasnâ€™t something he wished to remember. â€œHe liked ye a great deal, Sassenach.â€

â€œOh? And what about you?â€ I asked, wanting to distract him from the memory of St. Anne. â€œDidnâ€™t you like me?â€

â€œOh, I liked ye fine then,â€ he assured me. â€œI maybe like ye even more now, though.â€

â€œOh, do you, indeed.â€ I sat up a little straighter, preening. â€œWhatâ€™s different?â€

He tilted his head to one side, eyes narrowing a bit in appraisal.

â€œWell, ye fart less in your sleep,â€ he began judiciously, then ducked, laughing, as a pinecone whizzed past his left ear. I seized a chunk of wood, but before I could bat him over the head with it, he lunged and caught me by the arms. He shoved me flat in the grass and collapsed on top of me, pinning me effortlessly.

â€œGet off, you oaf! I do not fart in my sleep!â€

â€œNow, how would ye ken that, Sassenach? Ye sleep so sound, ye wouldna wake, even to the sound of your own snoring.â€

â€œOh, you want to talk about snoring, do you? Youâ€”â€

â€œYeâ€™re proud as Lucifer,â€ he said, interrupting. He was still smiling, but the words were more serious. â€œAnd yeâ€™re brave. Ye were always bolder than was safe; now yeâ€™re fierce as a wee badger.â€

â€œSo Iâ€™m arrogant and ferocious. This does not sound like much of a catalog of womanly virtues,â€ I said, puffing a bit as I strained to wriggle out from under him.

â€œWell, yeâ€™re kind, too,â€ he said, considering. â€œVerra kind. Though ye are inclined to do it on your own terms. Not that thatâ€™s bad, mind,â€ he added, neatly recapturing the arm I had extricated. He pinned my wrist over my head.

â€œWomanly,â€ he murmured, brows knotted in concentration. â€œWomanly virtues . . .â€ His free hand crept between us and fastened on my breast.

â€œBesides that!â€

â€œYouâ€™re verra clean,â€ he said approvingly. He let go my wrist and ruffled a hand through my hairâ€”which was indeed clean, smelling of sunflower and marigolds.

â€œIâ€™ve never seen any woman wash herself sae much as you doâ€”save Brianna, perhaps.

â€œYeâ€™re no much of a cook,â€ he went on, squinting thoughtfully. â€œThough yeâ€™ve never poisoned anyone, save on purpose. And I will say ye sew a neat seamâ€”though ye like it much better if itâ€™s through someoneâ€™s flesh.â€

â€œThanks so much!â€

â€œTell me some more virtues,â€ he suggested. â€œPerhaps Iâ€™ve missed one.â€

â€œHmph! Gentleness, patience . . .â€ I floundered.

â€œGentle? Christ.â€ He shook his head. â€œYeâ€™re the most ruthless, bloodthirstyâ€”â€

I darted my head upward, and nearly succeeded in biting him in the throat. He jerked back, laughing.

â€œNo, yeâ€™re no verra patient, either.â€

I gave up struggling for the moment and collapsed flat on my back, tousled hair spread out on the grass.

â€œSo what is my most endearing trait?â€ I demanded.

â€œYe think Iâ€™m funny,â€ he said, grinning.

â€œI . . . do . . . not . . .â€ I grunted, struggling madly. He merely lay on top of me, tranquilly oblivious to my pokings and thumpings, until I exhausted myself and lay gasping underneath him.

â€œAnd,â€ he said thoughtfully, â€œye like it verra much when I take ye to bed. No?â€

â€œEr . . .â€ I wanted to contradict him, but honesty forbade. Besides, he bloody well knew I did.

â€œYou are squashing me,â€ I said with dignity. â€œKindly get off.â€

â€œNo?â€ he repeated, not moving.

â€œYes! All right! Yes! Will you bloody get off?!â€

He didnâ€™t get off, but bent his head and kissed me. I was close-lipped, determined not to give in, but he was determined, too, and if one came right down to it . . . the skin of his face was warm, the plush of his beard stubble softly scratchy, and his wide sweet mouth . . . My legs were open in abandon and he was solid between them, bare chest smelling of musk and sweat and sawdust caught in the wiry auburn hair. . . . I was still hot with struggling, but the grass was damp and cool around us. . . . Well, all right; another minute, and he could have me right there, if he cared to.

He felt me yield, and sighed, letting his own body slacken; he no longer held me prisoner, but simply held me. He lifted his head then, and cupped my face with one hand.

â€œDâ€™ye want to know what it is, really?â€ he asked, and I could see from the dark blue of his eyes that he meant it. I nodded, mute.

â€œAbove all creatures on this earth,â€ he whispered, â€œyou are faithful.â€

I thought of saying something about St. Bernard dogs, but there was such tenderness in his face that I said nothing, instead merely staring up at him, blinking against the green light that filtered through the needles overhead.

â€œWell,â€ I said at last, with a deep sigh of my own, â€œso are you. Quite a good thing, really. Isnâ€™t it?â€

WE HAVE IGNITION




MRS. BUG HAD MADE chicken fricassee for supper, but that wasnâ€™t sufficient to account for the air of suppressed excitement that Bree and Roger brought with them when they came in. They were both smiling, her cheeks were flushed, and his eyes as bright as hers.

So when Roger announced that they had great news, it was perhaps only reasonable that Mrs. Bug should leap directly to the obvious conclusion.

â€œYouâ€™re wiâ€™ child again!â€ she cried, dropping a spoon in her excitement. She clapped her hands together, inflating like a birthday balloon. â€œOh, the joy of it! And about time, too,â€ she added, letting go her hands to wag a finger at Roger. â€œAnd here was me thinkinâ€™ as I should add a bit oâ€™ ginger and brimstone to your parritch, young man, so as to bring ye up to scratch! But ye kent your business weel enough in the end, I see. And you, a bhailach, what dâ€™ye think? A bonny wee brother for ye!â€

Jemmy, thus addressed, stared up at her, mouth open.

â€œEr . . .â€ said Roger, flushing up.

â€œOr, of course, it might be a wee sister, I suppose,â€ Mrs. Bug admitted. â€œBut good news, good news, either way. Here, a luaidh, have a sweetie on the strength of it, and the rest of us will drink to it!â€

Obviously bewildered, but strongly in favor of sweeties, Jem took the proffered molasses drop and stuck it promptly in his mouth.

â€œBut he isnâ€™tâ€”â€ Bree began.

â€œNank you, Missus Bug,â€ Jem said hastily, putting a hand over his mouth lest his mother try to repossess this distinctly forbidden predinner treat on grounds of impoliteness.

â€œOh, a wee sweetie will do him nay harm,â€ Mrs. Bug assured her, picking up the fallen spoon and wiping it on her apron. â€œCall Arch in, a muirninn, and weâ€™ll tell him your news. Blessed Bride save ye, lass, I thought yeâ€™d never get round to it! Here was all the ladies sayingâ€™ as they didna ken whether yeâ€™d turned cold to your husband, or was it him maybe, lackinâ€™ the vital spark, but as it isâ€”â€

â€œWell, as it is,â€ said Roger, raising his voice in order to be heard.

â€œIâ€™m not pregnant!â€ said Bree, very loudly.

The succeeding silence echoed like a thunderclap.

â€œOh,â€ said Jamie mildly. He picked up a serviette and sat down, tucking it into the neck of his shirt. â€œWell, then. Shall we eat?â€ He held out a hand to Jem, who scrambled up onto the bench beside him, still sucking fiercely on his molasses drop.

Mrs. Bug, momentarily turned to stone, revived with a marked â€œHmpf!â€ Massively affronted, she turned to the sideboard and slapped down a stack of pewter plates with a clatter.

Roger, still rather flushed, appeared to find the situation funny, judging from the twitching of his mouth. Brianna was incandescent, and breathing like a grampus.

â€œSit down, darling,â€ I said, in the tentative manner of one addressing a large explosive device. â€œYou . . . um . . . had some news, you said?â€

â€œNever mind!â€ She stood still, glaring. â€œNobody cares, since Iâ€™m not pregnant. After all, what else could I possibly do that anybody would think was worthwhile?â€ She shoved a violent hand through her hair, and encountering the ribbon tying it back, yanked this loose and flung it on the ground.

â€œNow, sweetheart . . .â€ Roger began. I could have told him this was a mistake; Frasers in a fury tended to pay no attention to honeyed words, being instead inclined to go for the throat of the nearest party unwary enough to speak to them.

â€œDonâ€™t you â€˜sweetheartâ€™ me!â€ she snapped, turning on him. â€œYou think so, too! You think everything I do is a waste of time if it isnâ€™t washing clothes or cooking dinner or mending your effing socks! And you blame me for not getting pregnant, too, you think itâ€™s my fault! Well, itâ€™s NOT, and you know it!â€

â€œNo! I donâ€™t think that, I donâ€™t at all. Brianna, please. . . .â€ He stretched out a hand to her, then thought better of the gesture and withdrew it, clearly feeling that she might take his hand off at the wrist.

â€œLess EAT, Mummy!â€ Jemmy piped up helpfully. A long string of molasses-tinged saliva flowed from the corner of his mouth and dripped down the front of his shirt. Seeing this, his mother turned on Mrs. Bug like a tiger.

â€œNow see what youâ€™ve done, you interfering old busybody! That was his last clean shirt! And how dare you talk about our private lives with everybody in sight, what possible earthly business of yours is it, you beastly old gossipingâ€”â€

Seeing the futility of protest, Roger put his arms round her from behind, picked her up bodily off the floor, and carried her out the back door, this departure accented by incoherent protests from Bree and grunts of pain from Roger, as she kicked him repeatedly in the shins, with considerable force and accuracy.

I went to the door and closed it delicately, shutting off the sounds of further altercation in the yard.

â€œShe gets that from you, you know,â€ I said reproachfully, sitting down opposite Jamie. â€œMrs. Bug, that smells wonderful. Do letâ€™s eat!â€

Mrs. Bug dished the fricassee in huffy silence, but declined to join us at table, instead putting on her cloak and stamping out the front door, leaving us to deal with the clearing-up. An excellent bargain, if you asked me.

We ate in blissful peace, the quiet broken only by the clink of spoons on pewter and the occasional question from Jemmy as to why molasses was sticky, how did milk get into the cow, and when would he get his little brother?

â€œWhat am I going to say to Mrs. Bug?â€ I asked, in the brief hiatus between queries.

â€œWhy ought ye to say anything, Sassenach? It wasna you calling her names.â€

â€œWell, no. But Iâ€™d be willing to bet that Brianna isnâ€™t going to apologizeâ€”â€

â€œWhy should she?â€ He shrugged. â€œShe was provoked, after all. And I canna think Mrs. Bug has lived sae long without being called a gossiping busybody before. Sheâ€™ll wear herself out, telling Arch all about it, and tomorrow it will be fine again.â€

â€œWell,â€ I said uncertainly. â€œPerhaps so. But Bree and Rogerâ€”â€

He smiled at me, dark blue eyes crinkling into triangles.

â€œDinna feel as though every disaster is yours to fash yourself about, mo chridhe,â€ he said. He reached across and patted my hand. â€œRoger Mac and the lass must work it out between themâ€”and the lad did appear to have a decent grip on the situation.â€

He laughed, and I joined him, reluctantly.

â€œWell, it will be mine to fash about, if sheâ€™s broken his leg,â€ I remarked, getting up to fetch cream for the coffee. â€œLikely heâ€™ll come crawling back to have it mended.â€

At this apropos moment, a knock sounded on the back door. Wondering why Roger would knock, I opened it, and stared in astonishment at the pale face of Thomas Christie.



HE WAS NOT ONLY PALE, but sweating, and had a bloodstained cloth wrapped round one hand.

â€œI wouldna discommode ye, mistress,â€ he said, holding himself stiffly. â€œIâ€™ll just . . . wait upon your convenience.â€

â€œNonsense,â€ I said, rather shortly. â€œCome into the surgery while thereâ€™s still some light.â€

I took care not to catch Jamieâ€™s eye directly, but I glanced at him as I bent to push in the bench. He was leaning forward to put a saucer over my coffee, his eyes on Tom Christie with an air of thoughtful speculation that I had last seen in a bobcat watching a flight of ducks overhead. Not urgent, but definitely taking notice.

Christie was taking no notice of anything beyond his injured hand, reasonably enough. My surgeryâ€™s windows were oriented to east and south, to take best advantage of morning light, but even near sunset, the room held a soft radianceâ€”the setting sunâ€™s reflection from the shimmering leaves of the chestnut grove. Everything in the room was suffused with golden light, save Tom Christieâ€™s face, which was noticeably green.

â€œSit down,â€ I said, shoving a stool hastily behind him. His knees buckled as he lowered himself; he landed harder than he had intended, jarring his hand, and let out a small exclamation of pain.

I put a thumb on the big vein at the wrist, to help slow the bleeding, and unwound the cloth. Given his aspect, I was expecting a severed finger or two, and was surprised to find a simple gash in the meat at the base of the thumb, angled down and running onto the wrist. It was deep enough to gape, and still bleeding freely, but no major vessels had been cut, and he had by great good fortune only nicked the thumb tendon; I could mend that with a stitch or two.

I looked up to tell him this, only to see his eyes roll back in his head.

â€œHelp!â€ I shouted, dropping the hand and grabbing for his shoulders as he toppled backward.

A crash of overturned bench and the thump of running feet answered my call, and Jamie burst into the room in a heartbeat. Seeing me dragged off my feet by Christieâ€™s weight, he seized the man by the scruff of the neck and shoved him forward like a rag doll, pushing Christieâ€™s head down between his legs.

â€œIs he desperate bad?â€ Jamie asked, squinting at Christieâ€™s injured hand, which was resting on the floor, oozing blood. â€œShall I lay him on the table?â€

â€œI donâ€™t think so.â€ I had a hand under Christieâ€™s jaw, feeling for his pulse. â€œHeâ€™s not hurt badly; heâ€™s only fainted. Yes, see, heâ€™s coming round. Keep your head down for a bit, now, youâ€™ll be quite all right in a moment.â€ I addressed this latter remark to Christie, who was breathing like a steam engine, but had steadied a little.

Jamie removed his hand from Christieâ€™s neck, and wiped it on his kilt with an expression of mild distaste. Christie had broken out in a profuse cold sweat; I could feel my own hand slimy with it, but picked up the fallen cloth and wiped my hand more tactfully with that.

â€œWould you like to lie down?â€ I asked, bending to look at Christieâ€™s face. He was still a ghastly color, but shook his head.

â€œNo, mistress. Iâ€™m quite all right. Only taken queer for a moment.â€ He spoke hoarsely, but firmly enough, so I contented myself with pressing the cloth hard against the wound to stanch the dripping blood.

Jemmy was loitering in the doorway, wide-eyed, but showing no particular alarm; blood was nothing new to him.

â€œShall I fetch ye a dram, Tom?â€ Jamie said, eyeing the patient warily. â€œI ken ye dinna hold wiâ€™ strong drink, but thereâ€™s a time for it, surely?â€

Christieâ€™s mouth worked a little, but he shook his head.

â€œI . . . no. Perhaps . . . a little wine?â€

â€œTake a little wine for thy stomachâ€™s sake, eh? Aye, fine. Take heart, man, Iâ€™ll fetch it.â€ Jamie clapped him encouragingly on the shoulder, and went briskly off, taking Jemmy by the hand as he went out.

Christieâ€™s mouth tightened in a grimace. I had noticed before that like some Protestants, Tom Christie regarded the Bible as being a document addressed specifically to himself and confided to his personal care for prudent distribution to the masses. Thus, he quite disliked hearing Catholicsâ€”i.e., Jamieâ€”quoting casually from it. I had also noticed that Jamie was aware of this, and took every opportunity to make such quotes.

â€œWhat happened?â€ I asked, as much to distract Christie as because I wished to know.

Christie broke off his glower at the empty doorway and glanced at his left handâ€”then hastily away, going pale again.

â€œAn accident,â€ he said gruffly. â€œI was cutting rushes; the knife slipped.â€ His right hand flexed slightly as he said this, and I glanced at it.

â€œNo bloody wonder!â€ I said. â€œHere, keep that up in the air.â€ I lifted the injured left hand, tightly wrapped, above his head, let go of it, and reached for the other.

He had been suffering from a condition in the right hand called Dupuytrenâ€™s contractureâ€”or at least it would be called that, once Baron Dupuytren got round to describing it in another sixty or seventy years. Caused by a thickening and shortening of the fibrous sheet that kept the handâ€™s tendons in place when the fingers flexed, the result of it was to draw the ring finger in toward the palm of the hand. In advanced cases, the little finger and sometimes the middle finger as well were involved. Tom Christieâ€™s case had advanced quite a bit since I had last had the chance of a good look at his hand.

â€œDid I tell you?â€ I demanded rhetorically, pulling gently on the clawed fingers. The middle finger could still be halfway unfolded; the ring and little fingers could barely be lifted away from the palm. â€œI said it would get worse. No wonder the knife slippedâ€”Iâ€™m surprised you could even hold it.â€

A slight flush appeared under the clipped salt-and-pepper beard, and he glanced away.

â€œI could have taken care of it easily months ago,â€ I said, turning the hand to look critically at the angle of contracture. â€œIt would have been a very simple matter. Now it will be rather more complicatedâ€”but I can still correct it, I think.â€

Had he been a less stolid man, I should have described him as wriggling with embarrassment. As it was, he merely twitched slightly, the flush deepening over his face.

â€œIâ€”I do not desireâ€”â€

â€œI donâ€™t bloody care what you desire,â€ I told him, putting the clawed hand back in his lap. â€œIf you donâ€™t allow me to operate on that hand, it will be all but useless inside six months. You can barely write with it now, am I right?â€

His eyes met mine, deep gray and startled.

â€œI can write,â€ he said, but I could tell that the belligerence in his voice hid a deep uneasiness. Tom Christie was an educated man, a scholar, and the Ridgeâ€™s schoolteacher. It was to him that many of the Ridge people went for help in the composition of letters or legal documents. He took great pride in this; I knew the threat of loss of this ability was the best lever I hadâ€”and it was no idle threat.

â€œNot for long,â€ I said, and widened my eyes at him to make my meaning clear. He swallowed uneasily, but before he could reply, Jamie reappeared, holding a jug of wine.

â€œBest listen to her,â€ he advised Christie, setting it on the counter. â€œI ken what itâ€™s like to try to write wiâ€™ a stiff finger, aye?â€ He held up his own right hand and flexed it, looking rueful. â€œIf she could mend that wiâ€™ her wee knife, Iâ€™d lay my hand on the block this instant.â€

Jamieâ€™s problem was almost the reverse of Christieâ€™s, though the effect was quite similar. The ring finger had been smashed so badly that the joints had frozen; it could not be bent. Consequently, the two fingers on either side had limited motion, as well, though the joint capsules were intact.

â€œThe difference being that your hand isnâ€™t getting any worse,â€ I told Jamie. â€œHis is.â€

Christie made a small movement, pushing his right hand down between his thighs, as though to hide it.

â€œAye, well,â€ he said uncomfortably. â€œIt can bide awhile, surely.â€

â€œAt least long enough to let my wife mend the other,â€ Jamie observed, pouring out a cup of wine. â€œHereâ€”can ye hold it, Tom, or shall Iâ€”?â€ He made a questioning gesture, holding the cup as though to feed it to Christie, who snatched his right hand out of the sheltering folds of his clothes.

â€œIâ€™ll manage,â€ he snapped, and took the wineâ€”holding the cup between thumb and forefinger with an awkwardness that made him flush even more deeply. His left hand still hung in the air above his shoulder. He looked foolish, and obviously felt it.

Jamie poured another cup and handed it to me, ignoring Christie. I would have thought it natural tact on his part, were I not aware of the complicated history between the two men. There was always a small barbed edge in any dealings between Jamie and Tom Christie, though they managed to keep an outwardly cordial face on things.

With any other man, Jamieâ€™s display of his own injured hand would have been just what it seemedâ€”reassurance, and the offering of fellowship in infirmity. With Tom Christie, it might have been consciously meant as reassurance, but there was a threat implied, as well, though perhaps Jamie couldnâ€™t help that.

The simple fact was that people came to Jamie for help more often than they did to Christie. Jamie had widespread respect and admiration, despite his crippled hand. Christie was not a personally popular man; he might well lose what social position he had, if he lost his ability to write. Andâ€”as I had bluntly notedâ€”Jamieâ€™s hand would not get worse.

Christieâ€™s eyes had narrowed a little over his cup. He hadnâ€™t missed the threat, whether intended or not. He wouldnâ€™t; Tom Christie was a suspicious man by nature, and inclined to see threat where it wasnâ€™t intended.

â€œI think thatâ€™s settled a bit by now; let me take care of it.â€ I took hold of his left hand, gently, and unwrapped it. The bleeding had stopped. I set the hand to soak in a bowl of water boiled with garlic, added a few drops of pure ethanol for additional disinfection, and set about gathering my kit.

It was beginning to grow dark, and I lit the alcohol lamp Brianna had made for me. By its bright, steady flame, I could see that Christieâ€™s face had lost its momentary flush of anger. He wasnâ€™t as pale as he had been, but looked uneasy as a vole at a convention of badgers, his eyes following my hands as I laid out my sutures, needles, and scissors, all clean and gleaming-sharp in the light.

Jamie didnâ€™t leave, but stayed leaning against the counter, sipping his own cup of wineâ€”presumably, in case Christie passed out again.

A fine trembling ran through Christieâ€™s hand and arm, braced as they were on the table. He was sweating again; I could smell it, acrid and bitter. It was the scent of that, half-forgotten, but immediately familiar, that finally made me realize the difficulty: it was fear. He was afraid of blood, perhaps; afraid of pain, certainly.

I kept my eyes fixed on my work, bending my head lower to keep him from seeing anything in my face. I should have seen it sooner; I would have, I thought, had he not been a man. His paleness, the fainting . . . not due to loss of blood, but to shock at seeing blood lost.

I stitched up men and boys routinely; mountain farming was rough work, and it was a rare week when I wasnâ€™t presented with ax wounds, hoe gouges, spud slashes, hog bites, scalp lacerations sustained while falling over something, or some other minor calamity requiring stitches. By and large, all my patients behaved with complete matter-of-factness, accepting my ministrations stoically, and going right back to work. But nearly all of the men were Highlanders, I realized, and many not only Highlanders but erstwhile soldiers.

Tom Christie was a townsman, from Edinburghâ€”he had been imprisoned in Ardsmuir as a Jacobite supporter, but had never been a fighting man. He had been a commissary officer. In fact, I realized with surprise, he had likely never even seen a real military battle, let alone engaged in the daily physical conflict with nature that Highland farming entailed.

I became aware of Jamie, still standing in the shadows, sipping wine and watching with a faintly ironic dispassion. I glanced up quickly at him; his expression didnâ€™t alter, though he met my eyes and nodded, very slightly.

Tom Christieâ€™s lip was fixed between his teeth; I could hear the faint whistle of his breath. He couldnâ€™t see Jamie, but knew he was there; the stiffness of his back said as much. He might be afraid, Tom Christie, but he had some courage to him.

It would have hurt him less, could he have relaxed the clenched muscles of arm and hand. Under the circumstances, though, I could hardly suggest as much. I could have insisted that Jamie leave, but I was nearly finished. With a sigh of mingled exasperation and puzzlement, I clipped the final knot and laid down the scissors.

â€œAll right, then,â€ I said, swiping the last of the coneflower ointment across the wound and reaching for a clean linen bandage. â€œKeep it clean. Iâ€™ll make up some fresh ointment for you; send Malva for it. Then come back in a week and Iâ€™ll take the stitches out.â€ I hesitated, glancing at Jamie. I felt some reluctance to use his presence as blackmail, but it was for Christieâ€™s own good.

â€œIâ€™ll take care of your right hand, then, too, shall I?â€ I said firmly.

He was still sweating, though the color in his face had begun to come back. He glanced at me, and then, involuntarily, at Jamie.

Jamie smiled faintly.

â€œGo on, then, Tom,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s naught to trouble ye. No but a wee nick. Iâ€™ve had worse.â€

The words were spoken casually, but they might as well have been written in flaming letters a foot high. Iâ€™ve had worse.

Jamieâ€™s face was still in shadow, but his eyes were clearly visible, slanted with his smile.

Tom Christie had not relaxed his rigid posture. He matched Jamieâ€™s stare, closing his gnarled right hand over the bandaged left.

â€œAye,â€ he said. â€œWell.â€ He was breathing deeply. â€œI will, then.â€ He rose abruptly, knocking the stool aside, and headed for the door, a little off-balance, like a man the worse for strong drink.

At the door, he paused, fumbling for the knob. Finding it, he drew himself up and turned back, looking for Jamie.

â€œAt least,â€ he said, breathing so hard that he stumbled over the words, â€œat least it will be an honorable scar. Wonâ€™t it, Mac Dubh?â€

Jamie straightened up abruptly, but Christie was already out, stamping down the corridor with a step heavy enough to rattle the pewter plates on the kitchen shelf.

â€œWhy, ye wee pissant!â€ he said, in a tone somewhere between anger and astonishment. His left hand clenched involuntarily into a fist, and I thought it a good thing that Christie had made such a rapid exit.

I was rather unsure as to exactly what had happenedâ€”or been happeningâ€”but relieved that Christie was gone. Iâ€™d felt like a handful of grain, trapped between two grindstones, both of them trying to grind each otherâ€™s faces, with no heed for the hapless corn in between.

â€œIâ€™ve never heard Tom Christie call you Mac Dubh,â€ I observed cautiously, turning to tidy away my surgical leavings. Christie was not, of course, a Gaelic-speaker, but I had never heard him use even the Gaelic nickname that the other Ardsmuir men still called Jamie by. Christie always called Jamie â€œMr. Fraser,â€ or simply â€œFraser,â€ in moments of what passed for cordiality.

Jamie made a derisive Scottish noise, then picked up Christieâ€™s half-full cup and thriftily drained it.

â€œNo, he wouldnaâ€”frigging Sassenach.â€ Then he caught a glimpse of my face, and gave me a lopsided smile. â€œI didna mean you, Sassenach.â€

I knew he didnâ€™t mean me; the word was spoken with a completely differentâ€”and quite shockingâ€”intonation; a bitterness that reminded me that â€œSassenachâ€ was by no means a friendly term in normal usage.

â€œWhy do you call him that?â€ I asked curiously. â€œAnd just what did he mean by that â€˜honorable scarâ€™ crack?â€

He looked down, and didnâ€™t answer for a moment, though the stiffened fingers of his right hand drummed soundlessly against his thigh.

â€œTom Christieâ€™s a solid man,â€ he said at last. â€œBut by God, he is a stiff-necked wee son of a bitch!â€ He looked up then, and smiled at me, a little ruefully.

â€œEight years he lived in a cell wiâ€™ forty men who had the Gaelicâ€”and he wouldna lower himself to let a word of such a barbarous tongue pass his lips! Christ, no. Heâ€™d speak in English, no matter who it was he spoke to, and if it was a man who had no English, why, then, heâ€™d just stand there, dumb as a stone, â€™til someone came along to interpret for him.â€

â€œSomeone like you?â€

â€œNow and then.â€ He glanced toward the window, as though to catch a glimpse of Christie, but the night had come down altogether, and the panes gave back only a dim reflection of the surgery, our own forms ghostlike in the glass.

â€œRoger did say that Kenny Lindsay mentioned something about Mr. Christieâ€™s . . . pretensions,â€ I said delicately.

Jamie shot me a sharp glance at that.

â€œOh, he did, did he? So, Roger Mac had second thoughts about his wisdom in taking on Christie as a tenant, I suppose. Kenny wouldna have said, unless he was asked.â€

I had more or less got used to the speed of his deductions and the accuracy of his insights, and didnâ€™t question this one.

â€œYou never told me about that,â€ I said, coming to stand in front of him. I put my hands on his chest, looking up into his face.

He put his own hands over mine, and sighed, deep enough for me to feel the movement of his chest. Then he wrapped his arms around me, and drew me close, so my face rested against the warm fabric of his shirt.

â€œAye, well. It wasna really important, ken.â€

â€œAnd you didnâ€™t want to think about Ardsmuir, perhaps?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said softly. â€œI have had enough of the past.â€

My hands were on his back now, and I realized suddenly what Christie had likely meant. I could feel the lines of the scars through the linen, clear to my fingertips as the lines of a fishnet, laid across his skin.

â€œHonorable scars!â€ I said, lifting my head. â€œWhy, that little bastard! Is that what he meant?â€

Jamie smiled a little at my indignation.

â€œAye, he did,â€ he said dryly. â€œThatâ€™s why he called me Mac Dubhâ€”to remind me of Ardsmuir, so Iâ€™d ken for sure what he meant by it. He saw me flogged there.â€

â€œThatâ€”thatâ€”â€ I was so angry, I could barely speak. â€œI wish Iâ€™d stitched his fucking hand to his balls!â€

â€œAnd you a physician, sworn to do nay harm? Iâ€™m verra much shocked, Sassenach.â€

He was laughing now, but I wasnâ€™t amused at all.

â€œBeastly little coward! Heâ€™s afraid of blood, did you know that?â€

â€œWell, aye, I did. Ye canna live in a manâ€™s oxter for three years without learning a great many things ye dinna want to know about him, let alone something like that.â€ He sobered a bit, though a hint of wryness still lurked at the corner of his mouth. â€œWhen they brought me back from being whipped, he went white as suet, went and puked in the corner, then lay down with his face to the wall. I wasna really taking notice, but I remember thinking that was a bit raw; I was the one was a bloody mess, why was he takinâ€™ on like a lass wiâ€™ the vapors?â€

I snorted. â€œDonâ€™t you go making jokes about it! How dare he? And what does he mean, anywayâ€”I know what happened at Ardsmuir, and those bloody well . . . I mean, those certainly are honorable scars, and everyone there knew it!â€

â€œAye, maybe,â€ he said, all hint of laughter disappearing. â€œThat time. But everyone could see when they stood me up that Iâ€™d been flogged before, aye? And no man there has ever said a word to me about those scars. Not â€™til now.â€

That brought me up short.

Flogging wasnâ€™t merely brutal; it was shamefulâ€”meant to permanently disfigure, as well as to hurt, advertising a criminalâ€™s past as clearly as a branded cheek or cropped ear. And Jamie would, of course, prefer to have his tongue torn out by the roots, sooner than reveal to anyone the reasons for his scars, even if that meant leaving everyone with the assumption that he had been flogged for some disgraceful act.

I was so used to Jamieâ€™s always keeping his shirt on in anyone elseâ€™s presence that it had never occurred to me that of course the Ardsmuir men would know about the scars on his back. And yet he hid them, and everyone pretended they did not existâ€”save Tom Christie.

â€œHmph,â€ I said. â€œWell . . . God damn the man, anyway. Why would he say such a thing?â€

Jamie uttered a short laugh.

â€œBecause he didna like me watching him sweat. He wanted a bit of his own back, I expect.â€

â€œHmph,â€ I said again, and folded my arms beneath my bosom. â€œSince you mention itâ€”why did you do that? If you knew he couldnâ€™t stand blood and the like, I mean, why stay and watch him like that?â€

â€œBecause I kent he wouldna whimper or faint if I did,â€ he replied. â€œHeâ€™d let ye thrust red-hot needles through his eyeballs before heâ€™d squeal in front of me.â€

â€œOh, so you noticed that?â€

â€œWell, of course I did, Sassenach. What dâ€™ye think I was there for? Not that I dinna appreciate your skill, but watching ye stitch up wounds isna really good for the digestion.â€ He cast a brief glance at the discarded cloth, splotched with blood, and grimaced. â€œDâ€™ye think the coffeeâ€™s gone cold by now?â€

â€œIâ€™ll heat it up.â€ I slid the clean scissors back into their sheath, then sterilized the needle Iâ€™d used, ran a fresh silk suture through it, and coiled it up in its jar of alcoholâ€”still trying to make sense of things.

I put everything back into the cupboard, then turned to Jamie.

â€œYou arenâ€™t afraid of Tom Christie, are you?â€ I demanded.

He blinked, astonished, then laughed.

â€œChrist, no. What makes ye think that, Sassenach?â€

â€œWell . . . the way the two of you act sometimes. Itâ€™s like wild sheep, butting heads to see whoâ€™s stronger.â€

â€œOh, that.â€ He waved a hand, dismissive. â€œIâ€™ve a harder head by far than Tom, and he kens it well enough. But heâ€™s no going to give in and follow me round like a yearling lamb, either.â€

â€œOh? But what do you think youâ€™re doing, then? You werenâ€™t just torturing him to prove you could, were you?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, and smiled faintly at me. â€œA man stubborn enough to speak English to Hieland men in prison for eight years is a man stubborn enough to fight beside me for the next eight years; thatâ€™s what I think. It would be good if he were sure of it, himself, though.â€

I drew a deep breath and sighed, shaking my head.

â€œI do not understand men.â€

That made him chuckle, deep in his chest.

â€œYes, ye do, Sassenach. Ye only wish ye didnâ€™t.â€

The surgery lay neat again, ready for whatever emergencies the morrow might bring. Jamie reached for the lamp, but I laid a hand on his arm, stopping him.

â€œYou promised me honesty,â€ I said. â€œBut are you quite sure youâ€™re being honest with yourself? You werenâ€™t baiting Tom Christie just because he challenges you?â€

He stopped, his eyes clear and unguarded, a few inches from mine. He lifted a hand and cupped the side of my face, his palm warm on my skin.

â€œThere are only two people in this world to whom I would never lie, Sassenach,â€ he said softly. â€œYeâ€™re one of them. And Iâ€™m the other.â€

He kissed me gently on the forehead, then leaned past me and blew out the lamp.

â€œMind,â€ his voice came from the darkness, and I saw his tall form silhouetted against the faint oblong of light from the doorway as he straightened up, â€œI can be fooled. But I wouldna be doing it on purpose.â€



ROGER MOVED a little, and groaned.

â€œI think ye broke my leg.â€

â€œDid not,â€ said his wife, calmer now, but still disposed to argument. â€œBut Iâ€™ll kiss it for you, if you want.â€

â€œThatâ€™d be nice.â€

Tremendous rustlings of the corn-shuck mattress ensued as she clambered into position to execute this treatment, ending with a naked Brianna straddling his chest, and leaving him with a view that caused him to wish theyâ€™d taken time to light the candle.

She was in fact kissing his shins, which tickled. Given the circumstances, though, he was inclined to put up with it. He reached up with both hands. Lacking light, Braille would do.

â€œWhen I was fourteen or so,â€ he said dreamily, â€œone of the shops in Inverness had a most daring window displayâ€”daring for the times, that isâ€”a lady mannequin wearing nothing but underwear.â€

â€œMm?â€

â€œAye, a full-length pink girdle, garters, the lotâ€”with matching brassiere. Everyone was shocked. Committees were got up to protest, and calls were made to all the ministers in town. Next day, they took it down, but meanwhile, the entire male population of Inverness had been past that window, taking pains to look casual about it. â€™Til this minute, Iâ€™d always thought that was the most erotic thing Iâ€™d ever seen.â€

She suspended her operations for a moment, and he thought from the sense of movement that she was looking back over her shoulder at him.

â€œRoger,â€ she said thoughtfully. â€œI do believe youâ€™re a pervert.â€

â€œYes, but one with really good night vision.â€

That made her laughâ€”the thing heâ€™d been striving for since heâ€™d finally got her to stop frothing at the mouthâ€”and he raised himself briefly, planting a light kiss on either side of the looming object of his affections before sinking contentedly back onto the pillow.

She kissed his knee, then put her head down, cheek against his thigh, so the mass of her hair spilled over his legs, cool and soft as a cloud of silk threads.

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ she said softly, after a moment.

He made a dismissive noise, and ran a soothing hand over the round of her hip.

â€œOch, itâ€™s no matter. Too bad, though; I wanted to see their faces when they saw what yeâ€™d done.â€

She snorted briefly, and his leg twitched at the warmth of her breath.

â€œTheir faces were something to see, anyway.â€ She sounded a little bleak. â€œAnd it would have been a real anticlimax, after that.â€

â€œWell, youâ€™re right about that,â€ he admitted. â€œBut yeâ€™ll show them tomorrow, when theyâ€™re in a frame of mind to appreciate it properly.â€

She sighed, and kissed his knee again.

â€œI didnâ€™t mean it,â€ she said, after a moment. â€œImplying it was your fault.â€

â€œAye, ye did,â€ he said softly, still caressing. â€œItâ€™s all right. Yeâ€™re probably right.â€ Likely she was. He wasnâ€™t going to pretend it hadnâ€™t hurt to hear it, but he wouldnâ€™t let himself be angry; that would help neither of them.

â€œYou donâ€™t know that.â€ She raised up suddenly, looming like an obelisk in silhouette against the pale rectangle of the window. Swinging one leg neatly over his supine body, she slithered down beside him. â€œIt could be me. Or neither of us. Maybe it just isnâ€™t the right time, yet.â€

He put an arm around her and hugged her close in answer.

â€œWhatever the cause, weâ€™ll not blame each other, aye?â€ She made a small sound of assent and nestled closer. Well enough; there was no way to keep from blaming himself, though.

The facts were clear enough; sheâ€™d got pregnant with Jemmy after one nightâ€”whether with himself, or Stephen Bonnet, no one knew, but once was all it took. Whereas theyâ€™d been trying for the last several months, and Jem was looking more and more like being an only child. Possibly he did lack the vital spark, as Mrs. Bug and her chums speculated.

Whoâ€™s your Daddy? echoed mockingly in the back of his mindâ€”in an Irish accent.

He coughed explosively, and settled back, determined not to dwell on that little matter.

â€œWell, Iâ€™m sorry, too,â€ he said, changing the subject. â€œYeâ€™re maybe right about me acting like Iâ€™d rather ye cook and clean than mess about with your wee chemistry set.â€

â€œOnly because you would,â€ she said without rancor.

â€œItâ€™s not so much the not cooking as it is the setting things on fire I mind.â€

â€œWell, youâ€™ll love the next project, then,â€ she said, nuzzling his shoulder. â€œItâ€™s mostly water.â€

â€œOh . . . good,â€ he said, though even he could hear the dubious note in his voice. â€œMostly?â€

â€œThereâ€™s some dirt involved, too.â€

â€œNothing that burns?â€

â€œJust wood. A little. Nothing special.â€

She was running her fingers slowly down his chest. He caught her hand and kissed her fingertips; they were smooth, but hard, callused from the constant spinning she did to help keep them clothed.

â€œWho can find a virtuous woman?â€ he quoted, â€œfor her price is far above rubies. She seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands. She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.â€

â€œI would love to find some dye plant that gives a true purple,â€ she said wistfully. â€œI miss the bright colors. Remember the dress I wore to the man-on-the-moon party? The black one, with the bands of Day-Glo pink and lime green?â€

â€œThat was pretty memorable, aye.â€ Privately, he thought the muted colors of homespun suited her much better; in skirts of rust and brown, jackets of gray and green, she looked like some exotic, lovely lichen.

Seized by the sudden desire to see her, he reached out, fumbling on the table by the bed. The little box was where sheâ€™d thrown it when they came back. Sheâ€™d designed it to be used in the dark, after all; a turn of the lid dispensed one of the small, waxy sticks, and the tiny strip of roughened metal glued to the side was cool to his hand.

A skritch! that made his heart leap with its simple familiarity, and the tiny flame appeared with a whiff of sulfurâ€”magic.

â€œDonâ€™t waste them,â€ she said, but smiled in spite of the protest, delighted at the sight as sheâ€™d been when she first showed him what sheâ€™d done.

Her hair was loose and clean, just washed; shimmering over the pale round of her shoulder, clouds of it lying soft over his chest, cinnamon and amber and roan and gold, sparked by the flame.

â€œShe does not fear the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet,â€ he said softly, his free hand round her, twining a lock near her face round his finger, twisting the tiny strand as heâ€™d seen her spin yarn.

The long lids of her eyes closed halfway, like a basking catâ€™s, but the smile remained on that wide, soft mouthâ€”those lips that hurt, then healed. The light glowed in her skin, bronzed the tiny brown mole beneath her right ear. He could have watched her forever, but the match was burning low. Just before the flame touched his fingers, she leaned forward and blew it out.

And in the smoke-wisped dark, whispered in his ear, â€œThe heart of her husband doth safely trust in her. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. So there.â€

ENSORCELLMENT




TOM CHRISTIE didnâ€™t come back to the surgery, but he did send his daughter, Malva, to get the ointment. The girl was dark-haired, slender, and quiet, but seemed intelligent. She paid close attention as I quizzed her on the look of the woundâ€”so far, so good, a bit of redness, but no suppuration, no reddish streaks up the armâ€”and gave her instructions on how to apply the ointment and change the dressing.

â€œGood, then,â€ I said, giving her the jar. â€œIf he should begin a fever, come and fetch me. Otherwise, make him come in a week, to have the stitches taken out.â€

â€œYes, maâ€™am, Iâ€™ll do that.â€ She didnâ€™t turn and go, though, but lingered, her gaze flickering over the mounds of drying herbs on the gauze racks and the implements of my surgery.

â€œDo you need something else, dear? Or did you have a question?â€ Sheâ€™d seemed to understand my instructions perfectly wellâ€”but perhaps she wanted to ask something more personal. After all, she had no mother . .

â€œWell, aye,â€ she said, and nodded at the table. â€œI only wonderedâ€”what is it that ye write in yon black book, maâ€™am?â€

â€œThis? Oh. Itâ€™s my surgical notes, and recipes . . . er . . . receipts, I mean, for medicines. See?â€ I turned the book round and opened it so that she could see the page where I had drawn a sketch of the damage to Miss Mouseâ€™s teeth.

Malvaâ€™s gray eyes were bright with curiosity, and she leaned forward to read, hands carefully folded behind her back as though afraid she might touch the book by accident.

â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ I said, a little amused by her caution. â€œYou can look through it, if you like.â€ I pushed it toward her, and she stepped back, startled. She glanced up at me, a look of doubt wrinkling her brow, but when I smiled at her, she took a tiny, excited breath, and reached out to turn a page.

â€œOh, look!â€ The page sheâ€™d turned to wasnâ€™t one of mine, but one of Daniel Rawlingsâ€™sâ€”it showed the removal of a dead child from the uterus, via the use of assorted tools of dilatation and curettage. I glanced at the page, and hastily away. Rawlings hadnâ€™t been an artist, but he had had a brutal knack for rendering the reality of a situation.

Malva didnâ€™t seem to be distressed by the drawings, though; she was bug-eyed with interest.

I began to be interested, too, watching covertly as she turned pages at random. She naturally paid most attention to the drawingsâ€”but she paused to read the descriptions and recipes, as well.

â€œWhy dâ€™ye write things down that yeâ€™ve done?â€ she asked, glancing up with raised eyebrows. â€œThe receipts, aye, I see ye might forget thingsâ€”but why dâ€™ye draw these pictures and write down the bits about how ye took off a toe wiâ€™ the frost-rot? Would ye do it differently, another time?â€

â€œWell, sometimes you might,â€ I said, laying aside the stalk of dried rosemary Iâ€™d been stripping of its needles. â€œSurgery isnâ€™t the same each time. All bodies are a bit different, and even though you may do the same basic procedure a dozen times, there will be a dozen things that happen differentlyâ€”sometimes only tiny things, sometimes big ones.

â€œBut I keep a record of what Iâ€™ve done for several reasons,â€ I added, pushing back my stool and coming round the table to stand beside her. I turned another few pages, stopping at the record I kept of old Grannie MacBethâ€™s complaintsâ€”a list so extensive that I had alphabetized it for my own convenience, beginning with Arthritisâ€”all joints, running through Dyspepsia, Earache, and Fainting, and then onward for most of two pages, terminating with Womb, prolapsed.

â€œPartly, itâ€™s so that Iâ€™ll know whatâ€™s been done for a particular person, and what happenedâ€”so that if they need treatment later, I can look back and have an accurate description of their earlier state. To compare, you see?â€

She nodded eagerly.

â€œAye, I see. So yeâ€™d know were they getting better or worse. What else, then?â€

â€œWell, the most important reason,â€ I said slowly, seeking the right words, â€œis so that another doctorâ€”someone who might come laterâ€”so that person could read the record, and see how Iâ€™d done this or that. It might show them a way to do something they hadnâ€™t done themselvesâ€”or a better way.â€

Her mouth pursed up in interest.

â€œOoh! Ye mean someone might learn from thisâ€â€”she touched a finger to the page, delicatelyâ€”â€œhow to do what it is ye do? Without â€™prenticing himself to a doctor?â€

â€œWell, itâ€™s best if you have someone to teach you,â€ I said, amused at her eagerness. â€œAnd there are things you canâ€™t really learn from a book. But if thereâ€™s no one to learn fromâ€”â€ I glanced out the window, at the vista of green wilderness swarming over the mountains. â€œItâ€™s better than nothing,â€ I concluded.

â€œWhere did you learn?â€ she asked, curious. â€œFrom this book? I see thereâ€™s another hand, besides yours. Whose was it?â€

I ought to have seen that one coming. I hadnâ€™t quite bargained on Malva Christieâ€™s quickness, though.

â€œAh . . . I learned from a lot of books,â€ I said. â€œAnd from other doctors.â€

â€œOther doctors,â€ she echoed, looking at me in fascination. â€œDâ€™ye call yourself a doctor, then? I didna ken women ever could be.â€

For the rather good reason that no women did call themselves physicians or surgeons nowâ€”nor were accepted as such.

I coughed.

â€œWell . . . itâ€™s a name, thatâ€™s all. A good many people just say wisewoman, or conjure woman. Or ban-lichtne,â€ I added. â€œBut itâ€™s all the same, really. It only matters whether I know something that might help them.â€

â€œBanâ€”â€ She mouthed the unfamiliar word. â€œI havenâ€™t heard that before.â€

â€œItâ€™s the Gaelic. The Highland tongue, you know? It means â€˜female healerâ€™ or something like.â€

â€œOh, the Gaelic.â€ An expression of mild derision crossed her face; I expected she had absorbed her fatherâ€™s attitude toward the Highlandersâ€™ ancient language. She evidently saw something in my face, though, for she instantly erased the disdain from her own features and bent over the book again. â€œWho was it wrote these other bits, then?â€

â€œA man named Daniel Rawlings.â€ I smoothed a creased page, with the usual sense of affection for my predecessor. â€œHe was a doctor from Virginia.â€

â€œHim?â€ She looked up, surprised. â€œThe same whoâ€™s buried in the boneyard up the mountain?â€

â€œAh . . . yes, thatâ€™s him.â€ And the story of how he came to be there was not something to be shared with Miss Christie. I glanced out of the window, estimating the light. â€œWill your father be wanting his dinner?â€

â€œOh!â€ She stood up straight at that, glancing out the window, too, with a faint look of alarm. â€œAye, he will.â€ She cast a last look of longing toward the book, but then brushed down her skirt and set her cap straight, ready to go. â€œI thank ye, Mrs. Fraser, for showing me your wee book.â€

â€œHappy to,â€ I assured her sincerely. â€œYouâ€™re welcome to come again and look at it. In fact . . . would youâ€”â€ I hesitated, but plunged on, encouraged by her look of bright interest. â€œIâ€™m going to take a growth from Grannie Macbethâ€™s ear tomorrow. Would you like to come along with me, to see how? It would be a help to me, to have another pair of hands,â€ I added, seeing sudden doubt war with the interest in her eyes.

â€œOh, aye, Mrs. Fraserâ€”Iâ€™d dearly like it!â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s only my fatherâ€”â€ She looked uneasy as she said it, but then seemed to make up her mind. â€œWell . . . Iâ€™ll come. Iâ€™m sure I can talk him round.â€

â€œWould it help if I were to send a note? Or come and speak with him?â€ I was suddenly quite desirous that she should come with me.

She gave a small shake of the head.

â€œNay, maâ€™am, itâ€™ll be all right, Iâ€™m sure.â€ She dimpled at me suddenly, gray eyes sparkling. â€œIâ€™ll tell him Iâ€™ve had a keek at your black book, and itâ€™s no by way of being spells in it, at all, but only receipts for teas and purges. Iâ€™ll maybe not say about the drawings, though,â€ she added.

â€œSpells?â€ I asked incredulously. â€œIs that what he thought?â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ she assured me. â€œHe warned me not to touch it, for fear of ensorcellment.â€

â€œEnsorcellment,â€ I murmured, bemused. Well, Thomas Christie was a schoolmaster, after all. In fact, he might have been right, I thought; Malva glanced back at the book as I went with her to the door, obvious fascination on her face.

ANESTHESIA




I CLOSED MY EYES AND, holding my hand a foot or so in front of my face, wafted it gently toward my nose, like one of the parfumeurs Iâ€™d seen in Paris, testing a fragrance.

The smell hit me in the face like an ocean wave, and with approximately the same effect. My knees buckled, black lines writhed through my vision, and I ceased to make any distinction between up and down.

In what seemed an instant later, I came to, lying on the floor of the surgery with Mrs. Bug staring down at me in horror.

â€œMrs. Claire! Are ye all right, mo gaolach? I saw ye fallâ€”â€

â€œYes,â€ I croaked, shaking my head gingerly as I got up on one elbow. â€œPutâ€”put the cork in.â€ I gestured clumsily at the large open flask on the table, its cork lying alongside. â€œDonâ€™t get your face near it!â€

Face averted and screwed into a grimace of caution, she got the cork and inserted it, at armâ€™s length.

â€œPhew, what is yon stuff?â€ she said, stepping back and making faces. She sneezed explosively into her apron. â€œIâ€™ve never smelt anything like thatâ€”and Bride kens Iâ€™ve smelt a good many nasty things in this room!â€

â€œThat, my dear Mrs. Bug, is ether.â€ The swimming sensation in my head had almost disappeared, replaced by euphoria.

â€œEther?â€ She looked at the distilling apparatus on my counter in fascination, the alcohol bath bubbling gently away in its great glass bubble over a low flame and the oil of vitriolâ€”later to be known as sulfuric acidâ€”slicking its slow way down the slanted tubing, its malign hot scent lurking below the usual surgery smells of roots and herbs. â€œFancy! And whatâ€™s ether, then?â€

â€œIt puts people asleep, so they wonâ€™t feel pain when you cut them,â€ I explained, thrilled by my success. â€œAnd I know exactly who Iâ€™m going to use it on first!â€



â€œTOM CHRISTIE?â€ Jamie repeated. â€œHave ye told him?â€

â€œI told Malva. Sheâ€™s going to work on him; soften him up a bit.â€

Jamie snorted briefly at the thought.

â€œYe could boil Tom Christie in milk for a fortnight, and heâ€™d still be hard as a grindstone. And if ye think heâ€™ll listen to his wee lass prattle about a magic liquid that will put him to sleepâ€”â€

â€œNo, she isnâ€™t to tell him about the ether. Iâ€™ll do that,â€ I assured him. â€œSheâ€™s just going to pester him about his hand; convince him he needs it mended.â€

â€œMm.â€ Jamie still appeared dubious, though not, it seemed, entirely on Thomas Christieâ€™s account.

â€œThis ether yeâ€™ve made, Sassenach. Might ye not kill him with it?â€

I had, in fact, worried considerably about that very possibility. Iâ€™d done operations frequently where ether was used, and it was on the whole a fairly safe anesthetic. But homemade ether, administered by hand . . . and people did die of anesthetic accidents, even in the most careful settings, with trained anesthetists and all sorts of resuscitating equipment to hand. And I remembered Rosamund Lindsay, whose accidental death still haunted my dreams now and then. But the possibility of having a reliable anesthetic, of being able to do surgery without painâ€”

â€œI might,â€ I admitted. â€œI donâ€™t think so, but thereâ€™s always some risk. Worth it, though.â€

Jamie gave me a slightly jaundiced look.

â€œOh, aye? Does Tom think so?â€

â€œWell, weâ€™ll find out. Iâ€™ll explain it all carefully to him, and if he wonâ€™tâ€”well, he wonâ€™t. But I do hope he does!â€

The edge of Jamieâ€™s mouth curled up and he shook his head tolerantly.

â€œYeâ€™re like wee Jem wiâ€™ a new toy, Sassenach. Take care the wheels dinna come off.â€

I might have made some indignant reply to this, but we had come in sight of the Bugsâ€™ cabin, and Arch Bug was sitting on his stoop, peacefully smoking a clay pipe. He took this from his mouth and made to stand up when he saw us, but Jamie motioned him back.

â€œCiamar a tha thu, a charaid?â€

Arch replied with his customary â€œMmp,â€ infused with a tone of cordiality and welcome. A raised white brow in my direction, and a twiddle of the pipe stem toward the trail indicated that his wife was at our house, if thatâ€™s who I was looking for.

â€œNo, Iâ€™m just going into the woods to forage a bit,â€ I said, lifting my empty basket by way of evidence. â€œMrs. Bug forgot her needlework, thoughâ€”may I fetch it for her?â€

He nodded, eyes creasing as he smiled round his pipe. He shifted his lean buttocks courteously to allow me to go past him into the cabin. Behind me, I heard a â€œMmp?â€ of invitation, and felt the boards of the stoop shift as Jamie sat down beside Mr. Bug.

There were no windows, and I was obliged to stand still for a moment to let my eyes adjust to the dimness. It was a small cabin, though, and it took no more than half a minute before I could make out the contents: little more than the bed frame, a blanket chest, and a table with two stools. Mrs. Bugâ€™s workbag hung from a hook on the far wall, and I crossed to get it.

On the porch behind me, I heard the murmur of male conversation, featuring the quite unusual sound of Mr. Bugâ€™s voice. He could and did talk, of course, but Mrs. Bug talked so volubly that when she was present, her spouseâ€™s contribution was generally not much more than a smile and an occasional â€œmmpâ€ of accord or disagreement.

â€œYon Christie,â€ Mr. Bug was saying now, in a meditative tone of voice. â€œDâ€™ye find him strange, a Sheaumais?â€

â€œAye, well, heâ€™s a Lowlander,â€ Jamie said, with an audible shrug.

A humorous â€œmmpâ€ from Mr. Bug indicated that this was a perfectly sufficient explanation, and was succeeded by the sucking noises of a pipe being encouraged to draw.

I opened the bag, to be sure that the knitting was inside; in fact, it was not, and I was obliged to poke round the cabin, squinting in the dimness. Ohâ€”there it was; a dark puddle of something soft in the corner, fallen from the table and knocked aside by someoneâ€™s foot.

â€œIs he stranger than he might be, Christie?â€ I heard Jamie ask, his own tone casual.

I glanced through the door in time to see Arch Bug nod toward Jamie, though he didnâ€™t speak, being engaged in a fierce battle with his pipe. However, he raised his right hand and waggled it, displaying the stumps of his two missing fingers.

â€œAye,â€ he said finally, releasing a triumphant puff of white smoke with the word. â€œHe wished to ask me whether it hurt a good deal, when this was done.â€

His face wrinkled up like a paper bag, and he wheezed a littleâ€”high hilarity for Arch Bug.

â€œOh, aye? And what did ye tell him, then, Arch?â€ Jamie asked, smiling a little.

Arch sucked meditatively on his pipe, now fully cooperative, then pursed his lips and blew a small, perfect ring of smoke.

â€œWeeel, I said it didna hurt a bitâ€”at the time.â€ He paused, blue eyes twinkling. â€œOf course, that may have been because I was laid out cold as a mackerel from the shock of it. When I came round, it stung a bit.â€ He lifted the hand, looking it over dispassionately, then glanced through the door at me. â€œYe didna mean to use an ax on poor old Tom, did ye, maâ€™am? He says yeâ€™re set to mend his hand next week.â€

â€œProbably not. May I see?â€ I stepped out on the porch, bending to him, and he let me take the hand, obligingly switching his pipe to the left.

The index and middle finger had been severed cleanly, right at the knuckle. It was a very old injury; so old that it had lost that shocking look common to recent mutilations, where the mind still sees what should be there, and tries vainly for an instant to reconcile reality with expectation. The human body is amazingly plastic, though, and will compensate for missing bits as well as it can; in the case of a maimed hand, the remnant often undergoes a subtle sort of useful deformation, to maximize what function remains.

I felt along the hand carefully, fascinated. The metacarpals of the severed digits were intact, but the surrounding tissues had shrunk and twisted, withdrawing that part of the hand slightly, so that the remaining two fingers and the thumb could make a better opposition; Iâ€™d seen old Arch use that hand with perfect grace, holding a cup to drink, or wielding the handle of a spade.

The scars over the finger stumps had flattened and paled, forming a smooth, calloused surface. The remaining finger joints were knobbed with arthritis, and the hand as a whole was so twisted that it really didnâ€™t resemble a hand anymoreâ€”and yet it was not at all repulsive. It felt strong and warm in mine, and in fact, was oddly attractive, in the same way that a piece of weathered driftwood is.

â€œIt was done with an ax, you said?â€ I asked, wondering exactly how he had managed to inflict such an injury on himself, given that he was right-handed. A slippage might have gashed an arm or leg, but to take two fingers of the same hand right off like that . . . Realization dawned and my grasp tightened involuntarily. Oh, no.

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said, and exhaled a plume of smoke. I looked up, straight into his bright blue eyes.

â€œWho did it?â€ I asked.

â€œThe Frasers,â€ he said. He squeezed my hand gently, then withdrew his own and turned it to and fro. He glanced at Jamie.

â€œNot the Frasers of Lovat,â€ he assured him. â€œBobby Fraser of Glenhelm, and his nephew. Leslie, his name was.â€

â€œOh? Well, thatâ€™s good,â€ Jamie replied, one eyebrow lifted. â€œI shouldna like to hear it was close kin of mine.â€

Arch chuckled, almost soundlessly. His eyes still gleamed bright in their webs of wrinkled skin, but there was something in that laugh that made me want suddenly to step back a little.

â€œNo, ye wouldna,â€ he agreed. â€œNor me. But this was maybe the year ye would have been born, a Sheaumais, or a bit before. And there are no Frasers at Glenhelm now.â€

The hand itself had not troubled me at all, but the imagined vision of how it had got that way was making me a trifle faint. I sat down beside Jamie, not waiting for invitation.

â€œWhy?â€ I said bluntly. â€œHow?â€

He drew on his pipe, and blew another ring. It struck the remnants of the first and both disintegrated in a haze of fragrant smoke. He frowned a little, and glanced down at the hand, now resting on his knee.

â€œAh, well. It was my choice. We were bowmen, see,â€ he explained to me. â€œAll the men of my sept, we were brought up to it, early. Iâ€™d my first bow at three, and could strike a grouse through the heart at forty feet by the time I was six.â€

He spoke with an air of simple pride, squinting a little at a small flock of doves that were foraging under the trees nearby, as though estimating how easily he could have bagged one.

â€œI did hear my father tell of the archers,â€ Jamie said. â€œAt Glenshiels. Many of them Grants, he saidâ€”and some Campbells.â€ He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, interested in the story, but wary.

â€œAye, that was us.â€ Arch puffed industriously, smoke wreathing up round his head. â€œWeâ€™d crept down through the bracken in the night,â€ he explained to me, â€œand hid among the rocks above the river at Glenshiels, under the bracken and the rowans. Ye could have stood a foot away and not seen one of us, so thick as it was.

â€œA bit cramped,â€ he added confidentially to Jamie. â€œYe couldna stand up to take a piss, and weâ€™d had our suppersâ€”with a bit oâ€™ beerâ€”before we came up the other side oâ€™ the mountain. All squatting like women, we were. Trying like the devil to keep our bowstrings dry in our shirts, too, what wiâ€™ the rain coming down and dripping down our necks through the fern.

â€œBut come the dawn,â€ he went on cheerfully, â€œand we stood on the signal and let fly. I will say â€™twas a bonny sight, our arrows hailing down from the hills on the poor sods camped there by the river. Aye, your faither fought there, too, a Sheaumais,â€ he added, pointing the stem of his pipe at Jamie. â€œHe was one oâ€™ those by the river.â€ A spasm of silent laughter shook him.

â€œNo love lost, then,â€ Jamie replied, very dryly. â€œBetween you and the Frasers.â€

Old Arch shook his head, not at all discomposed.

â€œNone,â€ he said. He turned his attention back to me, his manner sobering a little.

â€œSo when the Frasers would capture a Grant alone on their land, it was their habit to give him a choice. He could lose his right eye, or the twa fingers of his right hand. Either way, he wouldna draw a bow again against them.â€

He rubbed the maimed hand slowly to and fro against his thigh, stretching it out, as though his phantom fingers reached and yearned for the touch of singing sinew. Then he shook his head, as though dismissing the vision, and curled his hand into a fist. He turned to me.

â€œYe werena intending to take Christieâ€™s fingers straight off, were ye, Mrs. Fraser?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said, startled. â€œOf course not. He doesnâ€™t think . . . ?â€

Arch shrugged, bushy white brows raised toward his receding hairline.

â€œI couldna say for sure, but he seemed verra much disturbed at the thought of being cut.â€

â€œHmm,â€ I said. Iâ€™d have to speak to Tom Christie.

Jamie had stood up to take his leave, and I followed suit automatically, shaking out my skirts and trying to shake out of my head the mental image of a young manâ€™s hand, pinned to the ground, and an ax chunking down.

â€œNo Frasers at Glenhelm, ye said?â€ Jamie asked thoughtfully, looking down at Mr. Bug. â€œLeslie, the nephewâ€”he would have been Bobby Fraserâ€™s heir, would he?â€

â€œAye, he would.â€ Mr. Bugâ€™s pipe had gone out. He turned it over and knocked the dottle neatly out against the edge of the porch.

â€œBoth killed together, were they? I mind my father telling of it, once. Found in a stream, their heads caved in, he said.â€

Arch Bug blinked up at him, eyelids lowered, lizardlike, against the sunâ€™s glare.

â€œWeel, ye see, a Sheaumais,â€ he said, â€œa bowâ€™s like a good-wife, aye? Knows her master, and answers his touch. An ax, thoughâ€”â€ He shook his head. â€œAn ax is a whore. Any man can use oneâ€”and it works as well in either hand.â€

He blew through the stem of the pipe to clear it of ash, wiped the bowl with his handkerchief, and tucked it carefully awayâ€”left-handed. He grinned at us, the remnants of his teeth sharp-edged and yellowed with tobacco.

â€œGo with God, Seaumais mac Brian.â€



LATER IN THE WEEK, I went to the Christiesâ€™ cabin, to take the stitches out of Tomâ€™s left hand and explain to him about the ether. His son, Allan, was in the yard, sharpening a knife on a foot-treadled grindstone. He smiled and nodded to me, but didnâ€™t speak, unable to be heard above the rasping whine of the grindstone.

Perhaps it was that sound, I thought, a moment later, that had aroused Tom Christieâ€™s apprehensions.

â€œI have decided that I shall leave my other hand as it is,â€ he said stiffly, as I clipped the last stitch and pulled it free.

I set down my tweezers and stared at him.

â€œWhy?â€

A dull red rose in his cheeks, and he stood up, lifting his chin and looking over my shoulder, so as not to meet my eye.

â€œI have prayed about it, and I have come to the conclusion that if this infirmity be Godâ€™s will, then it would be wrong to seek to change it.â€

I suppressed the strong urge to say â€œStuff and nonsense!â€, but with great difficulty.

â€œSit down,â€ I said, taking a deep breath. â€œAnd tell me, if you would, just why you think God wants you to go about with a twisted hand?â€

He did glance at me then, surprised and flustered.

â€œWhy . . . it is not my place to question the Lordâ€™s ways!â€

â€œOh, isnâ€™t it?â€ I said mildly. â€œI rather thought thatâ€™s what you were doing last Sunday. Or wasnâ€™t it you I heard, inquiring as to what the Lord thought He was about, letting all these Catholics flourish like the green bay tree?â€

The dull red color darkened substantially.

â€œI am sure you have misunderstood me, Mistress Fraser.â€ He straightened himself still further, so that he was nearly leaning over backward. â€œThe fact remains that I shall not require your assistance.â€

â€œIs it because Iâ€™m a Catholic?â€ I asked, settling back on the stool and folding my hands on my knee. â€œYou think perhaps Iâ€™ll take advantage of you, and baptize you into the church of Rome when youâ€™re off your guard?â€

â€œI have been suitably christened!â€ he snapped. â€œAnd I will thank you to keep your Popish notions to yourself.â€

â€œI have an arrangement with the Pope,â€ I said, giving him stare for stare. â€œI issue no bulls on points of doctrine, and he doesnâ€™t do surgery. Now, about your handâ€”â€

â€œThe Lordâ€™s willâ€”â€ he began stubbornly.

â€œWas it the Lordâ€™s will that your cow should fall into the gorge and break her leg last month?â€ I interrupted him. â€œBecause if it was, then you presumably ought to have left her there to die, rather than fetching my husband to help pull her out, and then allowing me to set her leg. How is she, by the way?â€

I could see the cow in question through the window, peacefully grazing at the edge of the yard, and evidently untroubled either by her nursing calf, or by the binding I had applied to support her cracked cannon bone.

â€œShe is well, I thank you.â€ He was beginning to sound a little strangled, though his shirt was loose at the collar. â€œThat isâ€”â€

â€œWell, then,â€ I said. â€œDo you think the Lord regards you as less deserving of medical help than your cow? It seems unlikely to me, what with Him regarding sparrows and all that.â€

Heâ€™d gone a sort of dusky purple round the jowls by this point, and clutched the defective hand with the sound one, as though to keep it safe from me.

â€œI see that you have heard something of the Bible,â€ he began, very pompous.

â€œActually, Iâ€™ve read it for myself,â€ I said. â€œI read quite well, you know.â€

He brushed this remark aside, a dim light of triumph gleaming in his eye.

â€œIndeed. Then I am sure you will have read the Letter of St. Paul to Timothy, in which he says, Let a woman be silentâ€”â€

I had, in fact, encountered St. Paul and his opinions before, and had a few of my own.

â€œI expect St. Paul ran into a woman who could outargue him, too,â€ I said, not without sympathy. â€œEasier to try to put a stopper on the entire sex than to win his point fairly. I should have expected better of you, though, Mr. Christie.â€

â€œBut thatâ€™s blasphemy!â€ he gasped, clearly shocked.

â€œIt is not,â€ I countered, â€œunless youâ€™re saying that St. Paul is actually Godâ€”and if you are, then I rather think thatâ€™s blasphemy. But letâ€™s not quibble,â€ I said, seeing his eyes begin to bulge. â€œLet me . . .â€ I rose from my stool and took a step forward, bringing me within touching distance of him. He backed up so hastily that he bumped into the table and knocked it askew, sending Malvaâ€™s workbasket, a pottery jug of milk, and a pewter plate cascading to the floor with a crash.

I bent swiftly and grabbed the workbasket, in time to prevent it being soaked by the flood of milk. Mr. Christie had as swiftly seized a rag from the hearth, and bent to mop up the milk. We narrowly missed bumping heads, but did collide, and I lost my balance, falling heavily against him. He caught hold of my arms by reflex, dropping the rag, then hastily let go and recoiled, leaving me swaying on my knees.

He was on his knees, as well, breathing heavily, but now a safe distance away.

â€œThe truth of it is,â€ I said severely, pointing a finger at him, â€œyouâ€™re afraid.â€

â€œI am not!â€

â€œYes, you are.â€ I got to my feet, replaced the workbasket on the table, and shoved the rag delicately over the puddle of milk with my foot. â€œYouâ€™re afraid that Iâ€™ll hurt youâ€”but I wonâ€™t,â€ I assured him. â€œI have a medicine called ether; it will make you go to sleep, and you wonâ€™t feel anything.â€

He blinked at that.

â€œAnd perhaps youâ€™re afraid that youâ€™ll lose a few fingers, or what use of your hand you have.â€

He was still kneeling on the hearth, staring up at me.

â€œI canâ€™t absolutely guarantee that you wonâ€™t,â€ I said. â€œI donâ€™t think that will happenâ€”but man proposes, and God disposes, doesnâ€™t He?â€

He nodded, very slowly, but didnâ€™t say anything. I took a deep breath, for the moment out of argument.

â€œI think I can mend your hand,â€ I said. â€œI canâ€™t guarantee it. Sometimes things happen. Infections, accidentsâ€”something unexpected. But . . .â€

I reached out a hand to him, motioning toward the crippled member. Moving like a hypnotized bird trapped in a serpentâ€™s gaze, he extended his arm and let me take it. I grasped his wrist and pulled him to his feet; he rose easily and stood before me, letting me hold his hand.

I took it in both of mine and pressed the gnarled fingers back, rubbing my thumb gently over the thickened palmar aponeurosis that was trapping the tendons. I could feel it clearly, could see in my mind exactly how to approach the problem, where to press with the scalpel, how the calloused skin would part. The length and depth of the Z-shaped incision that would free his hand and make it useful once more.

â€œIâ€™ve done it before,â€ I said softly, pressing to feel the submerged bones. â€œI can do it again, God willing. If youâ€™ll let me?â€

He was only a couple of inches taller than I; I held his eyes, as well as his hand. They were a clear, sharp gray, and searched my face with something between fear and suspicionâ€”but with something else at the back of them. I became quite suddenly aware of his breathing, slow and steady, and felt the warmth of his breath on my cheek.

â€œAll right,â€ he said at last, hoarsely. He pulled his hand away from mine, not abruptly, but almost with reluctance, and stood cradling it in his sound one. â€œWhen?â€

â€œTomorrow,â€ I said, â€œif the weather is good. Iâ€™ll need good light,â€ I explained, seeing the startled look in his eyes. â€œCome in the morning, but donâ€™t eat breakfast.â€

I picked up my kit, bobbed an awkward curtsy to him, and left, feeling rather queer.

Allan Christie waved cheerfully to me as I left, and went on with his grinding.



â€œDO YOU THINK heâ€™ll come?â€ Breakfast had been eaten, and no sign yet of Thomas Christie. After a night of broken sleep, in which I dreamed repeatedly of ether masks and surgical disasters, I wasnâ€™t sure whether I wanted him to come or not.

â€œAye, heâ€™ll come.â€ Jamie was reading the North Carolina Gazette, four months out of date, while munching the last of Mrs. Bugâ€™s cinnamon toast. â€œLook, theyâ€™ve printed a letter from the Governor to Lord Dartmouth, saying what an unruly lot of seditious, conniving, thieving bastards we all are, and asking General Gage to send him cannon to threaten us back into good behavior. I wonder if MacDonald knows thatâ€™s public knowledge?â€

â€œDid they really?â€ I said absently. I rose, and picked up the ether mask I had been staring at all through breakfast. â€œWell, if he does come, I suppose Iâ€™d best be ready.â€

I had the ether mask Bree had made for me and the dropping bottle laid out ready in my surgery, next to the array of instruments I would need for the surgery itself. Unsure, I picked up the bottle, uncorked it, and waved a hand across the neck, wafting fumes toward my nose. The result was a reassuring wave of dizziness that blurred my vision for a moment. When it cleared, I recorked the bottle and set it down, feeling somewhat more confident.

Just in time. I heard voices at the back of the house, and footsteps in the hall.

I turned expectantly, to see Mr. Christie glowering at me from the doorway, his hand curled protectively into his chest.

â€œI have changed my mind.â€ Christie lowered his brows still further, to emphasize his position. â€œI have considered the matter, and prayed upon it, and I shall not allow ye to employ your foul potions upon me.â€

â€œYou stupid man,â€ I said, thoroughly put out. I stood up and glowered back. â€œWhat is the matter with you?â€

He looked taken aback, as though a snake in the grass at his feet had dared to address him.

â€œThere is nothing whatever the matter with me,â€ he said, quite gruff. He lifted his chin aggressively, bristling his short beard at me. â€œWhat is the matter with you, madam?â€

â€œAnd I thought it was only Highlanders who were stubborn as rocks!â€

He looked quite insulted at this comparison, but before he could take further issue with me, Jamie poked his head into the surgery, drawn by the sounds of altercation.

â€œIs there some difficulty?â€ he inquired politely.

â€œYes! He refusesâ€”â€

â€œThere is. She insistsâ€”â€

The words collided, and we both broke off, glaring at each other. Jamie glanced from me to Mr. Christie, then at the apparatus on the table. He cast his eyes up to heaven, as though imploring guidance, then rubbed a finger thoughtfully beneath his nose.

â€œAye,â€ he said. â€œWell. Dâ€™ye want your hand mended, Tom?â€

Christie went on looking mulish, cradling the crippled hand protectively against his chest. After a moment, though, he nodded slowly.

â€œAye,â€ he said. He gave me a deeply suspicious look. â€œBut I shall not be having any of this Popish nonsense about it!â€

â€œPopish?â€ Jamie and I spoke at the same time, Jamie sounding merely puzzled, myself deeply exasperated.

â€œAye, and ye need not be thinking ye can cod me into it, either, Fraser!â€

Jamie shot me an â€œI told ye so, Sassenachâ€ sort of look, but squared himself to give it a try.

â€œWell, ye always were an awkward wee bugger, Tom,â€ he said mildly. â€œYe must please yourself about it, to be sureâ€”but I can tell ye from experience that it does hurt a great deal.â€

I thought Christie paled a little.

â€œTom. Look.â€ Jamie nodded at the tray of instruments: two scalpels, a probe, scissors, forceps, and two suture needles, already threaded with gut and floating in a jar of alcohol. They gleamed dully in the sunlight. â€œShe means to cut into your hand, aye?â€

â€œI know that,â€ Christie snapped, though his eyes slid away from the sinister assemblage of sharp edges.

â€œAye, ye do. But yeâ€™ve not the slightest notion what itâ€™s like. I have. See here?â€ He held up his right hand, the back of it toward Christie, and waggled it. In that position, with the morning sun full on it, the thin white scars that laced his fingers were stark against the deep bronze skin.

â€œThat bloody hurt,â€ he assured Christie. â€œYe dinna want to do something like that, and thereâ€™s a choice about itâ€”which there is.â€

Christie barely glanced at the hand. Of course, I thought, he would be familiar with the look of it; heâ€™d lived with Jamie for three years.

â€œI have made my choice,â€ Christie said with dignity. He sat down in the chair and laid his hand palm-up on the napkin. All the color had leached out of his face, and his free hand was clenched so hard that it trembled.

Jamie looked at him under heavy brows for a moment, then sighed.

â€œAye. Wait a moment, then.â€

Obviously, there was no further point in argument, and I didnâ€™t bother trying. I took down the bottle of medicinal whisky I kept on the shelf and poured a healthy tot into a cup.

â€œTake a little wine for thy stomachâ€™s sake,â€ I said, thrusting it firmly into his upturned hand. â€œOur mutual acquaintance, St. Paul. If itâ€™s all right to drink for the sake of a stomach, surely to goodness you can take a drop for the sake of a hand.â€

His mouth, grimly compressed in anticipation, opened in surprise. He glanced from the cup to me, then back. He swallowed, nodded, and raised the cup to his lips.

Before he had finished, though, Jamie came back, holding a small, battered green book, which he thrust unceremoniously into Christieâ€™s hand.

Christie looked surprised, but held the book out, squinting to see what it was. HOLY BIBLE was printed on the warped cover, King James Version.

â€œYeâ€™ll take help where ye can, I suppose?â€ Jamie said a little gruffly.

Christie looked at him sharply, then nodded, a very faint smile passing through his beard like a shadow.

â€œI thank you, sir,â€ he said. He took his spectacles out of his coat and put them on, then opened the little book with great care and began to thumb through it, evidently looking for a suitable inspiration for undergoing surgery without anesthetic.

I gave Jamie a long look, to which he responded with the faintest of shrugs. It wasnâ€™t merely a Bible. It was the Bible that had once belonged to Alexander MacGregor.

Jamie had come by it as a very young man, when he was imprisoned in Fort William by Captain Jonathan Randall. Flogged once, and awaiting another, frightened and in pain, he had been left in solitary confinement with no company save his thoughtsâ€”and this Bible, given to him by the garrisonâ€™s surgeon for what comfort it might offer.

Alex MacGregor had been another young Scottish prisonerâ€”one who had died by his own hand, rather than suffer the further attentions of Captain Randall. His name was written inside the book, in a tidy, rather sprawling hand. The little Bible was no stranger to fear and suffering, and if it wasnâ€™t ether, I hoped it might still possess its own power of anodyne.

Christie had found something that suited him. He cleared his throat, straightened himself in the chair, and laid his hand on the towel, palm up, in such a forthright manner that I wondered whether he had settled on the passage in which the Maccabees willingly present their hands and tongues for amputation at the hands of the heathen king.

A peek over his shoulder indicated that he was somewhere in the Psalms, though.

â€œAt your convenience, then, Mistress Fraser,â€ Christie said politely.

If he wasnâ€™t to be unconscious, I needed a bit of extra preparation. Manly fortitude was all very well, and so was Biblical inspirationâ€”but there are relatively few people capable of sitting motionless while having their hand sliced into, and I didnâ€™t think Thomas Christie was one of them.

I had a plentiful supply of linen strips for bandaging. I rolled back his sleeve, then used a few of the strips to bind his forearm tightly to the little table, with an additional band holding back the clawed fingers from the site of operation.

Though Christie seemed rather shocked at the notion of drinking liquor while reading the Bible, Jamieâ€”and, just possibly, the sight of the waiting scalpelsâ€”had convinced him that circumstances justified it. He had consumed a couple of ounces by the time I had him properly secured and his palm thoroughly swabbed with raw alcohol, and was looking significantly more relaxed than he had upon entering the room.

This sense of relaxation disappeared abruptly when I made the first incision.

His breath rushed out in a high-pitched gasp and he arched upward out of the chair, jerking the table across the floor with a screech. I grabbed his wrist in time to prevent his ripping the bandages away, and Jamie seized him by both shoulders, pressing him back into the chair.

â€œNow then, now then,â€ Jamie said, squeezing firmly. â€œYouâ€™ll do, Tom. Aye, youâ€™ll do.â€

Sweat had popped out all over Christieâ€™s face, and his eyes were huge behind the lenses of his spectacles. He gulped, swallowed, took a quick look at his hand, which was welling blood, then looked away fast, white as a sheet.

â€œIf youâ€™re going to vomit, Mr. Christie, do it there, will you?â€ I said, shoving an empty bucket toward him with one foot. I still had one hand on his wrist, the other pressing a wad of sterilized lint hard onto the incision.

Jamie was still talking to him like one settling a panicked horse. Christie was rigid, but breathing hard, and trembling in every limb, including the one I meant to be working on.

â€œShall I stop?â€ I asked Jamie, giving Christie a quick appraisal. I could feel his pulse hammering in the wrist I grasped. He wasnâ€™t in shockâ€”quiteâ€”but plainly wasnâ€™t feeling at all well.

Jamie shook his head, eyes on Christieâ€™s face.

â€œNo. Shame to waste that much whisky, aye? And heâ€™ll not want to go through the waiting again. Here, Tom, have another dram; it will do ye good.â€ He pressed the cup to Christieâ€™s lips, and Christie gulped it without hesitation.

Jamie had let go of Christieâ€™s shoulders as he settled; now he took hold of Christieâ€™s forearm with one hand, gripping firmly. With the other, he picked up the Bible, which had fallen to the floor, and thumbed it open.

â€œThe right hand of the Lord is exalted,â€ he read, squinting over Christieâ€™s shoulder at the book. â€œThe right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. Well, thatâ€™s appropriate, no?â€ He glanced down at Christie, who had subsided, his free hand clenched in a fist against his belly.

â€œGo on,â€ Christie said, voice hoarse.

â€œI shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord,â€ Jamie went on, his voice low but firm. â€œThe Lord hath chastened me sore, but he hath not given me over unto death.â€

Christie seemed to find this heartening; his breathing slowed a little.

I couldnâ€™t spare time to look at him, and his arm under Jamieâ€™s grasp was hard as wood. Still, he was beginning to murmur along with Jamie, catching every few words.

â€œOpen to me the gates of righteousness. . . I will praise thee, for thou hast heard me. . . .â€

I had the aponeurosis laid bare, and could clearly see the thickening. A flick of the scalpel freed the edge of it; then a ruthless slice, cutting hard down through the fibrous band of tissue . . . the scalpel struck bone, and Christie gasped.

â€œGod is the Lord which has showed us light; bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. . . .â€ I could hear a tinge of amusement in Jamieâ€™s voice as he read that bit, and felt the shift of his body as he glanced toward me.

It did look rather as though I had been sacrificing something; hands donâ€™t bleed as profusely as head wounds, but there are plenty of small vessels in the palm, and I was hastily blotting away the blood with one hand as I worked with the other; discarded wads of bloodstained lint littered the table and the floor around me.

Jamie was flipping to and fro, picking out random bits of Scripture, but Christie was with him now, speaking the words along with him. I stole a hasty glance at him; his color was still bad, and his pulse thundering, but the breathing was better. He was clearly speaking from memory; the lenses of his spectacles were fogged.

I had the hindering tissue fully exposed now, and was trimming away the tiny fibers from the surface of the tendon. The clawed fingers twitched, and the exposed tendons moved suddenly, silver as darting fish. I grabbed the feebly wiggling fingers and squeezed them fiercely.

â€œYou mustnâ€™t move,â€ I said. â€œI need both hands; I canâ€™t hold yours.â€

I couldnâ€™t look up, but felt him nod, and released his fingers. With the tendons gleaming softly in their beds, I removed the last bits of the aponeurosis, sprayed the wound with a mixture of alcohol and distilled water for disinfection, and set about closing the incisions.

The menâ€™s voices were no more than whispers, a low susurrus to which I had paid no attention, engrossed as I was. As I relaxed my attention and began to suture the wound, though, I became aware of them again.

â€œThe Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. . . .â€

I looked up, wiping perspiration from my forehead with my sleeve, and saw that Thomas Christie now held the small Bible, closed and pressed against his body with his free arm. His chin jammed hard into his chest, his eyes tight closed and face contorted with pain.

Jamie still held the bound arm tight, but had his other hand on Christieâ€™s shoulder, his own head bent near Christieâ€™s; his eyes, too, were closed, as he whispered the words.

â€œYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. . . .â€

I knotted the last suture, clipped the thread, and in the same movement, cut through the linen bindings with my scissors, and let go the breath Iâ€™d been holding. The menâ€™s voices stopped abruptly.

I lifted the hand, wrapped a fresh dressing tightly around it, and pressed the clawed fingers gently back, straightening them.

Christieâ€™s eyes opened, slowly. His pupils were huge and dark behind his lenses, as he blinked at his hand. I smiled at him, and patted it.

â€œSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,â€ I said softly. â€œAnd I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.â€

TOUCH ME NOT




CHRISTIEâ€™S PULSE WAS a little rapid, but strong. I set down the wrist I had been holding, and put the back of my hand against his forehead.

â€œYouâ€™re a bit feverish,â€ I said. â€œHere, swallow this.â€ I put a hand behind his back to help him sit up in bed, which alarmed him. He sat up in a flurry of bedclothes, drawing in his breath sharply as he jostled the injured hand.

I tactfully affected not to notice his discomposure, which I put down to the fact that he was clad in his shirt and I in my nightclothes. These were modest enough, to be sure, with a light shawl covering my linen night rail, but I was reasonably sure that he hadnâ€™t been anywhere near a woman in dishabille since his wife diedâ€”if then.

I murmured something meaningless, holding the cup of comfrey tea for him as he drank, and then settled his pillows in comfortable but impersonal fashion.

Rather than send him back to his own cabin, I had insisted that he stay the night, so I could keep an eye on him in case of postoperative infection. Intransigent as he was by nature, I didnâ€™t by any means trust him to follow instructions and not to be slopping hogs, cutting wood, or wiping his backside with the wounded hand. I wasnâ€™t letting him out of sight until the incision had begun to granulateâ€”which it should do by the next day, if all went well.

Still shaky from the shock of surgery, he had made no demur, and Mrs. Bug and I had put him to bed in the Wemyssesâ€™ room, Mr. Wemyss and Lizzie having gone to the McGillivraysâ€™.

I had no laudanum, but had slipped Christie a strong infusion of valerian and St. Johnâ€™s wort, and he had slept most of the afternoon. He had declined any supper, but Mrs. Bug, who approved of Mr. Christie, had been plying him through the evening with toddies, syllabubs, and other nourishing elixirsâ€”all containing a high percentage of alcohol. Consequently, he seemed rather dazed, as well as flushed, and made no protest as I picked up the bandaged hand and brought the candle close to examine it.

The hand was swollen, which was to be expected, but not excessively so. Still, the bandage was tight, and cutting uncomfortably into the flesh. I snipped it, and holding the honeyed dressing that covered the wound carefully in place, lifted the hand and sniffed at it.

I could smell honey, blood, herbs, and the faintly metallic scent of fresh-severed fleshâ€”but no sweet whiff of pus. Good. I pressed carefully near the dressing, watching for signs of sharp pain or streaks of vivid red in the skin, but bar a reasonable tenderness, I saw only a small degree of inflammation.

Still, he was feverish; it would bear watching. I took a fresh length of bandage and wound it carefully over the dressing, finishing with a neat bow at the back of the hand.

â€œWhy do you never wear a proper kerch or cap?â€ he blurted.

â€œWhat?â€ I looked up in surprise, having temporarily forgotten the man attached to the hand. I put my free hand to my head. â€œWhy should I?â€

I sometimes plaited my hair before bed, but hadnâ€™t tonight. I had brushed it, though, and it floated loose around my shoulders, smelling pleasantly of the hyssop and nettle-flower infusion I combed through it to keep lice at bay.

â€œWhy?â€ His voice rose a little. â€œEvery woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.â€

â€œOh, are we back to Paul again?â€ I murmured, returning my attention to his hand. â€œDoes it not occur to you that that man had rather a bee in his bonnet when it came to women? Besides, Iâ€™m not praying at the moment, and I want to see how this does overnight, before I risk any prophesying about it. So far, though, it seemsâ€”â€

â€œYour hair.â€ I looked up to see him staring at me, mouth curved downward in disapproval. â€œItâ€™s . . .â€ He made a vague movement round his own clipped poll. â€œItâ€™s . . .â€

I raised my brows at him.

â€œThereâ€™s a great deal of it,â€ he ended, rather feebly.

I eyed him for a moment, then put down his hand and reached for the little green Bible, which was sitting on the table.

â€œCorinthians, was it? Hmm, oh, yes, here we are.â€ I straightened my back and read the verse: â€œDoth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.â€ I closed the book with a snap and set it down.

â€œWould you care to step across the landing and explain to my husband how shameful his hair is?â€ I asked politely. Jamie had gone to bed; a faint, rhythmic snoring was audible from our room. â€œOr do you expect he knows that already?â€

Christie was already flushed from drink and fever; at this, an ugly dark red washed him from chest to hairline. His mouth moved, opening and closing soundlessly. I didnâ€™t wait for him to decide on something to say, but merely turned my attention back to his hand.

â€œNow,â€ I said firmly, â€œyou must do exercise regularly, to make sure that the muscles donâ€™t contract as they heal. It will be painful at first, but you must do it. Let me show you.â€

I took hold of his ring finger, just below the first joint, and keeping the finger itself straight, bent the top joint a little inward.

â€œDo you see? Here, you do it. Take hold with your other hand, and then try to bend just that one joint. Yes, thatâ€™s it. Do you feel the pull, down through the palm of your hand? Thatâ€™s just whatâ€™s wanted. Now, do it with the little finger . . . yes. Yes, thatâ€™s very good!â€

I looked up and smiled at him. The flush had faded a little, but he still looked thoroughly nonplussed. He didnâ€™t smile back at me, but glanced hastily away, down at his hand.

â€œRight. Now, put your hand flat on the tableâ€”yes, thatâ€™s the wayâ€”and try to raise your fourth finger and little finger by themselves. Yes, I know it isnâ€™t easy. Keep trying, though. Are you hungry, Mr. Christie?â€

His stomach had given a loud growl, startling him as much as me.

â€œI suppose I might eat,â€ he mumbled ungraciously, scowling at his uncooperative hand.

â€œIâ€™ll fetch you something. Keep trying those exercises for a bit, why donâ€™t you?â€

The house was quiet, settled for the night. Warm as it was, the shutters had been left open, and enough moonlight streamed through the windows that I didnâ€™t need to light a candle. A shadow detached itself from the darkness in my surgery, and followed me down the hallway to the kitchenâ€”Adso, leaving off his nocturnal hunt for mice, in hopes of easier prey.

â€œHallo, cat,â€ I said, as he slithered past my ankles into the pantry. â€œIf you think youâ€™re having any of the ham, think again. I might go as far as a saucer of milk, though.â€ The milk jug was white earthenware with a blue band round it, a squat, pale shape floating in the darkness. I poured out a saucer and put it down on the floor for Adso, then set about assembling a light supperâ€”aware that Scottish expectations of a light meal involved sufficient food to founder a horse.

â€œHam, cold fried potatoes, cold fried mush, bread and butter,â€ I chanted under my breath, shoveling it all onto a large wooden tray. â€œRabbit dumpling, tomato pickle, a bit of raisin pie for pudding . . . what else?â€ I glanced down toward the soft lapping noises coming from the shadows at my feet. â€œIâ€™d give him milk, too, but he wouldnâ€™t drink it. Well, we might as well keep on as weâ€™ve started, I suppose; it will help him to sleep.â€ I reached for the whisky decanter and put that on the tray, as well.

A faint scent of ether floated in the dark air of the hallway as I made my way back toward the stairs. I sniffed suspiciouslyâ€”had Adso tipped over the bottle? No, it wasnâ€™t strong enough for that, I decided, just a few wayward molecules seeping around the cork.

I was simultaneously relieved and regretful that Mr. Christie had refused to let me use the ether. Relieved, because there was no telling how it might have workedâ€”or not. Regretful, because I would have liked very much to add the gift of unconsciousness to my arsenal of skillsâ€”a precious gift to bestow on future patients, and one I should very much have liked to give Mr. Christie.

Beyond the fact that the surgery had hurt him badly, it was very much more difficult to operate on a conscious person. The muscles were tensed, adrenaline was flooding through the system, heart rate was vastly speeded up, causing blood to spurt rather than flow. . . . For the dozenth time since the morning, I envisioned exactly what I had done, asking myself whether I might have done better.

To my surprise, Christie was still doing the exercises; his face was sheened with sweat and his mouth set grimly, but he was still doggedly bending the joints.

â€œThatâ€™s very good,â€ I said. â€œDo stop now, though. I donâ€™t want you to start bleeding again.â€ I picked up the napkin automatically and blotted the sweat from his temples.

â€œIs there someone else in the house?â€ he asked, irritably jerking his head away from my ministrations. â€œI heard you speaking to someone downstairs.â€

â€œOh,â€ I said, rather embarrassed. â€œNo, just the cat.â€ Prompted by this introduction, Adso, who had followed me upstairs, leapt onto the bed and stood kneading the covers with his paws, big green eyes fixed on the plate of ham.

Christie turned a gaze of deep suspicion from the cat to me.

â€œNo, he is not my familiar,â€ I said tartly, scooping up Adso and dumping him unceremoniously on the floor. â€œHeâ€™s a cat. Talking to him is slightly less ridiculous than talking to myself, thatâ€™s all.â€

An expression of surprise flitted across Christieâ€™s faceâ€”perhaps surprise that I had read his mind, or simple surprise at my idiocyâ€”but the creases of suspicion round his eyes relaxed.

I cut up his food with brisk efficiency, but he insisted upon feeding himself. He ate clumsily with his left hand, eyes on his plate and brows knotted in concentration.

When he had finished, he drank off a cup of whisky as though it were water, set down the empty cup, and looked at me.

â€œMistress Fraser,â€ he said, speaking very precisely, â€œI am an educated man. I do not think ye are a witch.â€

â€œOh, you donâ€™t?â€ I said, rather amused. â€œSo you donâ€™t believe in witches? But there are witches mentioned in the Bible, you know.â€

He stifled a belch with his fist and regarded me fishily.

â€œI did not say I do not believe in witches. I do. I said ye arenâ€™t one. Aye?â€

â€œIâ€™m very much obliged to hear it,â€ I said, trying not to smile. He was quite drunk; though his speech was even more precise than usual, his accent had begun to slip. Normally, he suppressed the inflections of his native Edinburgh as much as possible, but it was growing broader by the moment.

â€œA bit more?â€ I didnâ€™t wait for an answer, but poured a solid tot of whisky into his empty cup. The shutters were open and the room was cool, but sweat still gleamed in the creases of his neck. He was clearly in pain, and wasnâ€™t likely to sleep again without help.

He sipped it this time, watching me over the rim of the cup as I tidied up the supper leavings. In spite of whisky and a full stomach, he was increasingly restive, shifting his legs beneath the quilt and twitching his shoulders. I thought he needed the chamber pot, and was debating whether I ought to offer to help him with it, or simply leave promptly so he could manage by himself. The latter, I thought.

I was mistaken, though. Before I could excuse myself, he set down his cup on the table and sat up straight in bed.

â€œMistress Fraser,â€ he said, fixing me with a beady eye. â€œI wish to apologize to ye.â€

â€œWhat for?â€ I said, startled.

His lips pressed tight.

â€œFor . . . my behavior this morning.â€

â€œOh. Well . . . thatâ€™s quite all right. I can see how the idea of being put to sleep must seem . . . quite peculiar to you.â€

â€œI dinna mean that.â€ He glanced up sharply, then down again. â€œI meant . . . that I . . . could not keep myself still.â€

I saw the deepening flush rise up his cheeks again, and had a sudden pang of surprised sympathy. He was truly embarrassed.

I set down the tray and sat down slowly on the stool beside him, wondering what I could say that might assuage his feelingsâ€”and not make matters worse.

â€œBut, Mr. Christie,â€ I said. â€œI wouldnâ€™t expect anyone to hold still while having their hand taken apart. Itâ€™sâ€”itâ€™s simply not human nature!â€

He shot me a quick, fierce glance.

â€œNot even your husband?â€

I blinked, taken aback. Not so much by the words, as by the tone of bitterness. Roger had told me a bit of what Kenny Lindsay had said about Ardsmuir. It had been no secret that Christie had been envious of Jamieâ€™s leadership thenâ€”but what had that to do with this?

â€œWhat makes you say that?â€ I asked quietly. I took his injured hand, ostensibly to check the bindingsâ€”in fact, merely to give me somewhere to look other than into his eyes.

â€œItâ€™s true, aye? Your husbandâ€™s hand.â€ His beard jutted pugnaciously at me. â€œHe said yeâ€™d mended it for him. He didna wriggle and squirm when ye did it, now, did he?â€

Well, no, he hadnâ€™t. Jamie had prayed, cursed, sweated, criedâ€”and screamed, once or twice. But he hadnâ€™t moved.

Jamieâ€™s hand wasnâ€™t a matter I wanted to discuss with Thomas Christie, though.

â€œEveryoneâ€™s different,â€ I said, giving him as straight a look as I could. â€œI wouldnâ€™t expectâ€”â€

â€œYe wouldna expect any man to do as well as him. Aye, I ken that.â€ The dull red color was burning in his cheeks again, and he looked down at his bandaged hand. The fingers of his good hand were clenched in a fist.

â€œThatâ€™s not what I meant,â€ I protested. â€œNot at all! Iâ€™ve stitched wounds and set bones for a good many menâ€”almost all the Highlanders were terribly brave aboutâ€”â€ It occurred to me, that fraction of a second too late, that Christie was not a Highlander.

He made a deep growling noise in his throat.

â€œHighlanders,â€ he said, â€œhmp!â€ in a tone that made it clear he would have liked to spit on the floor, had he not been in the presence of a lady.

â€œBarbarians?â€ I said, responding to the tone. He glanced at me, and I saw his mouth twist, as he had his own moment of belated realization. He looked away, and took a deep breathâ€”I smelled the gust of whisky as he let it out.

â€œYour husband . . . is . . . certainly a gentleman. He comes of a noble family, if one tainted by treason.â€ The â€œrâ€s of â€œtreasonâ€ rolled like thunderâ€”he really was quite drunk. â€œBut he is also . . . also . . .â€ He frowned, groping for a better word, then gave it up. â€œOne of them. Surely ye ken that, and you an Englishwoman?â€

â€œOne of them,â€ I repeated, mildly amused. â€œYou mean a Highlander, or a barbarian?â€

He gave me a look somewhere between triumph and puzzlement.

â€œThe same thing, is it not?â€

I rather thought he had a point. While I had met Highlanders of wealth and education, like Colum and Dougal MacKenzieâ€”to say nothing of Jamieâ€™s grandfather, the treasonous Lord Lovat to whom Christie was referringâ€”the fact was that every single one of them had the instincts of a Viking freebooter. And to be perfectly honest, so did Jamie.

â€œAh . . . well, they, um, do tend to be rather . . .â€ I began feebly. I rubbed a finger under my nose. â€œWell, they are raised to be fighting men, I suppose. Or is that what you mean?â€

He sighed deeply, and shook his head a little, though I thought it was not in disagreement, but simply in dismay at the contemplation of Highland customs and manners.

Mr. Christie was himself well-educated, the son of a self-made Edinburgh merchant. As such, he had pretensionsâ€”painful onesâ€”to being a gentlemanâ€”but would obviously never make a proper barbarian. I could see why Highlanders both puzzled and annoyed him. What must it have been like, I wondered, for him to find himself imprisoned alongside a horde of uncouthâ€”by his standardsâ€”violent, flamboyant, Catholic barbarians, treatedâ€”or mistreatedâ€”as one of them?

He had leaned back a little on his pillow, eyes closed and mouth compressed. Without opening his eyes, he asked suddenly, â€œDâ€™ye ken that your husband bears the stripes of flogging?â€

I opened my mouth to reply tartly that I had been married to Jamie for nearly thirty yearsâ€”when I realized that the question implied something about the nature of Mr. Christieâ€™s own concept of marriage that I didnâ€™t want to consider too closely.

â€œI know,â€ I said instead, briefly, with a quick glance toward the open door. â€œWhy?â€

Christie opened his eyes, which were a little unfocused. With some effort, he brought his gaze to bear on me.

â€œYe know why?â€ he asked, slurring a little. â€œWhaâ€™ he did?â€

I felt heat rise in my cheeks, on Jamieâ€™s behalf.

â€œAt Ardsmuir,â€ Christie said before I could answer, leveling a finger at me. He poked it at the air, almost in accusation. â€œHe claimed a bit of tartan, aye? Forbidden.â€

â€œAye?â€ I said, in baffled reflex. â€œI meanâ€”did he?â€

Christie shook his head slowly back and forth, looking like a large, intoxicated owl, eyes fixed now and glaring.

â€œNot his,â€ he said. â€œA young ladâ€™s.â€

He opened his mouth to speak further, but only a soft belch emerged from it, surprising him. He closed his mouth and blinked, then tried again.

â€œIt was an act of extra . . . extraordinary . . . nobility andâ€”and courage.â€ He looked at me, and shook his head slightly. â€œImâ€”incompre . . . hensible.â€

â€œIncomprehensible? How he did it, you mean?â€ I knew how, all right; Jamie was so bloody-mindedly stubborn that he would see out any action he intended, no matter whether hell itself barred the way or what happened to him in the process. But surely Christie knew that about him.

â€œNot how.â€ Christieâ€™s head lolled a little, and he pulled it upright with an effort. â€œWhy?â€

â€œWhy?â€ I wanted to say, Because heâ€™s an effing hero, thatâ€™s why; he canâ€™t help itâ€”but that wouldnâ€™t really have been right. Besides, I didnâ€™t know why Jamie had done it; he hadnâ€™t told me, and I did wonder why not.

â€œHeâ€™d do anything to protect one of his men,â€ I said instead.

Christieâ€™s gaze was rather glassy, but still intelligent; he looked at me for a long moment, unspeaking, thoughts passing slowly behind his eyes. A floorboard in the hall creaked, and I strained my ears for Jamieâ€™s breathing. Yes, I could hear it, soft and regular; he was still asleep.

â€œDoes he think that I am one of â€˜his menâ€™?â€ Christie asked at last. His voice was low, but full of both incredulity and outrage. â€œBecause I am not, I assâ€”ashure you!â€

I began to think that last glass of whisky had been a grave mistake.

â€œNo,â€ I said with a sigh, repressing the urge to close my eyes and rub my forehead. â€œIâ€™m sure he doesnâ€™t. If you mean thatâ€â€”I nodded at the little Bibleâ€”â€œIâ€™m sure it was simple kindness. Heâ€™d do as much for any strangerâ€”you would yourself, wouldnâ€™t you?â€

He breathed heavily for a bit, glaring, but then nodded once and lay back, as though exhaustedâ€”as well he might be. All the belligerence had gone out of him as suddenly as air from a balloon, and he looked somehow smaller, and rather forlorn.

â€œI am sorry,â€ he said softly. He lifted his bandaged hand a little, and let it fall.

I wasnâ€™t sure whether he was apologizing for his remarks about Jamie, or for what he saw as his lack of bravery in the morning. I thought it wiser not to inquire, though, and stood up, smoothing down the linen night rail over my thighs.

I pulled the quilt up a bit and tugged it straight, then blew out the candle. He was no more than a dark shape against the pillows, his breathing slow and hoarse.

â€œYou did very well,â€ I whispered, and patted his shoulder. â€œGood night, Mr. Christie.â€



MY PERSONAL BARBARIAN was asleep, but woke, catlike, when I crawled into bed. He stretched out an arm and gathered me into himself with a sleepily interrogative â€œmmmm?â€

I nestled against him, tight muscles beginning to relax automatically into his warmth.

â€œMmmm.â€

â€œAh. And howâ€™s our wee Tom, then?â€ He leaned back a little and his big hands came down on my trapezius, kneading the knots from my neck and shoulders.

â€œOh. Oh. Obnoxious, prickly, censorious, and very drunk. Otherwise, fine. Oh, yes. More, pleaseâ€”up a bit, oh, yes. Oooh.â€

â€œAye, well, that sounds like Tom at his bestâ€”bar the drunkenness. If ye groan like that, Sassenach, heâ€™ll think Iâ€™m rubbing something other than your neck.â€

â€œI do not care,â€ I said, eyes closed, the better to appreciate the exquisite sensations vibrating through my spinal column. â€œIâ€™ve had quite enough of Tom Christie for the moment. Besides, heâ€™s likely passed out by now, with as much as heâ€™s had to drink.â€

Still, I tempered my vocal response, in the interests of my patientâ€™s rest.

â€œWhere did that Bible come from?â€ I asked, though the answer was obvious. Jenny must have sent it from Lallybroch; her last parcel had arrived a few days before, while I was visiting Salem.

Jamie answered the question Iâ€™d really asked, sighing so his breath stirred my hair.

â€œIt gave me a queer turn to see it, when I came to it among the books my sister sent. I couldna quite decide what to do with it, aye?â€

Little wonder if it had given him a turn.

â€œWhy did she send it, did she say?â€ My shoulders were beginning to relax, the ache between them dulling. I felt him shrug behind me.

â€œShe sent it with some other books; said she was turning out the attic and found a box of them, so decided to send them to me. But she did mention hearing that the village of Kildennie had decided to emigrate to North Carolina; theyâ€™re all MacGregors up near there, ken?â€

â€œOh, I see.â€ Jamie had once told me that his intention was one day to find the mother of Alex MacGregor, and give her his Bible, with the information that her son had been avenged. He had made inquiries after Culloden, but discovered that both of the MacGregor parents were dead. Only a sister remained alive, and she had married and left her home; no one knew quite where she was, or even whether she was still in Scotland.

â€œDo you think Jennyâ€”or Ian, ratherâ€”found the sister at last? And she lived in that village?â€

He shrugged again, and with a final squeeze of my shoulders, left off.

â€œIt may be. Ye ken Jenny; sheâ€™d leave it to me whether to search for the woman.â€

â€œAnd will you?â€ I rolled over to face him. Alex MacGregor had hanged himself, rather than live as prey to Black Jack Randall. Jack Randall was dead, had died at Culloden. But Jamieâ€™s memories of Culloden were no more than fragments, driven from him by the trauma of the battle and the fever he had suffered afterward. He had waked, wounded, with Jack Randallâ€™s body lying on top of himâ€”but had no recollection of what had happened.

And yet, I supposed, Alex MacGregor had been avengedâ€”whether or not by Jamieâ€™s hand.

He thought about that for a moment, and I felt the small stirring as he tapped the two stiff fingers of his right hand against his thigh.

â€œIâ€™ll ask,â€ he said finally. â€œHer name was Mairi.â€

â€œI see,â€ I said. â€œWell, there canâ€™t be more than, oh . . . three or four hundred women named Mairi in North Carolina.â€

That made him laugh, and we drifted off to sleep, to the accompaniment of Tom Christieâ€™s stertorous snores across the hall.



IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN minutes or hours later that I woke suddenly, listening. The room was dark, the fire cold on the hearth, and the shutters rattling faintly. I tensed a little, trying to wake enough to rise and go to my patientâ€”but then heard him, a long wheezing inspiration, followed by a rumbling snore.

It wasnâ€™t that that had wakened me, I realized. It was the sudden silence beside me. Jamie was lying stiff beside me, scarcely breathing.

I put out a hand slowly, so he would not be shocked at the touch, and rested it on his leg. He hadnâ€™t had nightmares for some months, but I recognized the signs.

â€œWhat is it?â€ I whispered.

He drew breath a little deeper than usual, and his body seemed momentarily to draw in upon itself. I didnâ€™t move, but left my hand on his leg, feeling the muscle flex microscopically beneath my fingers, a tiny intimation of flight.

He didnâ€™t flee, though. He moved his shoulders in a brief, violent twitch, then let out his breath and settled into the mattress. He didnâ€™t speak for a bit, but his weight drew me closer, like a moon pulled near to its planet. I lay quiet, my hand on him, my hip against hisâ€”flesh of his flesh.

He stared upward, into the shadows between the beams. I could see the line of his profile, and the shine of his eyes as he blinked now and then.

â€œIn the dark . . .â€ he whispered at last, â€œthere at Ardsmuir, we lay in the dark. Sometimes there was a moon, or starlight, but even then, ye couldna see anything on the floor where we lay. It was naught but blackâ€”but ye could hear.â€

Hear the breathing of the forty men in the cell, and the shuffles and shifts of their movement. Snores, coughing, the sounds of restless sleepâ€”and the small furtive sounds from those who lay awake.

â€œIt would be weeks, and we wouldna think of it.â€ His voice was coming easier now. â€œWe were always starved, cold. Worn to the bone. Ye dinna think much, then; only of how to put one foot in front of another, lift another stone. . . . Ye dinna really want to think, ken? And itâ€™s easy enough not to. For a time.â€

But every now and then, something would change. The fog of exhaustion would lift, suddenly, without warning.

â€œSometimes ye kent what it wasâ€”a story someone told, maybe, or a letter that came from someoneâ€™s wife or sister. Sometimes it came out of nowhere; no one said a thing, but yeâ€™d wake to it, in the night, like the smell of a woman lying next to ye.â€

Memory, longing . . . need. They became men touched by fireâ€”roused from dull acceptance by the sudden searing recollection of loss.

â€œEveryone would go a bit mad, for a time. There would be fights, all the time. And at night, in the dark . . .â€

At night, you would hear the sounds of desperation, stifled sobs or stealthy rustlings. Some men would, in the end, reach out to anotherâ€”sometimes to be rebuffed with shouts and blows. Sometimes not.

I wasnâ€™t sure what he was trying to tell me, nor what it had to do with Thomas Christie. Or, perhaps, Lord John Grey.

â€œDid any of them ever . . . touch you?â€ I asked tentatively.

â€œNo. None of them would ever think to touch me,â€ he said very softly. â€œI was their chief. They loved meâ€”but they wouldna think, ever, to touch me.â€

He took a deep, ragged breath.

â€œAnd did you want them to?â€ I whispered. I could feel my own pulse begin to throb in my fingertips, against his skin.

â€œI hungered for it,â€ he said so softly I could barely hear him, close as I was. â€œMore than food. More than sleepâ€”though I wished most desperately for sleep, and not only for the sake of tiredness. For when I slept, sometimes I saw ye.

â€œBut it wasna the longing for a womanâ€”though Christ knows, that was bad enough. It was onlyâ€”I wanted the touch of a hand. Only that.â€

His skin had ached with need, â€™til he felt it must grow transparent, and the raw soreness of his heart be seen in his chest.

He made a small rueful sound, not quite a laugh.

â€œYe ken those pictures of the Sacred Heartâ€”the same as we saw in Paris?â€

I knew themâ€”Renaissance paintings, and the vividness of stained glass glowing in the aisles of Notre Dame. The Man of Sorrows, his heart exposed and pierced, radiant with love.

â€œI remembered that. And I thought to myself that whoever saw that vision of Our Lord was likely a verra lonely man himself, to have understood so well.â€

I lifted my hand and laid it on the small hollow in the center of his chest, very lightly. The sheet was thrown back, and his skin was cool.

He closed his eyes, sighing, and clasped my hand, hard.

â€œThe thought of that would come to me sometimes, and I would think I kent what Jesus must feel like thereâ€”so wanting, and no one to touch Him.â€

ASHES TO ASHES




JAMIE CHECKED HIS SADDLEBAGS once more, though he had done it so often of late that the exercise was little more than custom. Each time he opened the left-hand one, he still smiled, though. Brianna had remade it for him, stitching in loops of leather that presented his pistols, hilt up, ready to be seized in an emergency, and a clever arrangement of compartments that held handy his shot pouch, powder horn, a spare knife, a coil of fishing line, a roll of twine for a snare, a hussif with pins, needles, and thread, a packet of food, a bottle of beer, and a neatly rolled clean shirt.

On the outside of the bag was a small pouch that held what Bree was pleased to call a â€œfirst-aid kit,â€ though he was unsure what it was meant to be in aid of. It contained several gauze packets of a bitter-smelling tea, a tin of salve, and several strips of her adhesive plaster, none of which seemed likely to be of use in any imaginable misadventure, but did no harm.

He removed a cake of soap she had added, along with a few more unnecessary fripperies, and carefully hid them under a bucket, lest she be offended.

Just in time, too; he heard her voice, exhorting wee Roger about the inclusion of sufficient clean stockings in his bags. By the time they came round the corner of the hay barn, he had everything securely buckled up.

â€œReady, then, a charaid?â€

â€œOh, aye.â€ Roger nodded, and slung the saddlebags he was carrying on his shoulder off onto the ground. He turned to Bree, who was carrying Jemmy, and kissed her briefly.

â€œI go with you, Daddy!â€ Jem exclaimed hopefully.

â€œNot this time, sport.â€

â€œWanna see Indians!â€

â€œLater, perhaps, when yeâ€™re bigger.â€

â€œI can talk Indian! Uncle Ian tellt me! Wanna go!â€

â€œNot this time,â€ Bree told him firmly, but he wasnâ€™t inclined to listen, and began struggling to get down. Jamie made a small rumble in his throat, and fixed him with a quelling eye.

â€œYeâ€™ve heard your parents,â€ he said. Jem glowered, and stuck out his lower lip like a shelf, but ceased his fuss.

â€œSomeday ye must tell me how ye do that,â€ Roger said, eyeing his offspring.

Jamie laughed, and leaned down to Jemmy. â€œKiss Grandda goodbye, eh?â€

Disappointment generously abandoned, Jemmy reached up and seized him round the neck. He picked the little boy up out of Briannaâ€™s arms, hugged him, and kissed him. Jem smelled of parritch, toast, and honey, a homely warm and heavy weight in his arms.

â€œBe good and mind your mother, aye? And when yeâ€™re a wee bit bigger, yeâ€™ll come, too. Come and say farewell to Clarence; ye can tell him the words Uncle Ian taught ye.â€ And God willing, theyâ€™d be words suitable for a three-year-old child. Ian had a most irresponsible sense of humor.

Or perhaps, he thought, grinning to himself, Iâ€™m only recalling some oâ€™ the things I taught Jennyâ€™s bairnsâ€”including Ianâ€”to say in French.

Heâ€™d already saddled and bridled Rogerâ€™s horse, and Clarence the pack mule was fully loaded. Brianna was checking the girth and stirrup leathers while Roger slung his saddlebagsâ€”more to keep herself busy than because of any need. Her lower lip was caught in her teeth; she was being careful not to seem worried, but was fooling no one.

Jamie took Jem up to pat the muleâ€™s nose, in order to give the lass and her man a momentâ€™s privacy. Clarence was a good sort, and suffered Jemâ€™s enthusiastic patting and mispronounced Cherokee phrases with long-suffering tolerance, but when Jem turned in his arms toward Gideon, Jamie leaned back sharply.

â€œNay, lad, ye dinna want to touch yon wicked bugger. Heâ€™ll take your hand right off.â€

Gideon twitched his ears and stamped once, impatient. The big stallion was dying to get under way and have another chance at killing him.

â€œWhy do you keep that vicious thing?â€ Brianna asked, seeing Gideonâ€™s long lip wrinkle back to show his yellow teeth in anticipation. She took Jemmy from him, stepping well away from Gideon.

â€œWhat, wee Gideon? Oh, we get on. Besides, heâ€™s half my trade goods, lass.â€

â€œReally?â€ She gave the big chestnut a suspicious glance. â€œAre you sure you wonâ€™t start a war, giving the Indians something like him?â€

â€œOh, I dinna mean to give him to them,â€ he assured her. â€œNot directly, at least.â€

Gideon was a bad-tempered, thrawn-headed reester of a horse, with a mouth like iron and a will to match. However, these unsociable qualities seemed most appealing to the Indians, as did the stallionâ€™s massive chest, long wind, and stoutly muscled frame. When Quiet Air, the sachem in one of the villages, had offered him three deerskins for the chance to breed his spotted mare to Gideon, Jamie had realized suddenly that he had something here.

â€œâ€™Twas the greatest good fortune that I never found the time to castrate him,â€ he said, slapping Gideon familiarly on the withers and dodging by reflex as the stallion whipped his head round to snap. â€œHe earns his keep, and more, standing at stud to the Indian ponies. Itâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™ve ever asked him to do that heâ€™s not balked at.â€

The lass was pink as a Christmas rose from the morning cold; she laughed at that, though, going an even deeper color.

â€œWhatâ€™s castrate?â€ Jemmy inquired.

â€œYour mother will tell ye.â€ He grinned at her, ruffled Jemmyâ€™s hair, and turned to Roger. â€œReady, lad?â€

Roger Mac nodded and stepped up into his stirrup, swinging aboard. He had a steady old bay gelding named Agrippa, who tended to grunt and wheeze, but was sound enough for all that, and good for a rider like Rogerâ€”competent enough, but with an abiding sense of inner reservation about horses.

Roger leaned down from the saddle for a last kiss from Brianna, and they were under way. Jamieâ€™d taken a privateâ€”and thoroughâ€”leave of Claire earlier.

She was in the window of their bedroom, watching out to wave to them as they rode past, her hairbrush in her hand. Her hair was standing out in a great curly swash round her head, and the early-morning sun caught in it like flames in a thornbush. It gave him a sudden queer feeling to see her thus so disordered, half-naked in her shift. A sense of strong desire, despite what heâ€™d done to her not an hour past. And something almost fear, as though he might never see her again.

Quite without thought, he glanced at his left hand, and saw the ghost of the scar at the base of his thumb, the â€œCâ€ so faded that it was scarcely visible. He had not noticed it or thought of it in years, and felt suddenly as though there was not air enough to breathe.

He waved, though, and she threw him a mocking kiss, laughing. Christ, heâ€™d marked her; he could see the dark patch of the love bite heâ€™d left on her neck, and a hot flush of embarrassment rose in his face. He dug his heels into Gideonâ€™s side, causing the stallion to give a squeal of displeasure and turn round to try to bite him in the leg.

With this distraction, they were safe away. He looked back only once, at the trailhead, to see her still there, framed by light. She lifted one hand, as though in benediction, and then the trees hid her from sight.



THE WEATHER WAS FAIR, though cold for as early in the autumn as it was; the horsesâ€™ breath steamed as they made their way down from the Ridge through the tiny settlement folk now called Cooperville, and along the Great Buffalo Trail to the north. He kept an eye on the sky; it was much too early for snow, but heavy rains were not uncommon. What clouds there were were mareâ€™s tails, though; no cause for worry.

They didnâ€™t speak much, each man alone with his thoughts. Roger Mac was easy company, for the most part. Jamie did miss Ian, though; he would have liked to talk over the situation as it stood now with Tsisqua. Ian understood the minds of Indians better than most white men, and while Jamie understood Birdâ€™s gesture of sending the hermitâ€™s bones well enoughâ€”it was meant as a proof of his continuing goodwill toward settlers, if the King should send them gunsâ€”he would have valued Ianâ€™s opinion.

And while it was necessary that he introduce Roger Mac in the villages, for the sake of future relations . . . Well, he blushed at the thought of having to explain to the man about . . .

Damn Ian. The lad had simply gone in the night, a few days past, him and his dog. Heâ€™d done it before, and would doubtless be back as suddenly as heâ€™d gone. Whatever darkness heâ€™d brought back from the north would now and then become too much for him, and he would vanish into the wood, coming back silent and withdrawn, but somewhat more at peace with himself.

Jamie understood it well enough; solitude was in its own way a balm for loneliness. And whatever memory the lad was fleeingâ€”or seekingâ€”in the wood . . .

â€œHas he ever spoken to you about them?â€ Claire had asked him, troubled. â€œHis wife? His child?â€

He had not. Ian did not speak of anything about his time among the Mohawk, and the only token he had brought back from the north was an armlet, made of blue-and-white wampum shells. Jamie had caught a glimpse of it in Ianâ€™s sporran once, but not enough to tell the pattern of it.

Blessed Michael defend you, lad, he thought silently toward Ian. And may the angels mend you.

With one thing and another, he had no real conversation with Roger Mac until theyâ€™d stopped for their noon meal. They ate the fresh stuff the women had sent, enjoying it. Enough for supper left; next day, it would be corn dodgers and anything that came across their path that could be easily caught and cooked. And one day more, and the Snowbird women would have them royally fed, as representatives of the King of England.

â€œLast time, it was ducks, stuffed wiâ€™ yams and corn,â€ he told Roger. â€œItâ€™s manners to eat as much as ye can, mind, no matter whatâ€™s served, and yeâ€™re the guest.â€

â€œGot it.â€ Roger smiled faintly, then looked down at the half-eaten sausage roll in his hand. â€œAbout that. Guests, I mean. Thereâ€™s a wee problem, I thinkâ€”with Hiram Crombie.â€

â€œHiram?â€ Jamie was surprised. â€œWhatâ€™s to do wiâ€™ Hiram?â€

Rogerâ€™s mouth twitched, unsure whether to laugh or not.

â€œWell, itâ€™s onlyâ€”ye ken everybodyâ€™s calling the bones we buried Ephraim, aye? Itâ€™s all Breeâ€™s fault, but there it is.â€

Jamie nodded, curious.

â€œWell, so. Yesterday Hiram came along to me, and said heâ€™d been studying upon the matterâ€”praying and the likeâ€”and had come to the conclusion that if it were true that some of the Indians were his wifeâ€™s kin, then it stood to reason that some of them must be saved, as well.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ Amusement began to kindle in his own breast.

â€œYes. And so, he says, he feels called upon to bring these hapless savages the word of Christ. For how else are they to hear it?â€

Jamie rubbed a knuckle over his upper lip, torn now between amusement and dismay at the thought of Hiram Crombie invading the Cherokee villages, psalmbook in hand.

â€œMmphm. Well, but . . . do ye not believeâ€”Presbyterians, I meanâ€”that itâ€™s all predestined? That some are saved, I mean, and some damned, and not a thing to be done about it? Which is why the Papists are all bound for hell in a handbasket?â€

â€œAh . . . well . . .â€ Roger hesitated, clearly not quite willing to put the matter so baldly himself. â€œMmphm. There may be some difference of opinion among Presbyterians, I imagine. But yes, thatâ€™s more or less what Hiram and his cohorts think.â€

â€œAye. Well, then, if he thinks some oâ€™ the Indians must be saved already, why must they be preached to?â€

Roger rubbed a finger between his brows.

â€œWell, dâ€™ye see, itâ€™s the same reason Presbyterians pray and go to kirk and all. Even if theyâ€™re saved, they feel they want to praise God for it, andâ€”and learn to do better, so as to live as God wishes them to. In gratitude for their salvation, see?â€

â€œI rather think Hiram Crombieâ€™s God might take a dim view of the Indian way of living,â€ Jamie said, with vivid memories of naked bodies in the dimness of ember glow, and the smell of furs.

â€œQuite,â€ Roger said, catching Claireâ€™s dry tone so exactly that Jamie laughed.

â€œAye, I see the difficulty,â€ he said, and he did, though he still found it funny. â€œSo Hiram means to go to the Cherokee villages and preach? Is that it?â€

Roger nodded, swallowing a bit of sausage.

â€œTo be more exact, he wants you to take him there. And make introduction for him. He wouldna expect ye to interpret the preaching, he says.â€

â€œHoly God.â€ He took a moment to contemplate this prospect, then shook his head decidedly. â€œNo.â€

â€œOf course not.â€ Roger pulled the cork from a bottle of beer, and offered it to him. â€œI just thought I should tell ye, so ye can decide best what to say to him when he asks.â€

â€œVerra thoughtful of ye,â€ Jamie said, and taking the bottle, drank deeply.

He lowered it, took breathâ€”and froze. He saw Roger Macâ€™s head turn sharply and knew he had caught it, too, borne on the chilly breeze.

Roger Mac turned back to him, black brows furrowed.

â€œDo ye smell something burning?â€ he said.



ROGER HEARD THEM first: a raucous caucus of cries and cackles, shrill as witches. Then a clappering of wings as they came in sight, and the birds flew up, mostly crows, but here and there a huge black raven.

â€œOh, God,â€ he said softly.

Two bodies hung from a tree beside the house. What was left of them. He could tell that it was a man and a woman, but only by their clothes. A piece of paper was pinned to the manâ€™s leg, so crumpled and stained that he saw it only because one edge lifted in the breeze.

Jamie ripped it off, unfolded it enough to read, and threw it on the ground. Death to Regulators, it read; he saw the scrawl for an instant, before the wind blew it away.

â€œWhere are the bairns?â€ Jamie asked, turning sharply to him. â€œThese folk have children. Where are they?â€

The ashes were cold, already scattering in the wind, but the smell of burning filled him, clogged his breathing, seared his throat so that words rasped like gravel, meaningless as the scrape of pebbles underfoot. Roger tried to speak, cleared his throat, and spat.

â€œHiding, maybe,â€ he rasped, and flung out an arm toward the wood.

â€œAye, maybe.â€ Jamie stood abruptly, called into the wood, and, not waiting for an answer, set off into the trees, calling again.

Roger followed, sheering off as they reached the forestâ€™s edge, going upslope behind the house, both of them shouting words of reassurance that were swallowed up at once by the forestâ€™s silence.

Roger stumbled through the trees, sweating, panting, heedless of the pain in his throat as he shouted, barely stopping long enough to hear if anyone answered. Several times he saw movement from the corner of his eye and swung toward it, only to see nothing but the ripple of wind through a patch of drying sedges, or a dangling creeper, swaying as though someone had passed that way.

He half-imagined he was seeing Jem, playing at hide-and-seek, and the vision of a darting foot, sun gleaming off a small head, lent him strength to shout again, and yet again. At last, though, he was forced to admit that children would not have run so far, and he circled back toward the cabin, still calling intermittently, in hoarse, strangled croaks.

He came back into the dooryard to find Jamie stooping for a rock, which he threw with great force at a pair of ravens that had settled in the hanging tree, edging bright-eyed back toward its burden. The ravens squawked and flapped awayâ€”but only so far as the next tree, where they sat watching.

The day was cold, but both of them were soaked with sweat, hair straggling wet on their necks. Jamie wiped his face with his sleeve, still breathing hard.

â€œH-how many . . . children?â€ Rogerâ€™s own breath was short, his throat so raw that the words were barely a whisper.

â€œThree, at least.â€ Jamie coughed, hawked, and spat. â€œThe eldest is twelve, maybe.â€ He stood for a moment, looking at the bodies. Then he crossed himself and drew his dirk to cut them down.

They had nothing to dig with; the best that could be managed was a wide scrape in the leaf mold of the forest, and a thin cairn of rocks, as much to spite the ravens as for the sake of decency.

â€œWere they Regulators?â€ Roger asked, pausing in the midst of it to wipe his face on his sleeve.

â€œAye, but . . .â€ Jamieâ€™s voice trailed away. â€œItâ€™s naught to do wiâ€™ that business.â€ He shook his head and turned away to gather more rocks.

Roger thought it was a rock at first, half-hidden in the leaves that had drifted against the scorched cabin wall. He touched it, and it moved, bringing him to his feet with a cry that would have done credit to any of the corbies.

Jamie reached him in seconds, in time to help dig the little girl out of the leaves and cinders.

â€œHush, a muirninn, hush,â€ Jamie said urgently, though in fact the child was not crying. She was maybe eight, her clothes and hair burned away and her skin so blackened and cracked that she might have been made of stone indeed, save for her eyes.

â€œOh, God, oh, God.â€ Roger kept saying it, under his breath, long after it became clear that if it was a prayer, it was long past answering.

He was cradling her against his chest, and her eyes opened halfway, regarding him with nothing like relief or curiosityâ€”only a calm fatality.

Jamie had poured water from his canteen onto a handkerchief; he fed the tip of it between her lips to wet them, and Roger saw her throat move in reflex as she sucked.

â€œYeâ€™ll be all right,â€ Roger whispered to her. â€œItâ€™s all right, a leannan.â€

â€œWho has done this, a nighean?â€ Jamie asked, just as gently. Roger saw that she understood; the question stirred the surface of her eyes like wind on a pondâ€”but then passed over, leaving them calm again. She did not speak, no matter what questions they asked, only looked at them with incurious eyes, and went on sucking dreamily at the wet cloth.

â€œAre ye baptized, a leannan?â€ Jamie asked her at last, and Roger felt a deep jolt at the question. In the shock of finding her, he had not truly taken in her condition.

â€œElle ne peut pas vivre,â€ Jamie said softly, his eyes meeting Rogerâ€™s. She cannot live.

His first instinct was a visceral denial. Of course she could live, she must. But huge patches of her skin were gone, the raw flesh crusted but still oozing. He could see the white edge of a knee bone, and literally see her heart beating, a reddish, translucent bulge that pulsed at the notch of her rib cage. She was light as a corn-dolly, and he became painfully aware that she seemed to float in his arms, like a slick of oil on water.

â€œDoes it hurt, sweetheart?â€ he asked her.

â€œMama?â€ she whispered. Then she closed her eyes and would say no more, only muttering â€œMama?â€ now and then.

He had thought at first they would take her back to the Ridge, to Claire. But it was more than a dayâ€™s ride; she wouldnâ€™t make it. Not possibly.

He swallowed, realization closing on his throat like a noose. He looked at Jamie, seeing the same sick acknowledgment in his eyes. Jamie swallowed, too.

â€œDo ye . . . know her name?â€ Roger could scarcely breathe, and forced the words. Jamie shook his head, then gathered himself, hunching his shoulders.

She had stopped sucking, but still murmured â€œMama?â€ now and then. Jamie took the handkerchief from her lips and squeezed a few drops from it onto her blackened forehead, whispering the words of baptism.

Then they looked at each other, acknowledging necessity. Jamie was pale, sweat beading on his upper lip among the bristles of red beard. He took a deep breath, steeling himself, and lifted his hands, offering.

â€œNo,â€ Roger said softly. â€œIâ€™ll do it.â€ She was his; he could no more surrender her to another than he could have torn off an arm. He reached for the handkerchief, and Jamie put it into his hand, soot-stained, still damp.

Heâ€™d never thought of such a thing, and couldnâ€™t think now. He didnâ€™t need to; without hesitation, he cradled her close and put the handkerchief over her nose and mouth, then clamped his hand tight over the cloth, feeling the small bump of her nose caught snug between his thumb and index finger.

Wind stirred in the leaves above, and a rain of gold fell on them, whispering on his skin, brushing cool past his face. She would be cold, he thought, and wished to cover her, but had no hand to spare.

His other arm was round her, hand resting on her chest; he could feel the tiny heart beneath his fingers. It jumped, beat rapidly, skipped, beat twice more . . . and stopped. It quivered for a moment; he could feel it trying to find enough strength to beat one last time, and suffered the momentary illusion that it would not only do so, but would force its way through the fragile wall of her chest and into his hand in its urge to live.

But the moment passed, as did the illusion, and a great stillness came. Near at hand, a raven called.



THEY HAD ALMOST finished the burying, when the sound of hooves and jingling harness announced visitorsâ€”a lot of visitors.

Roger, ready to decamp into the woods, glanced at his father-in-law, but Jamie shook his head, answering his unasked question.

â€œNay, theyâ€™d no come back. What for?â€ His bleak gaze took in the smoking ruin of the homestead, the trampled dooryard, and the low mounds of the graves. The little girl still lay nearby, covered with Rogerâ€™s cloak. He hadnâ€™t been able to bear putting her into the ground just yet; the knowledge of her alive was still too recent.

Jamie straightened, stretching his back. Roger saw him glance to see that his rifle was to hand, leaning against a tree trunk. Then he settled himself, leaning on the scorched board he had been using as a shovel, waiting.

The first of the riders came out of the woods, his horse snorting and tossing its head at the smell of burning. The rider pulled it skillfully round and urged it closer, leaning forward to see who they were.

â€œSo itâ€™s you, is it, Fraser?â€ Richard Brownâ€™s lined face looked grimly jovial. He glanced at the charred and steaming timbers, then round at his comrades. â€œDidnâ€™t think you made your money just by selling whisky.â€

The menâ€”Roger counted six of themâ€”shifted in their saddles, snorting with amusement.

â€œHave a bit oâ€™ respect for the dead, Brown.â€ Jamie nodded at the graves, and Brownâ€™s face hardened. He glanced sharply at Jamie, then at Roger.

â€œJust the two of you, is it? What are you doing here?â€

â€œDigging graves,â€ Roger said. His palms were blistered; he rubbed a hand slowly on the side of his breeches. â€œWhat are you doing here?â€

Brown straightened abruptly in his saddle, but it was his brother Lionel who answered.

â€œComing down from Owenawisgu,â€ he said, jerking his head at the horses. Looking, Roger saw that there were four packhorses, laden with skins, and that several of the other horses carried bulging saddlebags. â€œSmelled the fire and come to see.â€ He glanced down at the graves. â€œTige Oâ€™Brian, was it?â€

Jamie nodded.

â€œYe kent them?â€

Richard Brown shrugged.

â€œAye. Itâ€™s on the way to Owenawisgu. Iâ€™ve stopped a time or two; taken supper with them.â€ Belatedly, he removed his hat, plastering down wisps of hair over his balding crown with the flat of his hand. â€œGod rest â€™em.â€

â€œWhoâ€™s burnt â€™em out, if it wasnâ€™t you?â€ one of the younger men in the party called. The man, a Brown by his narrow shoulders and lantern jaw, grinned inappropriately, evidently thinking this a jest.

The singed bit of paper had flown with the wind; it fluttered against a rock near Rogerâ€™s foot. He picked it up and with a step forward, slapped it against Lionel Brownâ€™s saddle.

â€œKnow anything about that, do you?â€ he asked. â€œIt was pinned to Oâ€™Brianâ€™s body.â€ He sounded angry, knew it, and didnâ€™t care. His throat ached and his voice came out as a strangled rasp.

Lionel Brown glanced at the paper, brows raised, then handed it to his brother.

â€œNo. Write it yourself, did you?â€

â€œWhat?â€ He stared up at the man, blinking against the wind.

â€œIndians,â€ Lionel Brown said, nodding at the house. â€œIndians done this.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ Roger could hear the undercurrents in Jamieâ€™s voiceâ€”skepticism, wariness, and anger. â€œWhich Indians? The ones from whom ye bought the hides? Told ye about it, did they?â€

â€œDonâ€™t be a fool, Nelly.â€ Richard Brown kept his voice pitched low, but his brother flinched a little, hearing it. Brown edged his horse nearer. Jamie stood his ground, though Roger saw his hands tighten on the board.

â€œGot the whole family, did they?â€ he asked, glancing at the small body under its cloak.

â€œNo,â€ Jamie said. â€œWeâ€™ve not found the two elder children. Only the wee lassie.â€

â€œIndians,â€ Lionel Brown repeated stubbornly, from behind his brother. â€œThey took â€™em.â€

Jamie took a deep breath, and coughed from the smoke.

â€œAye,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™ll ask in the villages, then.â€

â€œWonâ€™t find â€™em,â€ Richard Brown said. He crumpled the note, tightening his fist suddenly. â€œIf Indians took them, they wonâ€™t keep them near. Theyâ€™ll sell them on, into Kentucky.â€

There was a general mutter of agreement among the men, and Roger felt the ember that had simmered in his chest all afternoon burst into fire.

â€œIndians didnâ€™t write that,â€ he snapped, jerking a thumb at the note in Brownâ€™s hand. â€œAnd if it was revenge against Oâ€™Brian for being a Regulator, they wouldnâ€™t have taken the children.â€

Brown gave him a long look, eyes narrowed. Roger felt Jamie shift his weight slightly, preparing.

â€œNo,â€ said Brown softly. â€œThey wouldnâ€™t. Thatâ€™s why Nelly figured you wrote it yourself. Say the Indians came and stole the little â€™uns, but then you come along and decide to take whatâ€™s left. So you fired the cabin, hung Oâ€™Brian and his wife, pinned that note, and here you are. How say you to that bit of reasoning, Mr. MacKenzie?â€

â€œIâ€™d ask how ye kent they were hanged, Mr. Brown.â€

Brownâ€™s face tightened, and Roger felt Jamieâ€™s hand on his arm in warning, realizing only then that his fists were clenched.

â€œThe ropes, a charaid,â€ Jamie said, his voice very calm. The words penetrated dimly, and he looked. True, the ropes they had cut from the bodies lay by the tree where they had fallen. Jamie was still talking, his voice still calm, but Roger couldnâ€™t hear the words. The wind deafened him, and just below the whine of it he heard the intermittent soft thump of a beating heart. It might have been his ownâ€”or hers.

â€œGet off that horse,â€ he said, or thought he had. The wind swept into his face, heavy with soot, and the words caught in his throat. The taste of ash was thick and sour in his mouth; he coughed and spat, eyes watering.

Vaguely, he became aware of a pain in his arm, and the world swam back into view. The younger men were staring at him, with expressions ranging from smirks to wariness. Richard Brown and his brother were both sedulously avoiding looking at him, focused instead on Jamieâ€”who was still gripping his arm.

With an effort, he shook off Jamieâ€™s hand, giving his father-in-law the slightest nod by way of reassurance that he wasnâ€™t about to go berserkâ€”though his heart still pounded, and the feel of the noose was so tight about his throat that he couldnâ€™t have spoken, even had he been able to form words.

â€œWeâ€™ll help.â€ Brown nodded at the little body on the ground, and began to swing one leg over his saddle, but Jamie stopped him with a small gesture.

â€œNay, weâ€™ll manage.â€

Brown stopped, awkwardly half-on, half-off. His lips thinned and he pulled himself back on, reined around and rode off with no word of farewell. The others followed, looking curiously back as they went.

â€œIt wasna them.â€ Jamie had taken up his rifle and held it, gazing at the wood where the last of the men had disappeared. â€œThey ken something more about it than theyâ€™ll say, though.â€

Roger nodded, wordless. He walked deliberately to the hanging tree, kicked aside the ropes, and drove his fist into the trunk, twice, three times. Stood panting, his forehead pressed against the rough bark. The pain of raw knuckles helped, a bit.

A trail of tiny ants was scurrying upward between the plates of bark, bound on some momentous business, all-absorbing. He watched them for a little, until he could swallow again. Then straightened up and went to bury her, rubbing at the bone-deep bruise on his arm.

AN EYE TO THE FUTURE




October 9, 1773

ROGER DROPPED HIS saddlebags on the ground beside the pit and peered in.

â€œWhereâ€™s Jem?â€ he said.

His mud-smeared wife looked up at him and brushed a sweat-matted lock of hair out of her face.

â€œHello to you, too,â€ she said. â€œHave a good trip?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said. â€œWhereâ€™s Jem?â€

Her brows rose at that, and she stabbed her shovel into the bottom of the pit, extending a hand for him to help her scramble out.

â€œHeâ€™s at Marsaliâ€™s. He and Germain are playing Vroom with the little cars you made themâ€”or they were when I left him there.â€

The knot of anxiety he had carried under his ribs for the last two weeks began slowly to relax. He nodded, a sudden spasm of the throat preventing him from speaking, then reached out and pulled her to him, crushing her against him in spite of her startled yelp and mud-stained clothes.

He held her hard, his own heart hammering loud in his ears, and wouldnâ€™tâ€”couldnâ€™tâ€”let go, until she wriggled out of his embrace. She kept her hands on his shoulders, but cocked her head to one side, one brow raised.

â€œYeah, I missed you, too,â€ she said. â€œWhatâ€™s wrong? What happened?â€

â€œTerrible things.â€ The burning, the little girlâ€™s deathâ€”these had become dreamlike during their travel, their horror muted to the surreal by the monotonous labor of riding, walking, the constant whine of wind and crunch of boots on gravel, sand, pine needles, mud, the engulfing blur of greens and yellows in which they lost themselves beneath an endless sky.

But now he was home, no longer adrift in the wilderness. And the memory of the girl who had left her heart in his hand was suddenly as real as she had been in the moment she died.

â€œYou come inside.â€ Brianna was peering closely at him, concerned. â€œYou need something hot, Roger.â€

â€œIâ€™m all right,â€ he said, but followed her without protest.

He sat at the table while she put the kettle on for tea, and told her everything that had happened, head in his hands, staring down at the battered tabletop, with its homely spills and burn scars.

â€œI kept thinking there must be something . . . some way. But there wasnâ€™t. Even while Iâ€”I put my hand over her faceâ€”I was sure it wasna really happening. But at the same timeâ€”â€ He sat up, then, looking into the palms of his hands. At the same time, it had been the most vivid experience of his life. He could not bear to think of it, save in the most fleeting way, but knew he could never forget the slightest thing about it. His throat closed suddenly again.

Brianna looked searchingly into his face, saw his hand touch the ragged rope scar on his throat.

â€œCan you breathe?â€ she said anxiously. He shook his head, but it wasnâ€™t true, he was breathing, somehow, though it felt as though his throat had been crushed in some huge hand, larynx and windpipe mangled into a bloody mass.

He flapped a hand to indicate that he would be all right, much as he doubted it himself. She came round behind him, pulled his hand from his throat, and laid her own fingers lightly over the scar.

â€œItâ€™ll be all right,â€ she said quietly. â€œJust breathe. Donâ€™t think. Just breathe.â€

Her fingers were cold and her hands smelled of dirt. There was water in his eyes. He blinked, wanting to see the room, the hearth and candle and dishes and loom, to convince himself of where he was. A drop of warm moisture rolled down his cheek.

He tried to tell her that it was all right, he wasnâ€™t crying, but she merely pressed closer, holding him across the chest with one arm, the other hand still cool on the painful lump in his throat. Her breasts were soft against his back, and he could feel, rather than hear, her humming, the small tuneless noise she made when she was anxious, or concentrating very hard.

Finally, the spasm began to ease, and the feel of choking left him. His chest swelled with the unbelievable relief of a free breath, and she let go.

â€œWhat . . . is it . . . that yeâ€™re digging?â€ he asked, with only a little effort. He looked round at her and smiled, with a lot more. â€œA bar . . . becue pit for . . . a hippopot . . . amus?â€

The ghost of a smile touched her face, though her eyes were still dark with concern.

â€œNo,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s a groundhog kiln.â€

He tried for a moment to compose some witty remark about it being a really large hole for killing something as small as a groundhog, but he wasnâ€™t up to it.

â€œOh,â€ he said instead.

He took the hot mug of catnip tea she placed in his hand and held it near his face, letting the fragrant steam warm his nose and mist on the cold skin of his cheeks.

Brianna poured out a mug for herself, as well, and sat down across from him.

â€œIâ€™m glad youâ€™re home,â€ she said softly.

â€œYeah. Me, too.â€ He essayed a sip; it was still scalding. â€œA kiln?â€ Heâ€™d told her about the Oâ€™Brians; he had to, but he didnâ€™t want to talk about it. Not now. She seemed to sense this, and didnâ€™t press him.

â€œUh-huh. For the water.â€ He must have looked confused, for her smile grew more genuine. â€œI told you there was dirt involved, didnâ€™t I? Besides, it was your idea.â€

â€œIt was?â€ At this point, almost nothing would surprise him, but he had no memory of having bright ideas about water.

The problem of bringing water to the houses was one of transport. God knew there was plenty of water; it ran in creeks, fell in waterfalls, dripped from ledges, sprang from springs, seeped in boggy patches under the cliffs . . . but making it go where you wanted required some method of containment.

â€œMr. Wemyss told Fraulein Berrischâ€”thatâ€™s his girlfriend; Frau Ute fixed them upâ€”what I was doing, and she told him that the menâ€™s choir over in Salem was working on the same problem, soâ€”â€

â€œThe choir?â€ He tried another cautious sip and found it drinkable. â€œWhy would the choirâ€”â€

â€œThatâ€™s just what they call them. Thereâ€™s the single menâ€™s choir, the single womenâ€™s choir, the married choir . . . they donâ€™t just sing together, though, itâ€™s more like a social group, and each choir has particular jobs they do for the community. But anywayâ€â€”she flapped a handâ€”â€œtheyâ€™re trying to bring water into the town, and having the same problemâ€”no metal for pipes.

â€œYou remember, thoughâ€”you reminded me about the pottery they do in Salem. Well, they tried making water pipes out of logs, but thatâ€™s really hard and time-consuming, because you have to bore the middle of the log out with an augur, and you still need metal collars to bind the logs together. And they rot, after a while. But then they had the same idea you hadâ€”why not make pipes out of fired clay?â€

She was becoming animated, talking about it. Her nose was no longer red from cold, but her cheeks were flushed pink and her eyes bright with interest. She waved her hands when she talkedâ€”she got that from her mother, he thought to himself, amused.

â€œ. . . so we parked the kids with Mama and Mrs. Bug, and Marsali and I went to Salemâ€”â€

â€œMarsali? But she couldnâ€™t be riding, surely?â€ Marsali was enormously pregnant, to the point that merely being around her made him slightly nervous, for fear she might go into labor at any moment.

â€œShe isnâ€™t due for a month. Besides, we didnâ€™t ride; we took the wagon, and traded honey and cider and venison for cheese and quilts andâ€”see my new teapot?â€ Proud, she waved at the pot, a homely squat thing with a red-brown glaze and yellow squiggly shapes painted round the middle. It was one of the uglier objects heâ€™d ever seen, and the sight of it made tears come to his eyes from the sheer joy of being home.

â€œYou donâ€™t like it?â€ she said, a small frown forming between her brows.

â€œNo, itâ€™s great,â€ he said hoarsely. He fumbled for a handkerchief and blew his nose to hide his emotion. â€œLove it. You were saying . . . Marsali?â€

â€œI was saying about the water pipes. Butâ€”thereâ€™s something about Marsali, too.â€ The frown deepened. â€œIâ€™m afraid Fergus isnâ€™t behaving very well.â€

â€œNo? Whatâ€™s he doing? Having a mad affair with Mrs. Crombie?â€

This suggestion was greeted with a withering look, but it didnâ€™t last.

â€œHeâ€™s gone a lot, for one thing, leaving poor Marsali to mind the children and do all the work.â€

â€œTotally normal, for the time,â€ he observed. â€œMost men do that. Your father does that. I do that; had ye not noticed?â€

â€œI noticed,â€ she said, giving him a faintly evil look. â€œBut what I mean is, most men do the heavy work, like plowing and planting, and let their wives manage the inside stuff, the cooking and the spinning and the weaving, and the laundry, and the preserving, andâ€”well, anyway, all that stuff. But Marsaliâ€™s doing it all, plus the kids and the outdoor work, and working at the malting floor. And when Fergus is home, heâ€™s grumpy and he drinks too much.â€

This also sounded like normal behavior for the father of three small, wild children and the husband of a very pregnant wife, Roger thought, but didnâ€™t say so.

â€œIâ€™d not have thought Fergus a layabout,â€ he observed mildly. Bree shook her head, still frowning, and poured more tea into his mug.

â€œNo, heâ€™s not lazy, really. Itâ€™s hard for him, with only one hand; he really canâ€™t handle some of the heavy choresâ€”but he wonâ€™t help with the kids, or cook and clean while Marsali does them. Da and Ian help with the plowing, but . . . And he leaves for days on endâ€”sometimes heâ€™s picking up little jobs here and there, translating for a travelerâ€”but mostly, heâ€™s just gone. And . . .â€ She hesitated, darting a look at him as though wondering whether to go on.

â€œAnd?â€ he said obligingly. The tea was working; the pain in his throat was almost gone.

She looked down at the table, drawing invisible patterns on the oak with a forefinger.

â€œShe didnâ€™t say so . . . but I think he hits her.â€

Roger felt a sudden weight on his heart. His first reaction was to dismiss the notion out of handâ€”but he had seen too much, living with the Reverend. Too many families, outwardly content and respectable, where the wives poked fun at their own â€œclumsiness,â€ brushing away concern at black eyes, broken noses, dislocated wrists. Too many men who dealt with the pressures of providing for a family by resorting to the bottle.

â€œDamn,â€ he said, feeling suddenly exhausted. He rubbed at his forehead, where a headache was starting.

â€œWhy do you think so?â€ he asked bluntly. â€œHas she got marks?â€

Bree nodded unhappily, still not looking up, though her finger had stilled.

â€œOn her arm.â€ She wrapped a hand around her forearm, in illustration. â€œLittle round bruises, like fingermarks. I saw when she reached up to get a bucket of honeycomb from the wagon and her sleeve fell back.â€

He nodded, wishing there was something stronger than tea in his mug.

â€œShall I talk to him, then, dâ€™ye think?â€

She did look up at him then, her eyes softening, though the look of worry remained.

â€œYou know, most men wouldnâ€™t offer to do that.â€

â€œWell, itâ€™s no my idea of fun,â€ he admitted. â€œBut ye canna let that sort of thing go on, hoping it will cure itself. Someone has to say something.â€

God knew what, thoughâ€”or how. He was already regretting the offer, trying to think what the hell he could say. â€œSo, Fergus, old man. Hear youâ€™re beating your wife. Be a good fellow and stop that, okay?â€

He drained the rest of his mug, and got up to look for the whisky.

â€œWeâ€™re out,â€ Brianna said, seeing his intent. â€œMr. Wemyss had a cold.â€

He put down the empty bottle with a sigh. She touched his arm delicately.

â€œWeâ€™re invited up to the Big House for supper. We could go early.â€ That was a cheering suggestion. Jamie invariably had a bottle of excellent single-malt, secreted somewhere on the premises.

â€œAye, all right.â€ He took her cloak from the peg and swung it round her shoulders. â€œHey. Dâ€™ye think I should mention the business about Fergus to your Da? Or best handle it myself?â€ He had a sudden, unworthy hope that Jamie would consider it his business and take care of the matter.

That seemed to be what Brianna was afraid of; she was shaking her head, simultaneously fluffing out her half-dried hair.

â€œNo! I think Da would break his neck. And Fergus wonâ€™t be any good to Marsali if heâ€™s dead.â€

â€œMmphm.â€ He accepted the inevitable, and opened the door for her. The big white house glowed on the hill above them, tranquil in the afternoon light, the big red spruce behind it a looming but benign presence; not for the first time, he felt that the tree was somehow guarding the houseâ€”and in his present fragile mental state, found that notion a comfort.

They made a short detour, so that he could properly admire the new pit and be told all about the internal workings of a groundhog kiln. He failed to follow these in any detail, only grasping the notion that the point was to make the inside very hot, but he found the flow of Briannaâ€™s explanation soothing.

â€œ. . . bricks for the chimney,â€ she was saying, pointing at the far end of the eight-foot pit, which at present resembled nothing so much as the resting place for an extremely large coffin. Sheâ€™d made a nice, neat job of it so far, though; the corners were squared as though done with a instrument of some sort, and the walls painstakingly smoothed. He said as much, and she beamed at him, thumbing a lock of red hair behind her ear.

â€œIt needs to be a lot deeper,â€ she said, â€œmaybe another three feet. But the dirt here is really good for digging; itâ€™s soft, but it doesnâ€™t crumble too much. I hope I can finish the hole before it starts to snow, but I donâ€™t know.â€ She rubbed a knuckle under her nose, squinting dubiously at the hole. â€œI really need to card and spin enough more wool to weave the fabric for winter shirts for you and Jem, but Iâ€™ll have to pick and preserve for the next week or so, andâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™ll dig it for you.â€

She stood on tiptoe and kissed him, just under the ear, and he laughed, suddenly feeling better.

â€œNot for this winter,â€ she said, taking him contentedly by the arm, â€œbut eventuallyâ€”Iâ€™m wondering if I can vent some of the heat from the kiln, and run it under the floor of the cabin. You know what a Roman hypocaust is?â€

â€œI do.â€ He turned to eye the foundation of his domicile, a simple hollow base of fieldstone on which the log walls were built. The notion of central heating in a crude mountain cabin made him want to laugh, but there was really nothing impossible about it, he supposed. â€œYouâ€™d what? Run pipes of warm air through the foundation stones?â€

â€œYes. Always assuming I can actually make good pipes, which remains to be seen. What do you think?â€

He glanced from the proposed project up the hill to the Big House. Even at this distance, a mound of dirt by the foundation was visible, evidence of the white sowâ€™s burrowing capabilities.

â€œI think ye run a great danger of having that big white buggeress transfer her affections to us, if ye make a cozy warm den under our house.â€

â€œBuggeress?â€ she said, diverted. â€œIs that physically possible?â€

â€œItâ€™s a metaphysical description,â€ he informed her. â€œAnd ye saw what she tried to do to Major MacDonald.â€

â€œThat pig really doesnâ€™t like Major MacDonald,â€ Bree said reflectively. â€œI wonder why not?â€

â€œAsk your mother; sheâ€™s none so fond of him, either.â€

â€œOh, well, thatâ€”â€ She stopped suddenly, lips pursed, and looked thoughtfully at the Big House. A shadow passed the window of the surgery, someone moving inside. â€œTell you what. You find Da and have a drink with him, and while youâ€™re doing that, Iâ€™ll tell Mama about Marsali and Fergus. She might have a good idea.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know that itâ€™s a medical problem, exactly,â€ he said. â€œBut anesthetizing Germain would certainly be a start.â€

THE MALTING-FLOOR




I COULD SMELL THE SWEET, musty scent of damp grain on the wind as I made my way up the trail. It was nothing like the heady pungency of the barm mash, the faintly coffeelike toasted smell of malting, nor yet the reek of distillingâ€”but still spoke as strongly of whisky. It was a very fragrant business, making uisgebaugh, and the reason why the whisky clearing was located nearly a mile from the Big House. As it was, I often caught a wild faint scent of spirit through my open surgery windows when the wind was right and the mash was making.

The whisky-making had its own cycle, and one that everyone on the Ridge was subconsciously attuned to, whether directly involved in it or not. Which was how I knew without asking that the barley in the malting shed had just begun its germination, and therefore, Marsali would be there, turning and spreading the grain evenly before the malting fire was lit.

The grain must be allowed to germinate, to assure a maximal sweetnessâ€”but must not sprout, or the mash would have a bitter taste and be ruined. No more than twenty-four hours must pass after germination began, and I had smelled the fecund damp scent of the grain begin to rise as I foraged in the woods the afternoon before. The time was here.

It was by far the best place to have a private conversation with Marsali; the whisky clearing was the only place she was ever without a cacophonous assortment of children. I often thought that she valued the solitude of the work much more than the share of whisky Jamie gave her for minding the grainâ€”valuable though that was.

Brianna told me that Roger had gallantly offered to have a word with Fergus, but I thought that I should talk to Marsali first, just to find out what was really going on.

What ought I to say? I wondered. A straightforward â€œIs Fergus beating you?â€ I couldnâ€™t quite believe that, despiteâ€”or perhaps because ofâ€”an intimate knowledge of emergency rooms filled with the debris of domestic disputes.

It wasnâ€™t that I thought Fergus incapable of violence; heâ€™d seenâ€”and experiencedâ€”any amount of it from an early age, and growing up among Highlanders in the middle of the Rising and its aftermath probably did not inculcate a young man with any deep regard for the virtues of peace. On the other hand, Jenny Murray had had a hand in his upbringing.

I tried and failed to imagine any man who had lived with Jamieâ€™s sister for more than a week ever lifting his hand to a woman. Besides, I knew by my own observations that Fergus was a very gentle father, and there was usually an easiness between him and Marsali that seemedâ€”

There was a sudden commotion overhead. Before I could so much as glance up, something huge crashed down through the branches in a shower of dust and dead pine needles. I leapt backward and swung my basket up in instinctive defenseâ€”but even as I did so, I realized that I was not in fact being attacked. Germain lay flat on the path in front of me, eyes bulging as he struggled for the breath that had been knocked out of him.

â€œWhat on earthâ€”?â€ I began, rather crossly. Then I saw that he was clutching something to his chest; a late nest, filled with a clutch of four greenish eggs, which he had miraculously contrived not to break in his fall.

â€œFor . . . Maman,â€ he gasped, grinning up at me.

â€œVery nice,â€ I said. I had had enough to do with young malesâ€”well, any age, really; they all did itâ€”to realize the complete futility of reproach in such situations, and since he had broken neither the eggs nor his legs, I merely took the nest and held it while he gulped for air and my heart resumed beating at its normal speed.

Recovered, he scrambled to his feet, disregarding the dirt, pitch, and broken pine needles that covered him from head to toe.

â€œMamanâ€™s in the shed,â€ he said, reaching for his treasure. â€œYou come too, GrandmÃ¨re?â€

â€œYes. Where are your sisters?â€ I asked suspiciously. â€œAre you meant to be watching them?â€

â€œNon,â€ he said airily. â€œThey are at home; thatâ€™s where women belong.â€

â€œOh, really? And who told you that?â€

â€œI forget.â€ Thoroughly recovered, he hopped ahead of me, singing a song, the refrain of which seemed to be â€œNa tuit, na tuit, na tuit, Germain!â€

Marsali was indeed at the whisky clearing; her cap, cloak, and gown hung from a branch of the yellow-leaved persimmon, and a clay firepot full of coals sat nearby, smoking in readiness.

The malting floor had been enclosed now by proper walls, making a shed in which the damp grain could be heaped, first to germinate and then to be gently toasted by a low-burning fire under the floor. The ash and charcoal had been scraped out and oak wood for a new fire laid in the space beneath the stilted floor, but it wasnâ€™t yet lit. Even without a fire, the shed was warm; I felt it from several feet away. As the grain germinated, it gave off such heat that the shed fairly glowed with it.

A rhythmic shush and scrape came from within; Marsali was turning the grain with a wooden shovel, making sure it was evenly spread before lighting the malting fire. The door of the shed was open, but there were of course no windows; from a distance, I could see only a dim shadow moving within.

The shushing of the grain had masked our footsteps; Marsali looked up, startled, when my body blocked the light from the doorway.

â€œMother Claire!â€

â€œHallo,â€ I said cheerfully. â€œGermain said you were here. I thought Iâ€™d justâ€”â€

â€œMaman! Look, look, see what I have!â€ Germain pushed past me with single-minded eagerness, thrusting out his prize. Marsali smiled at him, and pushed a damp strand of fair hair back behind her ear.

â€œOh, aye? Well, thatâ€™s grand, no? Letâ€™s take it out to the light, shall we, so I can have a proper look.â€

She stepped out of the shed, sighing in pleasure at the touch of the cool air. She was stripped to her shift, the muslin so wet with sweat that I could see not only the dark rounds of her areolae, but even the tiny bulge of her popped-out navel, where the cloth clung to the massive curves of her belly.

Marsali sat down with another huge sigh of relief, stretching her legs out, bare toes pointed. Her feet were somewhat swollen, and blue veins showed, distended, beneath the transparent skin of her legs.

â€œAh, itâ€™s good to sit! So then, a chuisle, show me what yeâ€™ve got.â€

I took the opportunity to circle round behind her, as Germain displayed his prize, and covertly check for bruises or other sinister signs.

She was thinâ€”but Marsali simply was thin, bar the bulge of her pregnancy, and always had been. Her arms were slender, but hard with muscle, as were her legs. There were smudges of tiredness beneath her eyesâ€”but she had three small children, after all, besides the discomforts of pregnancy to keep her awake. Her face was rosy and damp, thoroughly healthy-looking.

There were a couple of small bruises on her lower legs, but I dismissed those; pregnant women did bruise easily, and with all the obstructions presented by living in a log cabin and traversing wild mountains, there were few people on the Ridgeâ€”male or femaleâ€”not sporting the odd contusion.

Or was I only seeking excuses, not wanting to admit the possibility of what Brianna had suggested?

â€œOne for me,â€ Germain was explaining, touching the eggs, â€œand one for Joan, and one for FÃ©licitÃ©, and one for Monsieur Lâ€™Oeuf.â€ He pointed at the melonlike swell of her stomach.

â€œAh, now, what a sweet lad,â€ Marsali said, pulling him close and kissing his smudged forehead. â€œYeâ€™re my wee nestling, to be sure.â€

Germainâ€™s beam of pleasure faded into a look of speculation as he came in contact with his motherâ€™s protruding belly. He patted it cautiously.

â€œWhen the egg hatches inside, what do you do with the shell?â€ he inquired. â€œCan I have it?â€

Marsali went pink with suppressed laughter.

â€œPeople dinna come in shells,â€ she said. â€œThank God.â€

â€œYou are sure, Maman?â€ He eyed her belly dubiously, then poked it gently. â€œIt feels like an egg.â€

â€œWell, so it does, but itâ€™s not. Thatâ€™s only what Papa and I call a wee one before itâ€™s born. You were â€˜Monsieur Lâ€™Oeufâ€™ once, aye?â€

â€œI was?â€ Germain looked thunderstruck at this revelation.

â€œYe were. So were your sisters.â€

Germain frowned, shaggy blond fringe almost touching his nose.

â€œNo, they werenâ€™t. They are Mademoiselles Lâ€™Oeufs.â€

â€œOui, certainement,â€ Marsali said, laughing at him. â€œAnd perhaps this one is, tooâ€”but Monsieur is easier to say. Here, look.â€ She leaned back a little and pushed a hand firmly into the side of her mound. Then she seized Germainâ€™s hand and put it on the spot. Even from where I stood, I could see the surge of flesh as the baby kicked vigorously in response to being poked.

Germain jerked his hand away, startled, then put it back, looking fascinated, and pushed.

â€œHello!â€ he said loudly, putting his face close to his motherâ€™s belly. â€œComment Ã§a va in there, Monsieur Lâ€™Oeuf?â€

â€œHeâ€™s fine,â€ his mother assured him. â€œOr she. But babies dinna talk right at first. Ye ken that much. FÃ©licitÃ© doesna say anything but â€˜Mamaâ€™ yet.â€

â€œOh, aye.â€ Losing interest in his impending sibling, he stooped to pick up an interesting-looking stone.

Marsali lifted her head, squinting at the sun.

â€œYe should go home, Germain. Mirabel will be wanting milked, and Iâ€™ve a bit to do here yet. Go and help Papa, aye?â€ Mirabel was a goat, and a sufficiently new addition to the household as still to be interesting, for Germain brightened at the suggestion.

â€œOui, Maman. Auâ€™voir, GrandmÃ¨re!â€ He took aim and flipped his rock at the shed, missing it, then turned and scampered toward the path.

â€œGermain!â€ Marsali called after him. â€œNa tuit!â€

â€œWhat does that mean?â€ I asked curiously. â€œItâ€™s Gaelic, is itâ€”or French?â€

â€œItâ€™s the Gaelic,â€ she said, smiling. â€œIt means â€˜Donâ€™t fall!â€™â€ She shook her head in mock dismay. â€œThat laddie canna stay out of trees to save his life.â€ Germain had left the nest with its eggs; she set it gently on the ground, and I saw then the faint yellowed ovals on the underside of her forearmâ€”faded, but just as Brianna had described them.

â€œAnd how is Fergus?â€ I asked, as though it had anything to do with the conversation.

â€œHeâ€™s well enough,â€ she replied, a look of wariness closing over her features.

â€œReally?â€ I glanced deliberately at her arm, then into her eyes. She flushed, and turned her arm quickly, hiding the marks.

â€œAye, heâ€™s fine!â€ she said. â€œHeâ€™s no verra good at the milking just yet, but heâ€™ll have the way of it soon enough. Itâ€™s awkward wiâ€™ the one hand, to be sure, but heâ€™sâ€”â€

I sat down on the log beside her, and took hold of her wrist, turning it over.

â€œBrianna told me,â€ I said. â€œDid Fergus do this?â€

â€œOh.â€ She seemed embarrassed, and pulled her wrist away, pressing the forearm against her belly to hide the marks. â€œWell, aye. Aye, he did.â€

â€œDo you want me to speak to Jamie about it?â€

A rich tide of color surged into her face, and she sat up in alarm.

â€œChrist, no! Da would break Fergusâ€™s neck! And it wasna his fault, really.â€

â€œCertainly it was his fault,â€ I said firmly. I had seen all too many beaten women in Boston emergency rooms, all of whom claimed that it wasnâ€™t really their husbandâ€™s or boyfriendâ€™s fault. Granted, the women often did have something to do with it, but stillâ€”

â€œBut it wasnâ€™t!â€ Marsali insisted. The color had not gone from her face; if anything, it intensified. â€œIâ€”heâ€”I mean, he grabbed my arm, aye, but â€™twas only because I . . . er . . . well, I was tryinâ€™ to brain him wiâ€™ a stick of wood at the time.â€ She glanced away, blushing fiercely.

â€œOh.â€ I rubbed my nose, a little taken aback. â€œI see. And why were you trying to do that? Was he . . . attacking you?â€

She sighed, shoulders slumping a little.

â€œOh. No. Weel, it was because Joanie spilled the milk, and he shouted at her, and she cried, and . . .â€ She shrugged a little, looking uncomfortable. â€œI just had a wee deâ€™il sittinâ€™ on my shoulder, I suppose.â€

â€œItâ€™s not like Fergus to shout at the children, is it?â€

â€œOh, no, itâ€™s not!â€ she said quickly. â€œHe hardly ever . . . well, he didna used to, but with so many . . . well, I couldna blame him, this time. It took him a terrible time to milk the goat, and then to have it all spilt and wastedâ€”I would haâ€™ shouted, too, I expect.â€

Her eyes were fixed on the ground, avoiding mine, and she was fingering the seam of her shift, running a thumb over and over the stitching.

â€œSmall children can certainly be trying,â€ I agreed, with vivid memories of an incident involving a two-year-old Brianna, a phone call that had distracted me, a large bowl of spaghetti with meatballs, and Frankâ€™s open briefcase. Frank normally exhibited a saintly degree of patience with Breeâ€”if somewhat less with meâ€”but on that particular occasion his bellows of outrage had rattled the windows.

And now that I recalled the occasion, I actually had thrown a meatball at him in a fury verging on hysteria. So had Bree, though she had done it out of glee, rather than vindictiveness. Had I been standing by the stove at the time, it might easily have been the pot I threw. I rubbed a finger under my nose, not sure whether to regret the memory or to laugh at it. I never did get the stains out of the rug.

It was a shame that I couldnâ€™t share the memory with Marsali, as she was in ignorance not only of spaghetti and briefcases, but also of Frank. She was still looking down, scuffing at the dead oak leaves with a pointed toe.

â€œâ€™Twas all my fault, really,â€ she said, and bit her lip.

â€œNo, it wasnâ€™t.â€ I squeezed her arm in reassurance. â€œThings like that are no oneâ€™s fault; accidents happen, people get upset . . . but it all comes right in the end.â€ So it did, I thoughtâ€”though often not in any expected way.

She nodded, but the shadow still lay on her face, her lower lip tucked in.

â€œAye, itâ€™s only . . .â€ she began, then trailed off.

I sat patiently, careful not to push her. She wantedâ€”neededâ€”to talk. And I needed to hear it, before deciding whatâ€”or ifâ€”to tell Jamie. There was something going on between her and Fergus, that was sure.

â€œI . . . was just thinking of it now, whilst I was shoveling. I wouldna have done it, I donâ€™t think, only it minded me so much . . . it was only I felt as though it was the same again. . . .â€

â€œThe same as what?â€ I asked, when it became clear that she had trailed off.

â€œI spilt the milk,â€ she said, all in a rush. â€œWhen I was a wean. I was hungry, and I reached to pull the jug, and it spilled.â€

â€œOh?â€

â€œAye. And he shouted.â€ Her shoulders hunched a little, as though in memory of a blow.

â€œWho shouted?â€

â€œI dinna ken, for sure. It might haâ€™ been my father, Hughâ€”but it might have been Simonâ€”Mamâ€™s second husband. I dinna really rememberâ€”only beinâ€™ so scairt that I wet myself, and that made him angrier.â€ Color flamed in her face, and her toes curled with shame.

â€œMy mother cried, for it was all the food there was, a bit oâ€™ bread and milk, and now the milk was goneâ€”but he shouted that he couldna bear the noise, for Joan and I were both howling, too . . . and then he slapped my face, and Mam went for him bald-heided, and he pushed her so she fell against the hearth and smacked her face on the chimneyâ€”I could see the blood running from her nose.â€

She sniffed and brushed a knuckle under her own nose, blinking, her eyes still fixed on the leaves.

â€œHe stamped out, then, slamminâ€™ the door, and Joanie and I rushed up to Mam, both shriekinâ€™ our heids off, for we thought she was deid . . . but she got up onto her hands and knees and told us it was all right, it would be all rightâ€”and her swayinâ€™ to and fro, with her cap fallen off and strings of bloody snot dripping from her face onto the floor . . . Iâ€™d forgot that. But when Fergus started shouting at poor wee Joanie . . . â€™twas like he was Simon. Or maybe Hugh. Him, whoever he was.â€ She closed her eyes and heaved a deep sigh, leaning forward so her arms cradled the burden of her pregnancy.

I reached out and smoothed the damp strings of hair out of her face, brushing them back from her rounded brow.

â€œYou miss your mother, donâ€™t you?â€ I said softly. For the first time, I felt some sympathy for her mother, Laoghaire, as well as for Marsali.

â€œOh, aye,â€ Marsali said simply. â€œSomething terrible.â€ She sighed again, closing her eyes as she leaned her cheek against my hand. I drew her head against me, holding her, and stroked her hair in silence.

It was late afternoon, and the shadows lay long, cold in the oak wood. The heat had left her now, and she shivered briefly in the cooling air, a stipple of gooseflesh coming up on her fine-boned arms.

â€œHere,â€ I said, standing up and swinging the cloak off my shoulders. â€œPut this on. You donâ€™t want to take a chill.â€

â€œAh, no, itâ€™s all right.â€ She straightened up, shaking back her hair, and wiped her face with the back of a hand. â€œThereâ€™s no but a bit more to do here, and then Iâ€™ve got to be going home and making up the supperâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™ll do it,â€ I said firmly, and tucked the cloak around her shoulders. â€œYou rest a bit.â€

The air inside the tiny shed was ripe enough to make one light-headed, all by itself, thick with the fecund musk of sprouting grain and the fine sharp dust of barley hulls. The warmth was welcoming after the chill of the air outside, but within moments, my skin was damp beneath dress and shift, and I pulled the gown off over my head and hung it on a nail by the door.

No matter; she was right, there wasnâ€™t much to be done. The work would keep me warm, and then I would walk home with Marsali straightaway. I would make supper for the family, letting her restâ€”and while I was about it, Iâ€™d perhaps have a word with Fergus and discover more about what was going on.

Fergus could have been making the supper, I thought, frowning as I dug into the dim heaps of sticky grain. Not that he would think of such a thing, the little French layabout. Milking the goat was as far as he was likely to go in the direction of â€œwomenâ€™s work.â€

Then I thought of Joan and FÃ©licitÃ©, and felt more charitable toward Fergus. Joan was three, FÃ©licitÃ© one and a halfâ€”and anyone alone in a house with those two had my complete sympathy, no matter what kind of work they were doing.

Joan was outwardly a sweet brown wren of a child, and by herself was even-tempered and biddableâ€”to a point. FÃ©licitÃ© was the spitting image of her father, dark, fine-boned, and given to alternate bouts of languishing charm and intemperate passion. Together . . . Jamie referred to them casually as the hell-kits, and if they were at home, it was no wonder that Germain was out wandering in the woodsâ€”nor that Marsali found it a relief to be out here by herself, doing heavy labor.

â€œHeavyâ€ was the operative term, I thought, thrusting the shovel in again and heaving. Sprouting grain was damp grain, and each shovelful weighed pounds. The turned grain was patchy, splotched dark with moisture from the underlying layers. The unturned grain was paler in color, even in the failing light. Only a few mounds of pale grain remained, in the far corner.

I attacked them with a will, realizing as I did so that I was trying very hard not to think of the story Marsali had told me. I didnâ€™t want to like Laoghaireâ€”and I didnâ€™t. But I didnâ€™t want to feel sympathy for her, either, and that was proving harder to avoid.

It hadnâ€™t been an easy life for her, apparently. Well, nor had it been for anyone else living in the Highlands then, I thought, grunting as I flung a shovelful of grain to the side. Being a mother was not that easy anywhereâ€”but it seemed she had made a good job of it.

I sneezed from the grain dust, paused to wipe my nose on my sleeve, then went back to shoveling.

It wasnâ€™t as though she had tried to steal Jamie from me, after all, I told myself, striving for compassion and high-minded objectivity. Rather the reverse, in factâ€”or at least she might well see it that way.

The edge of the shovel gritted hard against the floor as I scraped up the last of the grain. I sent the grain flying to the side, then used the flat of the blade to shove some of the new-turned grain into the empty corner and smooth down the highest hillocks.

I knew all the reasons why he said heâ€™d married herâ€”and I believed him. However, the fact remained that the mention of her name conjured up assorted visionsâ€”starting with Jamie kissing her ardently in an alcove at Castle Leoch, and ending with him fumbling up her nightgown in the darkness of their marriage bed, hands warm and eager on her thighsâ€”that made me snort like a grampus and feel the blood throb hotly in my temples.

Perhaps, I reflected, I was not really a very high-minded sort of person. Occasionally quite low-minded and grudge-bearing, in fact.

This bout of self-criticism was cut short by the sound of voices and movement outside. I stepped to the door of the shed, squinting against the dazzle of the late afternoon sun.

I couldnâ€™t see their faces, nor even tell for sure how many there might be. Some were on horseback, some on foot, black silhouettes with the sinking sun behind them. I caught a movement in the corner of my eye; Marsali was on her feet, backing toward the shed.

â€œWho are ye, sirs?â€ she said, chin high.

â€œThirsty travelers, mistress,â€ said one of the black forms, edging his horse ahead of the others. â€œIn search of hospitality.â€

The words were courteous enough; the voice wasnâ€™t. I stepped out of the shed, still gripping the shovel.

â€œWelcome,â€ I said, making no effort to sound welcoming. â€œStay where you are, gentlemen; weâ€™ll be pleased to bring you a drink. Marsali, will you fetch the keg?â€

There was a small keg of raw whisky kept nearby for just such occasions. My heartbeat was loud in my ears, and I was clutching the wooden handle of the shovel so tightly that I could feel the grain of the wood.

It was more than unusual to see so many strangers in the mountains at one time. Now and then, we would see a hunting party of Cherokeeâ€”but these men were not Indians.

â€œNo bother, mistress,â€ said another of the men, swinging down off his horse. â€œIâ€™ll help her fetch it. I do think we shall be needing more than one keg, though.â€

The voice was English, and oddly familiar. Not a cultivated accent, but with a careful diction.

â€œWe have only one keg ready,â€ I said, slowly moving sideways and keeping my eyes on the man who had spoken. He was short and very slender, and moved with a stiff, jerky gait, like a marionette.

He was moving toward me; so were the others. Marsali had reached the woodpile, and was fumbling behind the chunks of oak and hickory. I could hear her breath, harsh in her throat. The keg was hidden in the woodpile. There was an ax lying next to the wood, too, I knew.

â€œMarsali,â€ I said. â€œStay there. Iâ€™ll come and help you.â€

An ax was a better weapon than a shovelâ€”but two women against . . . how many men? Ten . . . a dozen . . . more? I blinked, eyes watering against the sun, and saw several more walk out of the wood. I could see these clearly; one grinned at me and I had to steel myself not to look away. His grin broadened.

The short man was coming closer, too. I glanced at him, and a brief itch of recognition tickled me. Who the hell was he? I knew him; Iâ€™d seen him beforeâ€”and yet I hadnâ€™t any name to attach to the lantern jaws and narrow brow.

He stank of long-dried sweat, dirt ground into the skin, and the tang of dribbled urine; they all did, and the odor of them floated on the wind, feral as the stink of weasels.

He saw me recognize him; thin lips pulled in for a moment, then relaxed.

â€œMrs. Fraser,â€ he said, and the feeling of apprehension deepened sharply as I saw the look in his small, clever eyes.

â€œI think you have the advantage of me, sir,â€ I said, putting as bold a face on it as I might. â€œHave we met?â€

He didnâ€™t answer that. One side of his mouth turned up a little, but his attention was distracted by the two men who had lunged forward to take the keg as Marsali rolled it out of its hiding place. One had already seized the ax I had my eye on, and was about to stave in the top of the cask, when the thin man shouted at him.

â€œLeave it!â€

The man looked up at him, mouth open in heavy incomprehension.

â€œI said leave it!â€ the thin man snapped, as the other glanced from the cask to the ax and back in confusion. â€œWeâ€™ll take it with us; Iâ€™ll not have you all befuddled with drink now!â€

Turning to me, as though continuing a conversation, he said, â€œWhereâ€™s the rest of it?â€

â€œThatâ€™s all there is,â€ Marsali said, before I could answer. She was frowning at him, wary of him, but also angry. â€œTake it, then, and ye must.â€

The thin manâ€™s attention shifted to her for the first time, but he gave her no more than a casual glance before turning back to me.

â€œDonâ€™t trouble lying to me, Mrs. Fraser. I know well enough thereâ€™s more, and Iâ€™ll have it.â€

â€œThere is not. Give me that, ye great oaf!â€ Marsali snatched the ax neatly from the man holding it, and scowled at the thin man. â€œThis is how ye repay proper welcome, is itâ€”by thieving? Well, take what ye came for and leave, then!â€

I had no choice but to follow her lead, though alarm bells were ringing in my brain every time I looked at the thin little man.

â€œSheâ€™s right,â€ I said. â€œSee for yourselves.â€ I pointed at the shed, the mash tubs and the pot still that stood nearby, unsealed and patently empty. â€œWeâ€™re only beginning the malting. It will be weeks yet before thereâ€™s a new batch of whisky.â€

Without the slightest change of expression, he took a quick step forward and slapped me hard across the face.

The blow wasnâ€™t hard enough to knock me down, but it snapped my head back and left my eyes watering. I was more shocked than hurt, though there was a sharp taste of blood in my mouth, and I could already feel my lip beginning to puff.

Marsali uttered a sharp cry of shock and outrage, and I heard some of the men murmur in interested surprise. They had drawn in, surrounding us.

I put the back of my hand to my bleeding mouth, noticing in a detached sort of way that it was trembling. My brain, though, had withdrawn to a safe distance and was making and discarding suppositions so quickly that they fluttered past, fast as shuffling cards.

Who were these men? How dangerous were they? What were they prepared to do? The sun was settingâ€”how long before Marsali or I was missed and someone came looking for us? Would it be Fergus, or Jamie? Even Jamie, if he came alone . . .

I had no doubt that these men were the same who had burned Tige Oâ€™Brianâ€™s house, and were likely responsible for the attacks inside the Treaty Line, as well. Vicious, thenâ€”but with theft as their major purpose.

There was a copper taste in my mouth; the metal tang of blood and fear. No more than a second had passed in these calculations, but as I lowered my hand, I had concluded that it would be best to give them what they wanted, and hope that they left with the whisky at once.

I had no chance to say so, though. The thin man seized my wrist and twisted viciously. I felt the bones shift and crack with a tearing pain, and sank to my knees in the leaves, unable to make more than a small, breathless sound.

Marsali made a louder sound and moved like a striking snake. She swung the ax from the shoulder with all the power of her bulk behind it, and the blade sank deep in the shoulder of the man beside her. She wrenched it free and blood sprayed warm across my face, pattering like rain upon the leaves.

She screamed, high and thin, and the man screamed, too, and then the whole clearing was in motion, men surging inward with a roar like collapsing surf. I lunged forward and seized the thin manâ€™s knees, butted my head hard upward into his crotch. He made a choking wheeze and fell on top of me, flattening me to the ground.

I squirmed out from under his knotted body, knowing only that I had to get to Marsali, get between her and the menâ€”but they were upon her. A scream cut in half by the sound of fists on flesh, and a dull boom as bodies fell hard against the wall of the malting shed.

The clay firepot was in reach. I seized it, heedless of its searing heat, and flung it straight into the group of men. It struck one hard in the back and shattered, hot coals spraying. Men yelled and jumped back, and I saw Marsali slumped against the shed, neck canted over on one shoulder and her eyes rolled back white in her head, legs splayed wide and the shift torn down from her neck, leaving her heavy breasts bare on the bulge of her belly.

Then someone struck me in the side of the head and I flew sideways, skidding through the leaves and ending boneless, flat on the ground, unable to rise or move or think or speak.

A great calm came over me and my vision narrowedâ€”it seemed very slowlyâ€”the closing of some great iris, spiraling shut. Before me, I saw the nest on the ground, inches from my nose, its interwoven sticks slender, clever, the four greenish eggs round and fragile, perfect in its cup. Then a heel smashed down on the eggs and the iris closed.



THE SMELL OF BURNING roused me. I could have been unconscious for no more than moments; the clump of dry grass near my face was barely beginning to smoke. A hot coal glowed in a nest of char, shot with sparks. Threads of incandescence shot up the withered grass blades and the clump burst into flame, just as hands seized me by arm and shoulder, dragging me up.

Still dazed, I flailed at my captor as he lifted me, but was hustled unceremoniously to one of the horses, heaved up, and flung across the saddle with a force that knocked the wind out of me. I had barely the presence of mind to grab at the stirrup leather, as someone smacked the horseâ€™s rump and we set off at a bruising trot.

Between dizziness and jostling, everything I saw was fractured, crazed like broken glassâ€”but I caught one last glimpse of Marsali, now lying limp as a rag doll among a dozen tiny fires, as the scattered coals began to catch and burn.

I made some strangled noise, trying to call to her, but it was lost in the clatter of harness and menâ€™s voices, speaking urgently, near at hand.

â€œYou crazed, Hodge? You donâ€™t want that woman. Put her back!â€

â€œI shanâ€™t.â€ The small manâ€™s voice sounded cross, but controlled, somewhere near at hand. â€œSheâ€™ll show us to the whisky.â€

â€œWhiskyâ€™ll do us no good if weâ€™re dead, Hodge! Thatâ€™s Jamie Fraserâ€™s wife, for Christâ€™s sake!â€

â€œI know who she is. Get on with you!â€

â€œBut heâ€”you donâ€™t know the man, Hodge! I see him one timeâ€”â€

â€œSpare me your memories. Get on, I said!â€

This last was punctuated by a sudden vicious thunk, and a startled sound of pain. A pistol butt, I thought. Square across the face, I added mentally, swallowing as I heard the wet, wheezing gasps of a man with a broken nose.

A hand seized me by the hair and jerked my head round painfully. The thin manâ€™s face stared down at me, eyes narrowed in calculation. He seemed only to want to assure himself that I was indeed alive, for he said nothing, and dropped my head again, indifferent as though it were a pinecone he had picked up along the way.

Someone was leading the horse I was on; there were several men on foot, as well. I heard them, calling to one another, half-running to keep up as the horses lurched up a rise, crashing and grunting like pigs through the undergrowth.

I couldnâ€™t breathe, save in shallow gasps, and was being jolted unmercifully with each stepâ€”but I had no attention to spare for physical discomfort. Was Marsali dead? She had looked it, surely, but Iâ€™d seen no blood, and I clung to that small fact for the slimâ€”and temporaryâ€”comfort that it was.

Even if she wasnâ€™t dead yet, she soon might be. Whether from injury, shock, a sudden miscarriageâ€”oh, God, oh, God, poor little Monsieur Lâ€™Oeufâ€”

My hands clenched helpless on the stirrup leathers, desperate. Who might find herâ€”and when?

It had lacked little more than an hour to suppertime when I had arrived at the malting shed. How late was it now? I caught glimpses of the ground juddering past below, but my hair had come loose and streamed across my face whenever I tried to raise my head. There was a growing chill to the air, though, and a still look to the light that told me the sun was near the horizon. Within a few minutes, the light would start to fade.

And then what? How long before a search began? Fergus would notice Marsaliâ€™s absence when she didnâ€™t appear to cook supperâ€”but would he go to look for her, with the little girls in his care? No, heâ€™d send Germain. That caused my heart to lurch and catch in my throat. For a five-year-old boy to find his mother . . .

I could still smell burning. I sniffed, once, twice, again, hoping that I was imagining it. But above the dust and sweat of horse, the tang of stirrup leather, and the whiff of crushed plants, I could distinctly smell the reek of smoke. The clearing, the shedâ€”or bothâ€”were well and truly alight now. Someone would see the smoke, and come. But in time?

I shut my eyes tight, trying to stop thinking, seeking any distraction to keep from seeing in my mindâ€™s eye the scene that must be taking place behind me.

There were still voices near. The man they called Hodge again. It must be his horse I rode; he was walking near its head, on the far side of the animal. Someone else was expostulating with him, but to no more effect than the first man.

â€œSpread them out,â€ he was saying tersely. â€œDivide the men in two groupsâ€”youâ€™ll â€™ave one, the rest go with me. Join again in three daysâ€™ time at Brownsville.â€

Bloody hell. He expected pursuit, and meant to frustrate it by splitting his group and confusing the trail. Frantically, I tried to think of something to drop; surely I had something to leave as a means of telling Jamie which way I had been taken.

But I wore nothing save shift, stays, and stockingsâ€”my shoes had been lost when they dragged me to the horse. The stockings seemed the only possibility; though the garters, with extreme perversity, were for once snugly tied, and quite out of my reach at the moment.

All around me I could hear the noise of men and horses moving, calling and shoving as the main body split. Hodge chirruped to the horse, and we began to move faster.

My floating hair snagged on a twig as we brushed past a bush, held for a second, then broke free with a painful ping! as the twig snapped, ricocheting off my cheekbone and narrowly missing my eye. I said something very rude, and someoneâ€”Hodge, for a guessâ€”dealt me a censorious smack across the bottom.

I said something much, much ruder, but under my breath and through clenched teeth. My sole comfort was the thought that it would be no great trick to follow a band such as this, leaving as they were a wide trail of broken branches, hoofprints, and overturned stones.

Iâ€™d seen Jamie track things small and sly, as well as large and lumberingâ€”and had seen him check the bark of trees and the twigs of bushes as he went, for scratched bark and betraying tufts of . . . hair.

No one was walking on the side of the horse where my head hung down. Hastily, I began to pluck hairs from my head. Three, four, fiveâ€”was that enough? I stretched out my hand and dragged it through a yaupon bush; the long, curly hairs drifted on the breeze of the horseâ€™s passing, but stayed safely tangled in the jagged foliage.

I did the same thing four times more. Surely he would see at least one of the signs, and would know which trail to followâ€”if he didnâ€™t waste time following the other first. There was nothing I could do about that save prayâ€”and I set in to do that in good earnest, beginning first with a plea for Marsali and Monsieur le Oeuf, whose need was plainly much greater than mine.

We continued upward for quite some time; it was full dark before we reached what seemed to be the summit of a ridge, and I was nearly unconscious, my head throbbing with blood and my stays pushed so hard into my body that I felt each strip of whalebone like a brand against my skin.

I had just enough energy left to push myself backward when the horse stopped. I hit the ground and crumpled at once into a heap, where I sat light-headed and gasping, rubbing my hands, which had swollen from hanging down for so long.

The men were gathered in a small knot, occupied in low-voiced conversation, but too near for me to think of trying to creep away into the shrubbery. One man stood only a few feet away, keeping a steady eye on me.

I looked back the way we had come, half-fearing, half-hoping to see the glow of fire far below. The fire would have drawn attention from someoneâ€”someone would know by now what had happened, be even now spreading the alarm, organizing pursuit. And yet . . . Marsali.

Was she already dead, and the baby with her?

I swallowed hard, straining my eyes at the dark, as much to prevent tears as in hopes of seeing anything. As it was, though, the trees grew thick around us, and I could see nothing at all, save variations on inky blackness.

There was no light; the moon had not yet risen, and the stars were still faintâ€”but my eyes had had more than enough time to adapt, and while I was no cat to see in the dark, I could distinguish enough to make a rough count. They were arguing, glancing at me now and then. Perhaps a dozen men . . . How many had there been, originally? Twenty? Thirty?

I flexed my fingers, trembling. My wrist was badly bruised, but that wasnâ€™t what was troubling me at present.

It was clear to meâ€”and therefore presumably to them, as wellâ€”that they couldnâ€™t head directly for the whisky cache, even were I able to find it at night. Whether Marsali survived to talk or notâ€”I felt my throat close at the thoughtâ€”Jamie would likely realize that the whisky was the intrudersâ€™ goal, and have it guarded.

Had things not fallen out as they did, the men would ideally have forced me to lead them to the cache, taken the whisky, and fled, hoping to escape before the theft was discovered. Leaving me and Marsali alive to raise the alarm and describe them? I wondered. Perhaps; perhaps not.

In the panic following Marsaliâ€™s attack, though, the original plan had fallen apart. Now what?

The knot of men was breaking up, though the argument continued. Footsteps approached.

â€œI tell you, it wonâ€™t do,â€ one man was saying heatedly. From the thickened voice, I assumed it was the gentleman with the broken nose, undeterred by his injury. â€œKill her now. Leave her here; no oneâ€™ll find her before the beasts have scattered her bones.â€

â€œAye? And if no one finds her, theyâ€™ll think sheâ€™s still with us, wonâ€™t they?â€

â€œBut if Fraser catches up to us, and sheâ€™s not, who shall he blame . . .â€

They stopped, four or five of them surrounding me. I scrambled to my feet, my hand closing by reflex around the nearest thing approaching a weaponâ€”an unfortunately small rock.

â€œHow far are we from the whisky?â€ Hodge demanded. He had taken off his hat, and his eyes gleamed, ratlike in the shadow.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I said, keeping a firm grip on my nervesâ€”and the rock. My lip was still tender, puffed from the blow he had dealt me, and I had to form the words carefully. â€œI donâ€™t know where we are.â€

This was true, though I could have made a reasonable guess. We had traveled for a few hours, mostly upward, and the trees nearby were fir and balsam; I could smell their resin, sharp and clean. We were on the upper slopes, and probably near a small pass that crossed the shoulder of the mountain.

â€œKill her,â€ urged one of the others. â€œSheâ€™s no good to us, and if Fraser finds her with usâ€”â€

â€œShut your face!â€ Hodge rounded on the speaker with such violence that the man, much larger, stepped back involuntarily. That threat disposed of, Hodge ignored him and seized me by the arm.

â€œDonâ€™t play coy with me, woman. Youâ€™ll tell me what I want to know.â€ He didnâ€™t bother with the â€œor elseâ€â€”something cold passed across the top of my breast, and the hot sting of the cut followed a second later, as blood began to bloom from it.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ!â€ I said, more from surprise than pain. I jerked my arm out of his grasp. â€œI told you, I donâ€™t even know where we are, you idiot! How do you expect me to tell you where anything else is?â€

He blinked, startled, and brought the knife up by reflex, wary, as though he thought I might attack him. Realizing that I wasnâ€™t about to, he scowled at me.

â€œIâ€™ll tell you what I do know,â€ I said, and was distantly pleased to hear that my voice was sharp and steady. â€œThe whisky cache is about half a mile from the malting shed, roughly northwest. Itâ€™s in a cave, well-hidden. I could take you thereâ€”if we began from the spring where you took meâ€”but thatâ€™s all I can tell you in the way of direction.â€

This was true, too. I could find it easily enoughâ€”but to give directions? â€œGo through a gap in the brush a little way, until you see the cluster of oak where Brianna shot a possum, bear left to a squarish rock with a bunch of adderâ€™s-tongue growing over it. . . .â€ The fact that the need for my services as a guide was probably all that kept them from killing me on the spot was, of course, a secondary consideration.

It was a very shallow cut; I wasnâ€™t bleeding badly at all. My face and hands were ice-cold, though, and small flashing lights came and went at the edges of my vision. Nothing was keeping me upright save a vague conviction that if it came to that, I preferred to die on my feet.

â€œI tell you, Hodge, you donâ€™t want nothing to do with that oneâ€”nothing.â€ A larger man had joined the small group round me. He leaned over Hodgeâ€™s shoulder, looking at me, and nodded. They were all black in the shadow, but this man had a voice tinged with the lilt of Africaâ€”an ex-slave, or perhaps a slave-trader. â€œThat womanâ€”I hear about her. She is a conjure woman. I know them. They are like serpents, conjure wives. You donâ€™t touch that one, hear me? She will curse you!â€

I managed to give a rather nasty-sounding laugh in answer to this, and the man closest to me took a half-step back. I was vaguely surprised; where had that come from?

But I was breathing better now, and the flashing lights were gone.

The tall man stretched his neck, seeing the dark line of blood on my shift.

â€œYou draw her blood? Damn you, Hodge, you done it now.â€ There was a distinct note of alarm in his voice, and he drew back a little, making some sort of sign toward me with one hand.

Without the slightest notion as to what moved me to do it, I dropped the rock, ran the fingers of my right hand across the cut, and in one swift motion, reached out and drew them down the thin manâ€™s cheek. I repeated the nasty laugh.

â€œCurse, is it?â€ I said. â€œHowâ€™s this? Touch me again, and youâ€™ll die within twenty-four hours.â€

The streaks of blood showed dark on the white of his face. He was close enough that I could smell the sourness of his breath, and see the fury gather on his face.

What on earth do you think you are doing, Beauchamp? I thought, utterly surprised at myself. Hodge drew back his fist to strike me, but the large man caught him by the wrist with a cry of fear.

â€œDonâ€™t you do that! You will kill us all!â€

â€œIâ€™ll frigginâ€™ kill you right now, arsebite!â€

Hodge was still holding the knife in his other hand; he stabbed awkwardly at the larger man, grunting with rage. The big man gasped at the impact, but wasnâ€™t badly strickenâ€”he wrenched at the wrist he held and Hodge gave a high, squealing cry, like a rabbit seized by a fox.

Then the others were all in it, pushing and shouting, grappling for weapons. I turned and ran, but got no more than a few steps before one of them grabbed me, flinging his arms round me and jerking me hard against himself.

â€œYouâ€™re not going anywhere, lady,â€ he said, panting in my ear.

I wasnâ€™t. He was no taller than I, but a good deal stronger. I lunged against his grip, but he had both arms wrapped tight around me, and squeezed tighter. I stood stiff then, heart pounding with anger and fear, not wanting to give him an excuse to maul me. He was excited; I could feel his heart pounding, too, and smell the reek of fresh sweat over the fetor of stale clothes and body.

I couldnâ€™t see what was going on, but I didnâ€™t think they were fighting so much as merely shouting at each other now. My captor shifted his weight and cleared his throat.

â€œAhh . . . where do you come from, maâ€™am?â€ he asked, quite politely.

â€œWhat?â€ I said, no end startled. â€œCome from? Er . . . ah . . . England. Oxfordshire, originally. Then Boston.â€

â€œOh? Iâ€™m from the north myself.â€

I repressed the automatic urge to reply, â€œPleased to meet you,â€ since I wasnâ€™t, and the conversation languished.

The fight had stopped, abruptly as it had started. With a lot of token snarling and growling, the rest of them backed down in the face of Hodgeâ€™s bellowed assertions that he was in command here, and theyâ€™d bleedinâ€™ well do as he said or take the consequences.

â€œHe means it, too,â€ muttered my captor, still pressing me firmly to his filthy bosom. â€œYou donâ€™t want to cross him, lady, believe me.â€

â€œHmph,â€ I said, though I assumed the advice was well-meant. I had been hoping the conflict would be noisy and prolonged, thus increasing the chances of Jamie catching up to us.

â€œAnd where is this Hodge from, speaking of origins?â€ I asked. He still seemed remarkably familiar to me; I was sure I had seen him somewhereâ€”but where?

â€œHodgepile? Ahhh . . . England, I reckon,â€ said the young man gripping me. He sounded surprised. â€œDonâ€™t he sound like it?â€

Hodge? Hodgepile? That rang a bell, certainly, but . . .

There was a good deal of muttering and milling round, but in much too little time, we were off again. This time, thank God, I was allowed to ride astride, though my hands were tied and bound to the saddle.

We moved very slowly; there was a trail of sorts, but even with the faint light shed by a rising moon, the going was difficult. Hodgepile no longer led the horse I rode; the young man who had recaptured me held the bridle, tugging and coaxing the increasingly reluctant horse through the thickets of brush. I could glimpse him now and then, slender, with thick, wild hair that hung past his shoulders and rendered him lion-maned in silhouette.

The threat of immediate death had receded a little, but my stomach was still knotted and the muscles of my back stiff with apprehension. Hodgepile had his way for the moment, but there had been no real agreement among the men; one of those in favor of killing me and leaving my corpse for the skunks and weasels might easily decide to put a quick end to the controversy with a lunge out of the dark.

I could hear Hodgepileâ€™s voice, sharp and hectoring, somewhere up ahead. He seemed to be passing up and down the column, bullying, nagging, nipping like a sheepdog, trying to keep his flock on the move.

They were moving, though it was clear even to me that the horses were tired. The one I rode was shambling, jerking her head with irritation. God knew where the marauders had come from, or how long they had traveled before reaching the whisky clearing. The men were slowing, too, a gradual fog of fatigue settling on them as the adrenaline of flight and conflict receded. I could feel lassitude stealing upon me, too, and fought against it, struggling to stay alert.

It was still early autumn, but I was wearing only my shift and stays, and we were high enough that the air chilled rapidly after dark. I shivered constantly, and the cut on my chest burned as the tiny muscles flexed beneath the skin. It wasnâ€™t at all serious, but what if it became infected? I could only hope that I would live long enough for that to be a problem.

Hard as I tried, I could not keep from thinking of Marsali, nor keep my mind from making medical speculations, envisioning everything from concussion with intracranial swelling to burns with smoke inhalation. I could do somethingâ€”perhaps even an emergency C-sectionâ€”if I were there. No one else could.

I clenched my hands hard on the edge of the saddle, straining against the rope that bound them. I needed to be there!

But I was not, and might never be.

The quarreling and muttering had all but ceased as the darkness of the forest closed in upon us, but a lingering sense of unease lay heavy on the group. In part, I thought it was apprehension and fear of pursuit, but in much greater part, a sense of internal discord. The fight had not been settled, merely postponed to a more convenient season. A sense of simmering conflict was sharp in the air.

A conflict focused squarely on me. Unable to see clearly during the argument, I couldnâ€™t be sure which men held which opinions, but the division was clear: one party, headed by Hodgepile, was in favor of keeping me alive, at least long enough to lead them to the whisky. A second group was for cutting their losses, and my throat. And a minority opinion, voiced by the gentleman with the African speech, was for turning me loose, the sooner the better.

Obviously, it would behoove me to cultivate this gentleman, and try to turn his beliefs to my advantage. How? Iâ€™d made a start by cursing Hodgepileâ€”and I was still quite startled that Iâ€™d done that. I didnâ€™t think it would be advisable to start cursing them wholesale, thoughâ€”ruin the effect.

I shifted in the saddle, which was beginning to chafe me badly. This wasnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™d had men recoil from me in fear of what they thought I was. Superstitious fear could be an effective weaponâ€”but it was a very dangerous one to use. If I truly frightened them, theyâ€™d kill me without a momentâ€™s hesitation.

We had crossed into the pass. There were few trees among the boulders here, and as we emerged onto the far side of the mountain, the sky opened out before me, vast and glowing, fiery with a multitude of stars.

I must have let out a gasp at the sight, for the young man leading my horse paused, lifting his own head skyward.

â€œOh,â€ he said softly. He stared for a moment, then was pulled back to earth by the passage of another horse that brushed past us, its rider turning to peer closely at me as it did so.

â€œDid you have stars like thisâ€”where you came from?â€ my escort asked.

â€œNo,â€ I said, still slightly under the spell of the silent grandeur overhead. â€œNot so bright.â€

â€œNo, they werenâ€™t,â€ he said, shaking his head, and pulled at the rein. That seemed an odd remark, but I could make nothing of it. I might have engaged him in further conversationâ€”God knew I needed all the allies I could getâ€”but there was a shout from up ahead; evidently, we were making camp.

I was untied and pulled off the horse. Hodgepile pushed his way through the scrum and grasped me by the shoulder.

â€œYou try to run, woman, and youâ€™ll wish you â€™adnâ€™t.â€ He squeezed viciously, fingers digging into my flesh. â€œI need you aliveâ€”I donâ€™t need you â€™ole.â€

Still gripping my shoulder, he lifted his knife and pressed the flat of the blade against my lips, jammed the tip of it up my nose, then leaned close enough that I felt the moist warmth of his very repugnant breath on my face.

â€œThe one thing I wonâ€™t cut off is your tongue,â€ he whispered. The knife blade drew slowly out of my nose, down my chin, along the line of my neck, and circled round the curve of my breast. â€œYou take my meaning, do you?â€

He waited until I managed a nod, then released me and disappeared into the darkness.

If he meant to unnerve me, heâ€™d managed nicely. I was sweating despite the chill, and still shaking when a tall shadow loomed up beside me, took one of my hands, and pressed something into it.

â€œMy name is Tebbe,â€ he murmured. â€œYou remember thatâ€”Tebbe. Remember I was good to you. Tell your spirits they donâ€™t hurt Tebbe, he was good to you.â€

I nodded once more, astonished, and was left again, this time with a lump of bread in my hand. I ate it hastily, observing that while very stale, it had originally been good dark rye bread, of the sort the German women of Salem made. Had the men attacked some house near there, or merely bought the bread?

A horseâ€™s saddle had been flung down on the ground near me; a canteen hung from the pommel, and I sank down on my knees to drink from it. The bread and the waterâ€”tasting of canvas and woodâ€”tasted better than anything Iâ€™d eaten in a long while. Iâ€™d noticed before that standing very close to death improves the appetite remarkably. Still, I did hope for something more elaborate as a last meal.

Hodgepile returned a few minutes later, with rope. He didnâ€™t bother with further threats, evidently feeling that heâ€™d made his point. He merely tied me hand and foot, and pushed me down on the ground. No one spoke to me, but someone, with a kindly impulse, threw a blanket over me.

The camp settled quickly. No fire was lit, and so no supper was cooked; the men presumably refreshed themselves in the same makeshift way I had, then scattered into the wood to seek their rest, leaving the horses tethered a little way off.

I waited until the comings and goings died down, then took the blanket in my teeth and wriggled carefully away from the spot where I had been placed, making my way inchworm fashion to another tree, a dozen yards away.

I had no thought of escape in doing this; but if one of the bandits in favor of disposing of me should think to take advantage of the darkness in order to achieve their aims, I didnâ€™t mean to be lying there like a staked goat. With luck, if anyone came skulking round the spot where Iâ€™d been, I would have enough warning to scream for help.

I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that Jamie would come. My job was to survive until he did.

Panting, sweating, covered with crumbled leaves and with my stockings in rags, I curled up under a big hornbeam, and burrowed back under the blanket. Thus concealed, I had a try at undoing the knots in the rope around my wrists with my teeth. Hodgepile had tied them, though, and had done so with military thoroughness. Short of gnawing gopherlike through the ropes themselves, I was going nowhere.

Military. It was that thought that recalled suddenly to me who he was, and where I had seen him before. Arvin Hodgepile! He had been the clerk at the Crownâ€™s warehouse in Cross Creek. I had met him briefly, three years before, when Jamie and I brought the body of a murdered girl to the sergeant of the garrison there.

Sergeant Murchison was deadâ€”and Iâ€™d thought Hodgepile was, as well, killed in the conflagration that had destroyed the warehouse and its contents. So, a deserter, then. Either he had had time to escape the warehouse before it went up in flames, or had simply not been there at the time. In either case, heâ€™d been clever enough to realize that he could take this opportunity to disappear from His Majestyâ€™s army, leaving his death to be assumed.

What he had been doing since then was clear, too. Wandering the countryside, stealing, robbing, and killingâ€”and collecting a number of like-minded companions along the way.

Not that they appeared to be of one mind just at present. While Hodgepile might be the self-proclaimed leader of this gang at the moment, it was plain to see that he hadnâ€™t held the position for long. He wasnâ€™t accustomed to command, didnâ€™t know how to manage men, save by threat. Iâ€™d seen many military commanders in my time, good and bad, and recognized the difference.

I could hear Hodgepile even now, voice raised in distant argument with someone. Iâ€™d seen his sort before, vicious men who could temporarily cow those near them by outbursts of unpredictable violence. They seldom lasted longâ€”and I doubted that Hodgepile was going to last much longer.

He wasnâ€™t going to last any longer than it took for Jamie to find us. That thought calmed me like a slug of good whisky. Jamie would surely be looking for me by now.

I curled tighter under my blanket, shivering a little. Jamie would need light to track at nightâ€”torches. That would make him and his party visibleâ€”and vulnerableâ€”if they came within sight of the camp. The camp itself wouldnâ€™t be visible; there was no fire lit, and the horses and men were scattered through the wood. I knew sentries had been posted; I could hear them moving in the wood now and then, talking low-voiced.

But Jamie was no fool, I told myself, trying to drive away visions of ambush and massacre. He would know, from the freshness of the horsesâ€™ dung, if he were drawing close, and certainly wouldnâ€™t be marching right up to the camp, torches blazing. If he had tracked the party this far, he wouldâ€”

The sound of quiet footsteps froze me. They were coming from the direction of my original resting place, and I cowered under my blanket like a field mouse with a weasel in sight.

The steps shuffled slowly to and fro, as though someone was poking his way through the dried leaves and pine needles, looking for me. I held my breath, though surely no one could hear that, with the night wind sighing through the branches overhead.

I strained my eyes at the darkness, but could make out nothing more than a faint blur moving among the tree trunks, a dozen yards away. A sudden thought struck meâ€”could it be Jamie? If he had come close enough to locate the camp, he would very likely steal in on foot, looking for me.

I drew breath at the thought, straining against my bonds. I wanted urgently to call out, but didnâ€™t dare. If it should be Jamie, calling to him would expose his presence to the bandits. If I could hear the sentries, they could certainly hear me.

But if it were not Jamie, but one of the bandits, seeking to kill me quietly . . .

I let my breath out very slowly, every muscle in my body clenched and trembling. It was cool enough, but I was bathed in sweat; I could smell my own body, the reek of fear mingling with the colder smells of earth and vegetation.

The blur had vanished, the footsteps gone, and my heart was pounding like a kettledrum. The tears I had held back for hours seeped out, hot on my face, and I wept, shaking silently.

The night was immense around me, the darkness filled with threat. Overhead, the stars hung bright and watchful in the sky, and at some point, I slept.

CURSES




I WOKE JUST BEFORE DAWN, in a muck sweat and with a throbbing headache. The men were already moving, grumbling about the lack of coffee or breakfast.

Hodgepile stopped beside me, looking down with narrowed eyes. He glanced toward the tree beneath which he had left me the night before and the deep furrow of disturbed leaf mold I had created in worm-crawling toward my present spot. He had very little in the way of lips, but his lower jaw compressed in displeasure.

He pulled the knife from his belt, and I felt the blood drain from my face. However, he merely knelt and cut my bonds, rather than slicing off a finger by way of expressing his emotions.

â€œWe leave in five minutes,â€ he said, and stalked off. I was quivering and faintly nauseated with fear, and so stiff that I could barely stand. I managed to get to my feet, though, and staggered the short distance to a small stream.

The air was damp and I was now chilly in my sweat-soaked shift, but cold water splashed on my hands and face seemed to help a little, soothing the throb behind my right eye. I had just time to make a hasty toilet, removing the rags of my stockings and running wet fingers through my hair, before Hodgepile reappeared to march me off again.

This time, I was put on a horse, but not tied, thank God. I wasnâ€™t allowed to hold the reins, though; my mount was on a leading rein, held by one of the bandits.

It was my first chance to get a good look at my captors, as they came out of the wood and shook themselves into rough order, coughing, spitting, and urinating on trees without reference to my presence. Beyond Hodgepile, I counted twelve more menâ€”a bakerâ€™s dozen of villains.

It was easy to pick out the man called Tebbe; his height aside, he was a mulatto. There was another man of mixed bloodâ€”black and Indian, I thoughtâ€”but he was short and squat. Tebbe didnâ€™t glance in my direction, but went about his business with head lowered, scowling.

That was a disappointment; I didnâ€™t know what had passed among the men during the night, but evidently Tebbeâ€™s insistence that I be released was no longer so insistent. A rust-spotted kerchief bound his wrist; that might have something to do with it.

The young man who had guided my horse the night before was also easy to pick out, by way of his long, bushy hair, but he didnâ€™t come near, and avoided looking at me, too. Rather to my surprise, he was an Indianâ€”not Cherokee; perhaps a Tuscarora? I hadnâ€™t expected that from his speech, nor his curly hair. Clearly he was mixed-blood, too.

The rest of the gang were more or less white, but a motley crew, nonetheless. Three of them were no more than half-bearded boys in their mid-teens, scruffy and gangling. They did look at me, goggling drop-jawed, and nudging one another. I stared at one of them until he met my eye; he went bright scarlet beneath his sparse whiskers, and looked away.

Fortunately, the shift I was wearing was one with sleeves; the thing covered me decently enough from drawstring neck to the hem at mid-calf, but there was no denying that I felt uncomfortably exposed. The shift was damp and clung limply to the curve of my breastsâ€”a sensation I was uncomfortably aware of. I wished I had kept hold of the blanket.

The men swirled slowly round me, loading the horses, and I had the distinct and unpleasant sense of being the center of the massâ€”in much the same way a bullâ€™s-eye lies at the center of a target. I could only hope that I looked aged and cronelike enough for my state of untidiness to be repellent, rather than interesting; my hair was loose, wild, and tangled as witchâ€™s moss around my shoulders, and I certainly felt as though I had been crumpled up like an old paper bag.

I held myself bolt upright in the saddle, giving an unfriendly glare to anyone who so much as glanced in my direction. One man blinked blearily at my bare leg with a faint look of speculationâ€”only to recoil noticeably when he met my eye.

That gave me a momentary feeling of grim satisfactionâ€”superseded almost immediately by shock. The horses had begun to move, and as mine obediently followed the man in front of me, two more men came into view, standing under a big oak. I knew them both.

Harley Boble was tying the strings on a packsaddle, scowling as he said something to another, larger man. Harley Boble was an erstwhile thieftaker, now evidently turned thief. A thoroughly nasty little man, he was unlikely to be well-disposed toward me, owing to an occurrence at a Gathering some time before.

I wasnâ€™t at all pleased to see him here, though I was by no means surprised to find him in such company. But it was the sight of his companion that caused my empty stomach to contract, and my skin to twitch like a horse with flies.

Mr. Lionel Brown, of Brownsville.

He looked up, caught sight of me, and turned hastily away again, shoulders hunching. He must have realized that I had seen him, though, for he turned back to face me, thin features set in a sort of weary defiance. His nose was swollen and discolored, a dark red bulb visible even in the grayish light. He stared at me for a moment, then nodded as though making some reluctant acknowledgment, and turned away again.

I risked a glance back over my shoulder as we entered the trees, but couldnâ€™t see him anymore. What was he doing here? I hadnâ€™t recognized his voice at the time, but clearly it had been he who had argued with Hodgepile about the wisdom of taking me. Little wonder! He wasnâ€™t the only one disturbed by our mutual recognition.

Lionel Brown and his brother, Richard, were traders; the founders and patriarchs of Brownsville, a tiny settlement in the hills some forty miles from the Ridge. It was one thing for freebooters like Boble or Hodgepile to roam the countryside, robbing and burning; quite another for the Browns of Brownsville to be providing a base for their depredations. The very last thing in the world Mr. Lionel Brown could wish would be for me to reach Jamie with word of what he had been up to.

And I rather thought he would take steps to prevent me doing so. The sun was coming up, beginning to warm the air, but I felt suddenly cold, as though I had been dropped in a well.

Rays of light shone through the branches, gilding the remnants of the night mist that veiled the trees and silvering the dripping edges of their leaves. The trees were alive with birdsong, and a towhee hopped and scratched in a patch of sun, oblivious of the passing men and horses. It was too early yet for flies and mosquitoes, and the soft morning breeze caressed my face. Definitely one of those prospects where only man was vile.

The morning passed quietly enough, but I was aware of the constant state of tension among the menâ€”though no more tense than I was.

Jamie Fraser, where are you? I thought, concentrating fiercely on the forest around us. Every distant rustle or snap of twig might presage rescue, and my nerves began to be distinctly frayed in anticipation.

Where? When? How? I had neither reins nor weapons; ifâ€”whenâ€”an attack was made on the group, my bestâ€”well, the only possibleâ€”strategy was to fling myself off the horse and run. As we rode I constantly evaluated each patch of witch-hazel and stand of spruce, spotting footholds, plotting a zigzag path through saplings and boulders.

It wasnâ€™t only an attack by Jamie and his men that I was preparing for; I couldnâ€™t see Lionel Brown, but I knew he was somewhere nearby. A spot between my shoulder blades clenched in a knot, anticipating a knife.

I kept an eye out for potential weapons: rocks of a useful size, branches that might be seized from the ground. If and when I ran, I meant to let no one stop me. But we pushed on, moving as quickly as the horsesâ€™ footing allowed, men glancing back constantly over their shoulders, hands on their guns. As for me, I was obliged to relinquish my imaginary grasp on each possible weapon in turn as it slid past, out of sight.

To my intense disappointment, we reached the gorge near midday, without incident.

I had visited the gorge once with Jamie. The cataract fell sixty feet down a granite cliff face, sparkling with rainbows and roaring with a voice like the archangel Michael. Fronds of red chokeberry and wild indigo fringed the falls, and yellow poplars overhung the river below the cataractâ€™s pool, so thick that no more than a fugitive gleam from the waterâ€™s surface showed between the banks of lush vegetation. Hodgepile, of course, had not been drawn by the scenic beauty of the spot.

â€œGet off.â€ A gruff voice spoke near my elbow, and I looked down to see Tebbe. â€œWe will swim the horses across. You come with me.â€

â€œIâ€™ll take her.â€ My heart sprang up into my throat at the sound of a thickly nasal voice. It was Lionel Brown, pushing his way past an overhanging rope of creeper, dark eyes intent on me.

â€œNot you.â€ Tebbe rounded on Brown, fist closed.

â€œNot you,â€ I repeated firmly. â€œIâ€™m going with him.â€ I slid off the horse and promptly took shelter behind the big mulattoâ€™s menacing frame, peering out at Brown from beneath the bigger manâ€™s arm.

I wasnâ€™t under the slightest illusion about Brownâ€™s intent. He wouldnâ€™t risk assassinating me under Hodgepileâ€™s eye, but he couldâ€”and wouldâ€”drown me easily, and claim it was an accident. The river was shallow here, but still fast; I could hear it whooshing past the rocks near shore.

Brownâ€™s eyes darted right, then left, thinking whether to try it onâ€”but Tebbe hunched his massive shoulders, and Brown gave it up as a bad job. He snorted, spat to one side, and stamped away, snapping branches.

I might never have a better chance. Not waiting for the sounds of Brownâ€™s huffy exit to subside, I slipped a hand over the big manâ€™s elbow and squeezed his arm.

â€œThank you,â€ I said, low-voiced. â€œFor what you did last night. Are you badly hurt?â€

He glanced down at me, apprehension clear in his face. My touching him plainly disconcerted him; I could feel the tension in his arm as he tried to decide whether to pull away from me or not.

â€œNo,â€ he said at last. â€œI am all right.â€ He hesitated a moment, but then smiled uncertainly.

It was obvious what Hodgepile intended; the horses were being led, one at a time, down a narrow deer trail that edged the escarpment. We were more than a mile from the cataract, but the air was still loud with its noise. The sides of the gorge plunged steeply down to the water, more than fifty feet below, and the opposite bank was equally steep and overgrown.

A thick fringe of bushes hid the edge of the bank, but I could see that the river spread out here, becoming slower as it shallowed. With no dangerous currents, the horses could be taken downstream, to come out at some random point on the opposite shore. Anyone who had succeeded in tracking us to the gorge would lose the trail here, and have no little difficulty in picking it up on the opposite side.

With an effort, I stopped myself looking back over my shoulder for signs of imminent pursuit. My heart was beating fast. If Jamie was nearby, he would wait and attack the group when they entered the water, when they were most vulnerable. Even if he were not yet near, it would be a confusing business, crossing the river. If there were ever a time to attempt an escape . . .

â€œYou shouldnâ€™t go with them,â€ I said conversationally to Tebbe. â€œYouâ€™ll die, too.â€

The arm under my hand jerked convulsively. He glanced down at me, wide-eyed. The sclera of his eyes were yellow with jaundice, and the irises broken, giving him an odd, smudgy stare.

â€œI told him the truth, you know.â€ I lifted my chin toward Hodgepile, visible in the distance. â€œHeâ€™ll die. So will all those with him. Thereâ€™s no need for you to die, though.â€

He muttered something under his breath, and pressed a fist against his chest. He had something on a string there, hanging beneath his shirt. I didnâ€™t know whether it might be a cross or some more pagan amulet, but he seemed to be responding well to suggestion so far.

So close to the river, the air was thick with moisture, live with the smell of green things and water.

â€œThe water is my friend,â€ I said, trying for an air of mystery suitable to a conjure woman. I was not a good liar, but I was lying for my life. â€œWhen we go into the river, let go your hold. A water horse will rise up to carry me away.â€

His eyes couldnâ€™t get any wider. Evidently, heâ€™d heard of kelpies, or something like them. Even this far from the cataract, the roar of the water had voices in itâ€”if one chose to listen.

â€œI am not going away with a water horse,â€ he said with conviction. â€œI know about them. They take you down, drown you, and eat you.â€

â€œIt wonâ€™t eat me,â€ I assured him. â€œYou neednâ€™t go near it. Just stand clear, once weâ€™re in the water. Keep well away.â€

And if he did, Iâ€™d be under the water and swimming for my life before he could say Jack Robinson. I would be willing to bet that most of Hodgepileâ€™s bandits couldnâ€™t swim; few people in the mountains could. I flexed my leg muscles, readying myself, aches and stiffness dissolved in a flood of adrenaline.

Half the men were over the edge with the horses alreadyâ€”I could delay Tebbe, I thought, until the rest were safely in the water. Even if he wouldnâ€™t deliberately connive at my escape, if I slipped his grasp, I thought he wouldnâ€™t try to catch me.

He pulled halfheartedly at my arm, and I stopped abruptly.

â€œOuch! Wait, Iâ€™ve stepped on a bur.â€

I lifted one foot, peering at the sole. Given the dirt and resin stains adhering to it, no one could possibly have told whether I had picked up cockleburs, bramble thorns, or even a horseshoe nail.

â€œWe need to go, woman.â€ I didnâ€™t know whether it was my proximity, the roar of the water, or the thought of water horses that was disturbing Tebbe, but he was sweating with nerves; his odor had changed from simple musk to something sharp and pungent.

â€œJust a moment,â€ I said, pretending to pick at my foot. â€œNearly got it.â€

â€œLeave it. I will carry you.â€

Tebbe was breathing heavily, looking back and forth from me to the edge of the gorge, where the deer trail disappeared into the growth, as though fearing the reappearance of Hodgepile.

It wasnâ€™t Hodgepile who popped out of the bushes, though. It was Lionel Brown, his face set with purpose, two younger men behind him, looking equally determined.

â€œIâ€™ll take her,â€ he said without preamble, grabbing my arm.

â€œNo!â€ By reflex, Tebbe clutched my other arm and pulled.

An undignified tug-of-war ensued, with Tebbe and Mr. Brown each jerking one of my arms. Before I could be split like a wishbone, Tebbe fortunately changed tactics. Releasing my arm, he seized me instead about the body and clutched me to himself, kicking out with one foot at Mr. Brown.

The result of this maneuver was to cause Tebbe and myself to fall backward into an untidy pile of arms and legs, while Brown also lost his balance, though I didnâ€™t realize at first that he had. All I was aware of was a loud yell and stumbling noises, followed by a crash and the rattle of dislodged stones bounding down a rocky slope.

Disengaging myself from Tebbe, I crawled out, to discover the rest of the men grouped round an ominously flattened spot in the bushes fringing the gorge. One or two were hurriedly fetching ropes and yelling contradictory orders, from which I deduced that Mr. Brown had indeed fallen into the gorge, but was not yet certifiably dead.

I rapidly reversed directions, meaning to dive headfirst into the vegetation, but came up instead against a pair of cracked boots, belonging to Hodgepile. He seized me by the hair and yanked, causing me to shriek and lash out at him in reflex. I caught him across the midriff. He oomphed and went open-mouthed, gasping for air, but didnâ€™t let go his iron grip on my hair.

Making furious faces in my direction, he let go then, and boosted me toward the edge of the gorge with a knee. One of the younger men was clinging to the bushes, feeling gingerly for footholds on the slope below, one rope tied round his waist and another slung in a coil over his shoulder.

â€œFrigging mort!â€ Hodgepile yelled, digging his fingers into my arm as he leaned through the broken bushes. â€œWhat dâ€™ye mean by this, you bitch?â€

He capered on the edge of the gorge like Rumpelstiltskin, shaking his fist and hurling abuse impartially at his damaged business partner and at me, while the rescue operations commenced. Tebbe had withdrawn to a safe distance, where he stood looking offended.

At length, Brown was hauled up, groaning loudly, and laid out on the grass. Those men not already in the river gathered round, looking hot and flustered.

â€œYou mean to mend him, conjure woman?â€ Tebbe asked, glancing skeptically at me. I didnâ€™t know whether he meant to cast doubt upon my abilities, or only on the wisdom of my helping Brown, but I nodded, a little uncertainly, and came forward.

â€œI suppose so.â€ An oath was an oath, though I rather wondered if Hippocrates ever ran into this sort of situation himself. Possibly he did; the ancient Greeks were a violent lot, too.

The men gave way to me easily enough; once having got Brown out of the gorge, it was obvious that they had no notion what to do about him.

I did a hasty triage. Aside from multiple cuts, contusions, and a thick coating of dust and mud, Mr. Lionel Brown had fractured his left leg in at least two places, broken his left wrist, and probably crushed a couple of ribs. Only one of the leg fractures was compound, but it was nasty, the jagged end of the broken thighbone poking through skin and breeches, surrounded by a steadily widening patch of red.

He had unfortunately not severed his femoral artery, since if he had, he would have been dead already. Still, Mr. Brown had probably ceased to be a personal threat to me for the moment, which was all to the good.

Lacking any equipment or medication, bar several filthy neckcloths, a pine branch, and some whisky from a canteen, my ministrations were necessarily limited. I managedâ€”with no little difficulty and quite a lot of whiskyâ€”to get the femur roughly straightened and splinted without having Brown die of shock, which I thought no small accomplishment under the circumstances.

It was a difficult job, though, and I was muttering to myself under my breathâ€”something I hadnâ€™t realized I was doing, until I glanced up to find Tebbe crouched on his heels on the other side of Brownâ€™s body, regarding me with interest.

â€œOh, you curse him,â€ he said approvingly. â€œYes, that is a good idea.â€

Mr. Brownâ€™s eyes sprang open and bugged out. He was half off his head with pain, and thoroughly drunk by now, but not quite so drunk as to overlook this.

â€œMake her stop,â€ he said hoarsely. â€œHere, Hodgepileâ€”make her stop! Make her take it back!â€

â€œâ€˜Ere, whatâ€™s this? What did you say, woman?â€ Hodgepile had simmered down a bit, but his animus was instantly rekindled by this. He reached down and grabbed my wrist just as I was feeling my way over Brownâ€™s injured torso. It was the wrist he had twisted so viciously the day before, and a stab of pain shot up my forearm.

â€œIf you must know, I expect I said â€˜Jesus H. Roosevelt Christâ€™!â€ I snapped. â€œLet go of me!â€

â€œThatâ€™s what she said when she cursed you! Get her away from me! Donâ€™t let her touch me!â€ Panicked, Brown made to squirm away from me, a very bad idea for a man with freshly broken bones. He went dead-white under the smears of mud, and his eyes rolled back in his head.

â€œLook at that! Heâ€™s dead!â€ one of the onlookers exclaimed. â€œSheâ€™s done it! She witched him!â€

This caused no little uproar, between the vocal approbation of Tebbe and his supporters, my own protests, and outcries of concern from Mr. Brownâ€™s friends and relations, one of whom squatted down by the body, putting an ear to the chest.

â€œHeâ€™s alive!â€ this man exclaimed. â€œUncle Lionel! You all right?â€

Lionel Brown groaned loudly and opened his eyes, causing further commotion. The young man who had called him Uncle drew a large knife from his belt and pointed it at me. His eyes were open so wide that the whites showed all around.

â€œYou get back!â€ he said. â€œDonâ€™t you touch him!â€

I raised my hands, palms out, in gesture of abnegation.

â€œFine!â€ I snapped. â€œI wonâ€™t!â€ There was, in fact, little more I could do for Brown. He should be kept warm, dry, and well-hydrated, but something told me that Hodgepile would not be open to any such suggestions.

He wasnâ€™t. By means of furious and repeated bellows, he quelled the incipient riot, then declared that we were crossing the gorge, and right quickly, too.

â€œPut â€™im on a stretcher, then,â€ he said impatiently, in reply to protests from Brownâ€™s nephew. â€œAnd as for youâ€”â€ He rounded on me, glaring. â€œDid I tell you? No tricks, I said!â€

â€œKill her,â€ Brown said hoarsely from the ground. â€œKill her now.â€

â€œKill her? Not bloody likely, oulâ€™ son.â€ Hodgepileâ€™s eyes gleamed with malice. â€œSheâ€™s no more risk to me alive than deadâ€”and a good bit more profit alive. But Iâ€™ll keep her in line.â€

The knife was never far from his grasp. He had it out in an instant, and had seized my hand. Before I could so much as draw breath, I felt the blade press down, cutting partway into the base of my forefinger.

â€œRemember what I told you, do you?â€ He breathed it, his face was soft with anticipation. â€œI donâ€™t need you whole.â€

I did remember, and my belly hollowed, my throat dried to silence. My skin burned where he cut, and pain spread in a flash through my nerves; the need to jerk away from the blade was so strong that the muscles of my arm cramped with it.

I could imagine vividly the spurting stump, the shock of broken bone, ripped flesh, the horror of irrevocable loss.

But behind Hodgepile, Tebbe had risen to his feet. His odd, smudgy stare was fixed on me, with an expression of fascinated dread. I saw his hand close in a fist, his throat move as he swallowed, and felt the saliva return to my own. If I was to keep his protection, I must keep his belief.

I fixed my eyes on Hodgepileâ€™s, and made myself lean toward him. My skin quivered and jumped, and the blood roared louder in my ears than the voice of the cataractâ€”but I opened my eyes wide. A witchâ€™s eyesâ€”or so some said.

Very, very slowly, I lifted my free hand, still wet with Brownâ€™s blood. I reached the bloody fingers toward Hodgepileâ€™s face.

â€œI remember,â€ I said, my voice a hoarse whisper. â€œDo you remember what I said?â€

He would have done it. I saw the decision flash in his eyes, but before he could press the knife blade down, the bushy-haired young Indian leaped forward, grabbing at his arm with a cry of horror. Distracted, Hodgepile let go his grip, and I pulled free.

In an instant, Tebbe and two more men surged forward, hands on knives and pistol grips.

Hodgepileâ€™s thin face was pinched with fury, but the moment of incipient violence had passed. He lowered his own knife, the menace receding.

I opened my mouth to say something that might help defuse the situation further, but was forestalled by a panicked cry from Brownâ€™s nephew.

â€œDonâ€™t let her talk! Sheâ€™ll curse us all!â€

â€œOh, bleedinâ€™ â€™ell,â€ said Hodgepile, fury transmuted to mere crossness.

I had used several neckcloths to bind Brownâ€™s splint. Hodgepile stooped and snatched one from the ground, wadded it into a ball, and stepped forward.

â€œOpen your mouth,â€ he said tersely, and seizing my jaw with one hand, he forced open my mouth and crammed the wadded fabric into it. He glared at Tebbe, who had made a jerky move forward.

â€œI shanâ€™t kill her. But she says not a word more. Not to â€™imâ€â€”he nodded at Brown, then Tebbeâ€”â€œnot to you. Nor me.â€ He glanced back at me, and to my surprise, I saw a lurking uneasiness in his eyes. â€œNot to anyone.â€

Tebbe looked uncertain, but Hodgepile was already tying his own neckcloth round my head, effectively gagging me.

â€œNot a word,â€ Hodgepile repeated, glaring round at the company. â€œNow, letâ€™s go!â€



WE CROSSED THE river. To my surprise, Lionel Brown survived, but it was a lengthy business, and the sun was low by the time we made camp, two miles past the gorge on the farther side.

Everyone was wet, and a fire was kindled without discussion. The currents of dissension and distrust were still there, but had been damped by the river and exhaustion. Everyone was simply too tired for further strife.

They had tied my hands loosely, but left my feet unbound; I made my way to a fallen log near the fire and sank down, utterly drained. I was damp and chilled, my muscles trembling with exhaustionâ€”I had been forced to walk from the riverâ€”and for the first time, I began to wonder whether Jamie would in fact find me. Ever.

Perhaps he had followed the wrong group of bandits. Perhaps he had found and attacked themâ€”and been wounded or killed in the fight. I had closed my eyes, but opened them again, seeking to avoid the visions this thought had conjured up. I still worried about Marsaliâ€”but either they had found her in time or they hadnâ€™t; either way, her fate had been decided.

The fire was burning well, at least; cold, wet, and eager for hot food, the men had brought an immense pile of wood. A short, silent black man was stoking the fire, while a couple of the teenagers rifled the packs for food. A pot of water was set on the fire with a chunk of salt beef, and the lion-haired young Indian poured cornmeal into a bowl with a lump of lard.

Another bit of lard sizzled on an iron girdle, melting into grease. It smelled wonderful.

Saliva flooded my mouth, absorbed at once into the wad of fabric, and despite discomfort, the smell of food bolstered my spirits a little. My stays, loosened by the travel of the last twenty-four hours, had tightened again as the wet laces dried and shrank. My skin itched beneath the fabric, but the thin ribs of the boning did give me a sense of support, more than welcome at the moment.

Mr. Brownâ€™s two nephewsâ€”Aaron and Moses, I had learnedâ€”limped slowly into camp, a makeshift stretcher sagging between them. They set it gratefully down beside the fire, evoking a loud yell from the contents.

Mr. Brown had survived the river crossing, but it hadnâ€™t done him any good. Of course, I had told them he should be kept well-hydrated. The thought undid me, tired as I was, and I made a muffled snorting sound behind my gag.

One of the young lads nearby heard me, and reached tentatively for the knot of my gag, but dropped his hand at once when Hodgepile barked at him.

â€œLeave her!â€

â€œButâ€”donâ€™t she need to eat, Hodge?â€ The boy glanced uneasily at me.

â€œNot just yet she doesnâ€™t.â€ Hodgepile squatted down in front of me, looking me over. â€œLearned your lesson yet, â€™ave you?â€

I didnâ€™t move. Just sat and looked at him, infusing my gaze with as much scorn as possible. The cut on my finger burned; my palms had begun to sweatâ€”but I stared. He tried to stare back, but couldnâ€™t do itâ€”his eyes kept slipping away.

That made him even angrier; a flush burned high on his bony cheeks.

â€œStop looking at me!â€

I blinked slowly, once, and kept looking, with what I hoped appeared to be interested dispassion. He was looking rather strained, our Mr. Hodgepile was. Dark circles under the eyes, muscle fibers bracketing his mouth like lines carved in wood. Sweat stains wet and hot beneath the armpits. Constant browbeating must take it out of one.

All at once, he stood up, grabbed me by the arm, and yanked me to my feet.

â€œIâ€™ll put you where you canâ€™t stare, bitch,â€ he muttered, and marched me past the fire, shoving me ahead of him. A little way outside the camp, he found a tree to his liking. He untied my hands and rebound my wrists, with a loop of line wrapped round my waist and my hands fastened to it. Then he pushed me down into a seated position, fashioned a crude noose with a slipknot, and put it round my neck, tying the free end to the tree.

â€œSo as you wonâ€™t wander away,â€ he said, pulling the rough hemp snug around my neck. â€œShouldnâ€™t want you to get lost. Might be eaten by a bear, and then what, eh?â€ This had quite restored his humor; he laughed immoderately, and was still chuckling when he left. He turned, though, to glance back at me. I sat upright, staring, and the humor abruptly left his face. He turned and strode off, shoulders stiff as wood.

In spite of hunger, thirst, and general discomfort, I actually felt a sense of profound, if momentary, relief. If I was not strictly speaking alone, I was at least unobserved, and even this modicum of privacy was balm.

I was a good twenty yards from the fire ring, out of sight of all the men. I sagged against the tree trunk, the muscles of face and body giving way all at once, and a shiver seized me, though it wasnâ€™t cold.

Soon. Surely Jamie would find me soon. Unlessâ€”I pushed the dubious thought aside as though it were a venomous scorpion. Likewise any thought of what had happened to Marsali, or might happen if and whenâ€”no, whenâ€”he did find us. I didnâ€™t know how heâ€™d manage, but he would. He just would.

The sun was nearly down; shadows were pooling under the trees and the light faded slowly from the air, making colors fugitive and solid objects lose their depth. There was rushing water somewhere nearby, and the calling of the occasional bird in the distant trees. These began to fall silent as the evening cooled, replaced by the rising chirp of crickets near at hand. My eye caught the flicker of movement, and I saw a rabbit, gray as the dusk, sitting up on its hind legs under a bush a few feet distant, nose twitching.

The sheer normalcy of it all made my eyes sting. I blinked away the tears, and the rabbit was gone.

The sight of it had restored my nerve a little; I essayed a few experiments, to see the limits of my present bondage. My legs were freeâ€”that was good. I could rise up into a sort of ungainly squat, and duck-waddle round the tree. Even better; I would be able to relieve myself in privacy on the far side.

I could not, however, rise entirely to my feet, nor could I reach the knot of the line that circled the tree trunk; the rope either slid or caught on the bark, but in either case, the knot remained frustratingly on the opposite side of the trunkâ€”which had to measure nearly three feet in diameter.

I had about two feet of line between the trunk and the noose about my neck; enough to allow me to lie down, or to turn from side to side. Hodgepile was rather obviously well-acquainted with convenient methods of restraining captives; I thought of the Oâ€™Briansâ€™ homestead, and the two bodies there. The two elder children missing. A small shudder passed over me again.

Where were they? Sold to one of the Indian tribes as slaves? Taken to a sailorsâ€™ brothel in one of the coastal towns? Or onto a ship, to be pressed into use on the sugar plantations of the Indies?

I was under no illusions that any of these picturesquely unpleasant fates lay in store for me. I was much too old, much too obstreperousâ€”and much too notorious. No, the only value I held for Hodgepile was my knowledge of the whisky cache. Once he had got within sniffing distance of that, he would slit my throat without a momentâ€™s compunction.

The smell of roasting meat floated through the air, flooding my mouth with fresh salivaâ€”a welcome relief, in spite of the growling of my stomach, since the gag dried my mouth unpleasantly.

A tiny jolt of panic tensed my muscles. I didnâ€™t want to think about the gag. Or the ropes around my wrists and neck. It would be too easy to succumb to the panic of confinement, and exhaust myself in futile struggle. I had to preserve my strength; I didnâ€™t know when or how I would need it, but need it I surely would. Soon, I prayed. Let it be soon.

The men had settled to their supper, the contentions of the day sunk in appetite. They were far enough away that I couldnâ€™t hear the particulars of their conversation, but only the stray word or phrase borne on the evening breeze. I turned my head to let the breeze smooth the hair from my face, and found that I could see a long, narrow swath of sky above the distant gorge, gone a deep, unearthly blue, as though the fragile layer of atmosphere that covered the earth grew thinner still, and the darkness of space beyond shone through.

The stars began to prick out, one by one, and I managed to lose myself in watching, counting them as they appeared, one by one by one . . . touching them as I might the beads of a rosary, and saying to myself such astronomical names as I knew, comforting in their sound, even though I had no idea whether such names bore any relation to the celestial bodies I saw. Alpha Centauri, Deneb, Sirius, Betelgeuse, the Pleiades, Orion . . .

I succeeded in soothing myself to the extent that I dozed off, only to rouse some time later to find it now full dark. The light of the fire sent a flickering glow through the underbrush, painting my feet, which lay in an open spot, with rosy shadows. I stirred and stretched myself as well as I could, trying to relieve the stiffness in my back, and wondered whether Hodgepile thought himself safe now, to be allowing such a large fire?

A loud groan came to me on the windâ€”Lionel Brown. I grimaced, but there was nothing I could do for him in my present condition.

I heard shuffling and a murmur of voices; someone was attending to him.

â€œ. . . hot as a pistol . . .â€ one voice said, sounding only mildly concerned.

â€œ. . . fetch the woman? . . .â€

â€œNo,â€ said a definite voice. Hodgepile. I sighed.

â€œ. . . water. No help for that . . .â€

I was listening so intently, in hopes of hearing what was happening by the fire, that it was some time before I became aware of noises in the brush nearby. Not animals; only bears would make that much noise, and bears didnâ€™t giggle. The giggling was subdued, not only muffled but repeatedly interrupted.

There was whispering, too, though I couldnâ€™t make out most of the words. The overall atmosphere was so much one of excited juvenile conspiracy, though, that I knew it must be some of the younger members of the gang.

â€œ. . . go on, then!â€ I caught, spoken in a vehement tone, and accompanied by a crashing noise, indicating that someone had been pushed into a tree. Another crash, indicating retaliation.

More rustling. Whisper, whisper, snigger, snort. I sat up straight, wondering what in Godâ€™s name they were up to.

Then I heard, â€œHer legs arenâ€™t tied . . .â€ and my heart gave a small jump.

â€œBut what if she . . .â€ mumble, mumble.

â€œWonâ€™t matter. She canâ€™t scream.â€

That came through very clearly, and I jerked my feet back to scramble upâ€”only to be brought up short by the noose around my neck. It felt like an iron bar across my windpipe, and I fell back, seeing blood-red blotches at the corners of my eyes.

I shook my head and gulped air, trying to shake off the dizziness, adrenaline racing through my blood. I felt a hand on my ankle, and kicked out sharply.

â€œHey!â€ he said out loud, sounding surprised. He took his hand off my ankle and sat back a little. My vision was clearing; I could see him now, but the firelight was behind him; it was one of the young lads, but no more than a faceless, hunched silhouette in front of me.

â€œShh,â€ he said, and giggled nervously, reaching out a hand toward me. I made a deep growling noise behind my gag, and he stopped, frozen in mid-reach. There was a rustling in the brush behind him.

This seemed to remind him that his friendâ€”or friendsâ€”were watching, and he reached out with renewed resolution, patting me on the thigh.

â€œDonâ€™t you worry, maâ€™am,â€ he whispered, duck-walking closer on his heels, â€œI donâ€™t mean you no harm.â€

I snorted, and he hesitated againâ€”but then another rustle from the bush seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he grasped me by the shoulders, trying to make me lie down. I struggled hard, kicking and kneeing at him, and he lost his grip, lost his balance, and fell on his backside.

A muffled explosion of sniggering from the bush brought him up on his feet like a jack-in-the-box. He reached down with decision, seized my ankles, and yanked, jerking me flat. Then he flung himself on top of me, pinning me with his weight.

â€œHush!â€ he said urgently into my ear. His hands were grappling for my throat, and I squirmed and thrashed under his weight, trying to buck him off. His hands closed tight on my neck, though, and I stopped, my vision going black and bloody once again.

â€œHush, now,â€ he said more quietly. â€œYou just hush, maâ€™am, all right?â€ I was making small choking noises, which he must have taken for assent, for his grip slackened.

â€œI ainâ€™t gonna hurt you, maâ€™am, I really ainâ€™t,â€ he whispered, trying to hold me down with one hand while fumbling about between us with the other. â€œWould you just be still, please?â€

I wouldnâ€™t, and he finally put a forearm across my throat and leaned on it. Not hard enough to make me black out again, but hard enough to take some of the fight out of me. He was thin and wiry, but very strong, and by dint of simple determination, succeeded in pushing up my shift and wedging his knee between my thighs.

He was breathing nearly as hard as I was, and I could smell the goaty reek of his excitement. His hands had left my throat, and were feverishly grasping at my breasts, in a manner that made it reasonably clear that the only other breast heâ€™d ever touched was likely his motherâ€™s.

â€œHush, now, donâ€™t you be scared, maâ€™am, itâ€™s all right, I ainâ€™t . . . oh. Oh, my. I . . . uh . . . oh.â€ His hand was poking about between my thighs, then left off momentarily as he raised himself briefly and wriggled down his breeches.

He collapsed heavily on top of me, hips pumping frantically as he thrust madly awayâ€”making no contact save that of friction, as he very obviously had no idea of the way in which female anatomy was constructed. I lay still, astonished into immobility, then felt a warm pulse of liquid under my thighs as he lost himself in panting ecstasy.

All the wiry tension went out of him in a rush, and he subsided on my chest like a limp balloon. I could feel his young heart pounding like a steam hammer, and his temple was pressed against my cheek, damp with sweat.

I found the intimacy of this contact quite as objectionable as the softening presence wedged between my thighs, and rolled abruptly to the side, dumping him off. He came to life suddenly, and scrambled to his knees, yanking at his drooping breeches.

He swayed to and fro for a moment, then dropped to his hands and knees and crawled up close beside me.

â€œIâ€™m really sorry, maâ€™am,â€ he whispered.

I made no move, and after a moment, he reached out a tentative hand and patted me gently on the shoulder.

â€œIâ€™m real sorry,â€ he repeated, still whispering, and then was gone, leaving me lying on my back in a puddle, wondering whether such an incompetent assault could legitimately be termed rape.

Distant rustling in the bushes, accompanied by muffled whoops of young male delight, decided me firmly that it could. Christ, the rest of the obnoxious little beasts would be at me in no time. Panicked, I sat up, mindful of the noose.

The glow from the fire was irregular and flickering, barely enough to make out the trunks of trees and the pale layer of needles and leaf mold on the ground. Enough to see the protrusions of granite boulders through the leaf layer, and the occasional hump of a fallen twig. Not that the lack of potential weapons mattered, given that my hands were still firmly tied.

The weight of the young assailant had made things worse; the knots had pulled tighter during my struggles, and my hands throbbed with lack of circulation. My fingers were beginning to go numb at the tips. Bloody hell. Was I about to lose several fingers to gangrene, as a result of this absurdity?

For an instant, I contemplated the wisdom of behaving compliantly with the next horrible little boy, in hopes that he would remove the gag. If he would, I could at least beg him to loosen the ropesâ€”and then scream for help, in hopes that Tebbe would come and stop further assault, out of fear of my eventual supernatural revenge.

Here he came, a stealthy rustling in the bushes. I gritted my teeth on the gag and looked up, but the shadowy form in front of me wasnâ€™t one of the young boys.

The only thought that came to mind when I realized who the new visitor was was, Jamie Fraser, you bastard, where are you?

I froze, as though not moving might somehow render me invisible. The man moved in front of me, squatting down so as to look into my face.

â€œNot laughinâ€™ so much now, are you?â€ he said conversationally. It was Boble, the erstwhile thieftaker. â€œYou and your husband thought it was damn funny, didnâ€™t you, what them German women did to me? And then Mr. Fraser tellinâ€™ me as they meant to make sausage meat of me, and him with a face like a Christian readinâ€™ the Bible. Thought that was funny, too, didnâ€™t you?â€

To be perfectly honest, it had been funny. He was quite correct, though; I wasnâ€™t laughing now. He drew back his arm and slapped me.

The blow made my eyes water, but the fire lit him from the side; I could still see the smile on his pudgy face. A cold qualm ran through me, making me shudder. He saw that, and the smile broadened. His canine teeth were short and blunt, so the incisors stood out by contrast, long and yellowed, rodentlike.

â€œReckon youâ€™ll think this is even funnier,â€ he said, rising to his feet and reaching for his flies. â€œHope Hodge donâ€™t kill you right away, so you get to tell your husband about it. Bet you heâ€™ll enjoy the joke, man with a sense of humor like heâ€™s got.â€

The boyâ€™s semen was still damp and sticky on my thighs. I jerked back by reflex, trying to scramble to my feet, but was brought up short by the noose round my neck. My vision went dark for an instant as the rope tightened on my carotids, then cleared, and I found Bobleâ€™s face inches from mine, his breath hot on my skin.

He seized my chin in his hand and rubbed his face over mine, biting at my lips and rasping the stubble of his beard hard across my cheeks. Then he drew back, leaving my face wet with his saliva, pushed me flat, and climbed on top of me.

I could feel the violence in him, pulsing like an exposed heart, thin-walled and ready to burst. I knew I couldnâ€™t escape or prevent himâ€”knew he would hurt me, given the slightest excuse. The only thing to do was be still and endure him.

I couldnâ€™t. I heaved under him and rolled to the side, bringing up my knee as he pushed my shift aside. It hit him a glancing blow in the thigh, and he drew back his fist by reflex and punched me in the face, sharp and quick.

Red-black pain bloomed sudden from the center of my face, filled my head, and I went blind, shocked into momentary immobility. You utter fool, I thought, with total clarity. Now heâ€™ll kill you. The second blow struck my cheek and snapped my head to the side. Perhaps I moved again in blind resistance, perhaps I didnâ€™t.

Suddenly he was kneeling astride me, punching and slapping, blows dull and heavy as the thump of ocean waves on sand, too remote as yet for pain. I twisted, curling, bringing up my shoulder and trying to shield my face against the ground, and then his weight was gone.

He was standing. He was kicking me and cursing, panting and half-sobbing as his boot thudded into sides and back and thighs and buttocks. I panted in short gasps, trying to breathe. My body jerked and quivered with each blow, skidding on the leaf-strewn ground, and I clung to the sense of the ground below me, trying so hard to sink down, be swallowed by the earth.

Then it stopped. I could hear him panting, trying to speak. â€œGoddamn . . . goddamn . . . oh, goddamn . . . frig . . . frigginâ€™ . . . bitch. . .â€

I lay inert, trying to disappear into the darkness that enveloped me, knowing that he was going to kick me in the head. I could feel my teeth shatter, the fragile bones of my skull splinter and collapse into the wet soft pulp of my brain, and I trembled, clenching my teeth in futile resistance against the impact. It would sound like a melon being smashed, dull, sticky-hollow. Would I hear it?

It didnâ€™t come. There was another sound, a fast, hard rustling that made no sense. A faintly meaty sound, flesh on flesh in a soft smacking rhythm, and then he gave a groan and warm gouts of fluid fell wet on my face and shoulders, splattering on bare skin where the cloth of my shift had torn away.

I was frozen. Somewhere in the back of my mind, the detached observer wondered aloud whether this was in fact the single most disgusting thing I had ever encountered. Well, no, it wasnâ€™t. Some of the things I had seen at Lâ€™HÃ´pital des Anges, to say nothing of Father Alexandreâ€™s death, or the Beardsleysâ€™ attic . . . the field hospital at Amiens . . . heavens, no, this wasnâ€™t even close.

I lay rigid, eyes shut, recalling various nasty experiences of my past and wishing I were in fact in attendance at one of those events, instead of here.

He leaned over, seized my hair, and banged my head several times against the tree, wheezing as he did so.

â€œShow you . . .â€ he muttered, then dropped his hand and I heard shuffling noises as he staggered away.

When I finally opened my eyes again, I was alone.



I REMAINED ALONE, a small mercy. Bobleâ€™s violent attack seemed to have frightened away the boys.

I rolled onto my side and lay still, breathing. I felt very tired, and utterly forlorn.

Jamie, I thought, where are you?

I wasnâ€™t afraid of what might happen next; I couldnâ€™t see any further than the moment I was in, a single breath, a single heartbeat. I didnâ€™t think, and wouldnâ€™t feel. Not yet. I just lay still, and breathed.

Very slowly I began to notice small things. A fragment of bark caught in my hair, scratchy on my cheek. The give of the thick dead leaves beneath me, cradling my body. The sense of effort as my chest lifted. Increasing effort.

A tiny nerve began to twitch near one eye.

I realized quite suddenly that with the gag in my mouth and my nasal tissues being rapidly congested by blood and swelling, I was in some actual danger of suffocation. I twisted as far onto my side as I could get without strangling, and rubbed my face first against the ground, thenâ€”with increasing desperationâ€”dug my heels into the ground and wriggled upward, scraping my face hard against the bark of the tree, trying without success to loosen or dislodge the gag.

The bark rasped lip and cheek, but the kerchief tied round my head was so tight that it cut hard into the corners of my mouth, forcing it open so that saliva leaked constantly into the wad of fabric in my mouth. I gagged at the tickle of sodden cloth in my throat, and felt vomit burn the back of my nose.

You arenâ€™t, you arenâ€™t, you arenâ€™tyouarenâ€™tyou arenâ€™t going to vomit! I dragged air bubbling through my bloody nose, tasted thick copper as it slimed down my throat, gagged harder, doubled upâ€”and saw white light at the edge of vision, as the noose went tight around my throat.

I fell back, my head hitting hard against the tree. I hardly noticed; the noose loosened again, thank God, and I managed one, two, three precious breaths of blood-clogged air.

My nose was puffed from cheekbone to cheekbone, and swelling fast. I clenched my teeth on the gag and blew outward through my nose, trying to clear it, if only for a moment. Blood tinged with bile sprayed warm across my chin and splattered on my chestâ€”and I sucked air fast, getting a bit.

Blow, inhale. Blow, inhale. Blow . . . but my nasal passages were almost swollen shut by now, and I nearly sobbed in panic and frustration, as no air came.

Christ, donâ€™t cry! Youâ€™re dead if you cry, for Godâ€™s sake donâ€™t cry!

Blow . . . blow . . . I snorted with the last reserve of stale air in my lungs, and got a hair of clearance, enough to fill them once more.

I held my breath, trying to stay conscious long enough to discover a way to breatheâ€”there had to be a way to breathe.

I would not let a wretch like Harley Boble kill me by simple inadvertence. That wasnâ€™t right; it couldnâ€™t be.

I pressed myself, half-sitting, up against the tree to ease the strain on the noose around my neck as much as possible, and let my head fall forward, so that the blood from my nose ran down, dripping. That helped, a little. Not for long, though.

My eyelids began to feel tight; my nose was definitely broken, and the flesh all round the upper part of my face was puffing now, swelling with the blood and lymph of capillary trauma, squeezing my eyes shut, further constricting my thread of air.

I bit the gag in an agony of frustration, then, seized by desperation, began to chew at it, grinding the fabric between my teeth, trying to smash it down, compress it, shift it somehow inside my mouth. . . . I bit the inside of my cheek and felt the pain but didnâ€™t mind, it wasnâ€™t important, nothing mattered but breath, oh, God, I couldnâ€™t breathe, please help me breathe, please. . . .

I bit my tongue, gasped in painâ€”and realized that I had succeeded in thrusting my tongue past the gag, reaching the tip of it to the corner of my mouth. By poking as hard as I could with my tongue tip, I had made a tiny channel of air. No more than a wisp of oxygen could ooze through itâ€”but it was air, and that was all that mattered.

I had my head canted painfully to one side, forehead pressed against the tree, but was afraid to move at all, for fear of losing my slender lifeline of air, if the gag should shift when I moved my head. I sat still, hands clenched, drawing long, gurgling, horribly shallow breaths, and wondering how long I could stay this way; the muscles of my neck were already quivering from strain.

My hands were throbbing againâ€”they hadnâ€™t ever stopped, I supposed, but I hadnâ€™t had attention to spare for them. Now I did, and momentarily welcomed the shooting pains that outlined each nail with liquid fire, for distraction from the deadly stiffness spreading down my neck and through my shoulder.

The muscles of my neck jumped and spasmed; I gasped, lost my air, and arched my body bowlike, fingers dug into the binding ropes as I fought to get it back.

A hand came down on my arm. I hadnâ€™t heard him approach. I turned blindly, butting at him with my head. I didnâ€™t care who he was or what he wanted, provided he would remove the gag. Rape seemed a perfectly reasonable exchange for survival, at least at the moment.

I made desperate noises, whimpering, snorting, and spewing gouts of blood and snot as I shook my head violently, trying to indicate that I was chokingâ€”given the level of sexual incompetence so far demonstrated, he might not even realize that I couldnâ€™t breathe, and simply proceed about his business, unaware that simple rape was becoming necrophilia.

He was fumbling round my head. Thank God, thank God! I held myself still with superhuman effort, head swimming as little bursts of fire went off inside my eyeballs. Then the strip of fabric came away and I thrust the wad of cloth out of my mouth by reflex, instantly gagged, and threw up, whooping air and retching simultaneously.

I hadnâ€™t eaten; no more than a thread of bile seared my throat and ran down my chin. I choked and swallowed and breathed, sucking air in huge, greedy, lung-bursting gulps.

He was saying something, whispering urgently. I didnâ€™t care, couldnâ€™t listen. All I heard was the grateful wheeze of my own breathing, and the thump of my heart. Finally slowing from its frantic race to keep oxygen moving round my starved tissues, it pounded hard enough to shake my body.

Then a word or two got through to me, and I lifted my head, staring at him.

â€œWhad?â€ I said thickly. I coughed, shaking my head to try to clear it. It hurt very much. â€œWhat did you say?â€

He was visible only as a ragged, lion-haired silhouette, bony-shouldered in the faint glow from the fire.

â€œI said,â€ he whispered, leaning close, â€œdoes the name â€˜Ringo Starrâ€™ mean anything to you?â€



I WAS BY THIS TIME well beyond shock. I merely wiped my split lip gingerly on my shoulder, and said, very calmly, â€œYes.â€

He had been holding his breath; I realized it only when I heard the sigh as he released it, and saw his shoulders slump.

â€œOh, God,â€ he said, half under his breath. â€œOh, God.â€

He lunged forward suddenly and caught me against him in a hard embrace. I recoiled, choking as the noose round my neck tightened once again, but he didnâ€™t notice, absorbed in his own emotion.

â€œOh, God,â€ he said, and buried his face in my shoulder, nearly sobbing. â€œOh, God. I knew, I knew you hadda be, I knew it, but I couldnâ€™t believe it, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God! I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever find another one, not everâ€”â€

â€œKk,â€ I said. I arched my back, urgently.

â€œWhaâ€”oh, shit!â€ He let go and grabbed for the rope around my neck. He scrabbled hold of it and yanked the noose over my head, nearly tearing my ear off in the process, but I didnâ€™t mind. â€œShit, you okay?â€

â€œYes,â€ I croaked. â€œUn . . . tie me.â€

He sniffed, wiping his nose on his sleeve, and glanced back over his shoulder.

â€œI canâ€™t,â€ he whispered. â€œThe next guy who comes alongâ€™ll see.â€

â€œThe next guy?â€ I screamed, as well as I could scream in a strangled whisper. â€œWhat do you mean, the nextâ€”â€

â€œWell, you know. . . .â€ It seemed suddenly to dawn on him that I might have objections to waiting tamely like a trussed turkey for the next would-be rapist in the lineup. â€œEr . . . I mean . . . well, never mind. Who are you?â€

â€œYou know damn well who I am,â€ I croaked furiously, shoving him with my bound hands. â€œIâ€™m Claire Fraser. Who in bloody hell are you, what are you doing here, and if you want one more word out of me, youâ€™ll bloody well untie me this minute!â€

He turned again to glance apprehensively over his shoulder, and it occurred to me vaguely that he was afraid of his so-called comrades. So was I. I could see his profile in silhouette; it was indeed the bushy-haired young Indian, the one I had thought might be a Tuscaroran. Indian . . . some connection clicked into place, deep in the tangled synapses.

â€œBloody hell,â€ I said, and dabbed at a trickle of blood that ran from the raw corner of my mouth. â€œOtter-Toof. Tooth. Youâ€™re one of his.â€

â€œWhat?!â€ His head swung back to face me, eyes so wide the whites showed briefly. â€œWho?â€

â€œOh, what in hell was his real name? Robert . . . Robert th-something . . .â€ I was trembling with fury, terror, shock, and exhaustion, groping through the muddled remnants of what used to be my mind. Wreck though I might be, I remembered Otter-Tooth, all right. I had a sudden vivid memory of being alone in the dark, on a night like this, wet with rain and all alone, a long-buried skull cupped in my hands.

â€œSpringer,â€ he said, and gripped my arm eagerly. â€œSpringerâ€”was that it? Robert Springer?â€

I had just enough presence of mind to clamp my jaw, thrust out my chin, and hold up my bound hands in front of him. Not another word until he cut me loose.

â€œShit,â€ he muttered again, and with another hasty glance behind him, fumbled for his knife. He wasnâ€™t skillful with it. If I had needed any evidence that he wasnâ€™t a real Indian of the time . . . but he got my hands free without cutting me, and I doubled up with a groan, hands tucked under my armpits as the blood surged into them. They felt like balloons filled and stretched to the point of bursting.

â€œWhen?â€ he demanded, paying no attention to my distress. â€œWhen did you come? Where did you find Bob? Where is he?â€

â€œ1946,â€ I said, squeezing my arms down tight on my throbbing hands. â€œThe first time. 1968, the second. As for Mr. Springerâ€”â€

â€œThe secondâ€”did you say the second time?â€ His voice rose in astonishment. He choked it off, looking guiltily back, but the sounds of the men dicing and arguing round the fire were more than loud enough to drown out a simple exclamation.

â€œSecond time,â€ he repeated more softly. â€œSo you did it? You went back?â€

I nodded, pressing my lips together and rocking back and forth a little. I thought my fingernails would pop off with each heartbeat.

â€œWhat about you?â€ I asked, though I was fairly sure that I already knew.

â€œ1968,â€ he said, confirming it.

â€œWhat year did you turn up in?â€ I asked. â€œI meanâ€”how long have you been here? Er . . . now, I mean.â€

â€œOh, God.â€ He sat back on his heels, running a hand back through his long, tangled hair. â€œI been here six years, as near as I can tell. But you saidâ€”second time. If you made it home, why in hellâ€™d you come back? Ohâ€”wait. You didnâ€™t make it home, you went to another time, but not the one you came from? Whereâ€™d you start from?â€

â€œScotland, 1946. And no, I made it home,â€ I said, not wanting to go into details. â€œMy husband was here, though. I came back on purpose, to be with him.â€ A decision whose wisdom seemed presently in severe doubt.

â€œAnd speaking of my husband,â€ I added, beginning to feel as though I might possess a few shreds of sanity after all, â€œI was not joking. Heâ€™s coming. You donâ€™t want him to find you keeping me captive, I assure you. But if youâ€”â€

He disregarded this, leaning eagerly toward me.

â€œBut that means you know how it works! You can steer!â€

â€œSomething like that,â€ I said, impatient. â€œI take it that you and your companions didnâ€™t know how to steer, as you put it?â€ I massaged one hand with the other, gritting my teeth against the throb of blood. I could feel the furrows the rope had left in my flesh.

â€œWe thought we did.â€ Bitterness tinged his voice. â€œSinging stones. Gemstones. Thatâ€™s what we used. Raymond said . . . It didnâ€™t work, though. Or maybe . . . maybe it did.â€ He was making deductions; I could hear the excitement rising again in his tone.

â€œYou met Bob Springerâ€”Otter-Tooth, I mean. So he did make it! And if he made it, maybe the others did, too. See, I thought they were all dead. I thoughtâ€”thought I was alone.â€ There was a catch in his voice, and despite the urgency of the situation and my annoyance at him, I felt a pang of sympathy. I knew very well what it felt like to be alone in that way, marooned in time.

In a way, I hated to disillusion him, but there was no point in keeping the truth from him.

â€œOtter-Tooth is dead, Iâ€™m afraid.â€

He suddenly stopped moving and sat very still. The faint glow of firelight through the trees outlined him; I could see his face. A few long hairs lifted in the breeze. They were the only thing that moved.

â€œHow?â€ he said at last, in a small, choked voice.

â€œKilled by the Iroquois,â€ I said. â€œThe Mohawk.â€ My mind was beginning, very slowly, to work again. Six years ago, this manâ€”whoever he wasâ€”had come. 1767, that would be. And yet Otter-Tooth, the man who had once been Robert Springer, had died more than a generation earlier. Theyâ€™d started out together, but ended in different times.

â€œShit,â€ he said, though the obvious distress in his voice was mingled with something like awe. â€œThat would have been a real bummer, especially for Bob. He, like, idolized those guys.â€

â€œYes, I expect he was most put out about it,â€ I replied, rather dryly. My eyelids felt thick and heavy. It was an effort to force them open, but I could still see. I glanced at the fire glow, but couldnâ€™t see anything beyond the faint movement of shadows in the distance. If there actually was a lineup of men waiting for my services, at least they were tactfully keeping out of sight. I doubted it, and gave silent thanks that I wasnâ€™t twenty years youngerâ€”there might have been.

â€œI met some Iroquoisâ€”Christ, I went looking for â€™em, if you can believe that! That was the whole point, see, to find the Iroquois tribes and get them toâ€”â€

â€œYes, I know what you had in mind,â€ I interrupted. â€œLook, this is not really the time or place for a long discussion. I think thatâ€”â€

â€œThose Iroquois are some nasty tumblers, I tell you, man,â€ he said, jabbing me in the chest with a finger for emphasis. â€œYou wouldnâ€™t believe what they do toâ€”â€

â€œI know. So is my husband.â€ I gave him a glare, whichâ€”judging from the way he flinchedâ€”was probably rendered highly effective by the state of my face. I hoped so; it hurt a lot to do it.

â€œNow, what you want to do,â€ I said, mustering as much authority into my voice as I could, â€œis to go back to the fire, wait for a bit, then leave casually, sneak round, and get two horses. I hear a stream down thereâ€”â€ I waved briefly to the right. â€œIâ€™ll meet you there. Once weâ€™re safely away, Iâ€™ll tell you everything I know.â€

In fact, I probably couldnâ€™t tell him anything very helpful, but he didnâ€™t know that. I heard him swallow.

â€œI donâ€™t know . . .â€ he said uncertainly, glancing round again. â€œHodge, heâ€™s kind of gnarly. He shot one guy, a few days ago. Didnâ€™t even say anything, just walked up to him, pulled his gun, and boom!â€

â€œWhat for?â€

He shrugged, shaking his head.

â€œI donâ€™t even know, man. Just . . . boom, you know?â€

â€œI know,â€ I assured him, holding on to temper and sanity by a thread. â€œLook, letâ€™s not trouble with the horses, then. Letâ€™s just go.â€ I lurched awkwardly onto one knee, hoping that I would be able to rise in a few moments, let alone walk. The big muscles in my thighs were knotted hard in the spots where Boble had kicked me; trying to stand made the muscles jump and quiver in spasms that effectively hamstrung me.

â€œShit, not now!â€ In his agitation, the young man seized my arm and jerked me down beside him. I hit the ground hard on one hip and let out a cry of pain.

â€œYou all right there, Donner?â€ The voice came out of the darkness somewhere behind me. It was casualâ€”obviously one of the men had merely stepped out of camp to relieve himselfâ€”but the effect on the young Indian was galvanizing. He flung himself full-length upon me, banging my head on the ground and knocking all the breath out of me.

â€œFine . . . really . . . great,â€ he called to his companion, gasping in an exaggerated manner, evidently trying to sound like a man in the throes of half-completed lust. He sounded like someone dying of asthma, but I wasnâ€™t complaining. I couldnâ€™t.

Iâ€™d been knocked on the head a few times, and generally saw nothing but blackness as a result. This time I honestly did see colored stars, and lay limp and bemused, feeling as though I sat tranquilly some distance above my battered body. Then Donner laid a hand on my breast and I came instantly back to earth.

â€œLet go of me this instant!â€ I hissed. â€œWhat do you think youâ€™re doing?â€

â€œHey, hey, nothing, nothing, sorry,â€ he assured me hastily. He removed the hand, but didnâ€™t get off me. He squirmed a bit, and I realized that he was aroused by the contact, whether intended or not.

â€œGet off!â€ I said, in a furious whisper.

â€œHey, I donâ€™t mean anything, I mean I wouldnâ€™t hurt you or nothing. Itâ€™s just I havenâ€™t had a woman inâ€”â€

I grabbed a handful of his hair, lifted my head, and bit his ear, hard. He shrieked and rolled off me.

The other man had gone back toward the fire. At this, though, he turned and called back, â€œChrist, Donner, is she that good? Iâ€™ll have to give her a try!â€ This got a laugh from the men by the fire, but luckily it died away and they returned to their own concerns. I returned to mine, which was escape.

â€œYou didnâ€™t have to do that,â€ Donner whined in an undertone, holding his ear. â€œI wasnâ€™t going to do anything! Christ, you got nice tits, but youâ€™re like old enough to be my mother!â€

â€œShut up!â€ I said, pushing myself to a sitting position. The effort made my head spin; tiny colored lights flickered like Christmas-tree bulbs at the edge of my vision. In spite of this, some part of my mind was actively working again.

He was at least partly right. We couldnâ€™t leave immediately. After drawing so much attention to himself, the others would be expecting him to come back within a few minutes; if he didnâ€™t, theyâ€™d start looking for himâ€”and we needed more than a few minutesâ€™ start.

â€œWe canâ€™t go now,â€ he whispered, rubbing his ear reproachfully. â€œTheyâ€™ll notice. Wait â€™til they go to sleep. Iâ€™ll come get you then.â€

I hesitated. I was in mortal danger every moment that I spent within reach of Hodgepile and his feral gang. If I had needed any convincing, the encounters of the last two hours had demonstrated that. This Donner needed to go back to the fire and show himselfâ€”but I could steal away. Was it worth the risk that someone would come and find me gone, before I had got beyond pursuit? It would be more certain to wait until they slept. But did I dare wait that long?

And then there was Donner himself. If he wanted to talk to me, I certainly wanted to talk to him. The chance of stumbling on another time-traveler . . .

Donner read my hesitation, but misunderstood it.

â€œYouâ€™re not going without me!â€ He grabbed my wrist in sudden alarm, and before I could jerk away, had whipped a bit of the cut line around it. I fought and pulled away, hissing to try to make him understand, but he was panicked at the thought that I might slip away without him, and wouldnâ€™t listen. Hampered by my injuries, and unwilling to make enough noise to draw attention, I could only delay but not prevent his determined efforts to tie me up again.

â€œOkay.â€ He was sweating; a drop fell warm on my face as he leaned over me to check the bindings. At least he hadnâ€™t put the noose round my neck again, instead tethering me to the tree with a rope around my waist.

â€œI shoulda known what you are,â€ he murmured, intent on his job. â€œEven before you said â€˜Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.â€™â€

â€œWhat the hell do you mean by that?â€ I snapped, squirming away from his hand. â€œDonâ€™t bloody do thatâ€”Iâ€™ll suffocate!â€ He was trying to put the cloth strip back in my mouth, but seemed to pick up the note of panic in my voice, because he hesitated.

â€œOh,â€ he said uncertainly. â€œWell. I guessâ€”â€ Once again, he looked back over his shoulder, but then made up his mind and dropped the gag on the ground. â€œOkay. But you be quiet, all right? What I meantâ€”you donâ€™t act afraid of men. Most of the women from now do. You oughta act more afraid.â€

And with that parting shot, he rose and brushed dead leaves from his clothes before heading back to the fire.



THERE COMES A POINT when the body has simply had enough. It snatches at sleep, no matter what menace the future may hold. Iâ€™d seen that happen: the Jacobite soldiers who slept in the ditches where they fell, the British pilots who slept in their planes while mechanics fueled them, only to leap to full alert again in time to take off. For that matter, women in long labor routinely sleep between contractions.

In the same manner, I slept.

That kind of sleep is neither deep nor peaceful, though. I came out of it with a hand across my mouth.

The fourth man was neither incompetent nor brutal. He was large and soft-bodied, and he had loved his dead wife. I knew that, because he wept into my hair, and called me by her name at the end. It was Martha.



I CAME OUT of sleep again sometime later. Instantly, fully conscious, heart pounding. But it wasnâ€™t my heartâ€”it was a drum.

Sounds of startlement came from the direction of the fire, men rousing in alarm from sleep.

â€œIndians!â€ someone shouted, and the light broke and flared, as someone kicked at the fire to scatter it.

It wasnâ€™t an Indian drum. I sat up, listening hard. It was a drum with a sound like a beating heart, slow and rhythmic, then trip-hammer fast, like the frantic surge of a hunted beast.

I could have told them that Indians never used drums as weapons; Celts did. It was the sound of a bodhran.

What next? I thought, a trifle hysterically, bagpipes?

It was Roger, certainly; only he could make a drum talk like that. It was Roger, and Jamie was nearby. I scrambled to my feet, wanting, needing urgently to move. I jerked at the rope around my waist in a frenzy of impatience, but I was going nowhere.

Another drum began, slower, less skilled, but equally menacing. The sound seemed to moveâ€”it was moving. Fading, coming back full force. A third drum began, and now the thumping seemed to come from everywhere, fast, slow, mocking.

Someone fired a gun into the forest, panicked.

â€œHold, there!â€ Hodgepileâ€™s voice came, loud and furious, but to no avail; there was a popcorn rattle of gunfire, nearly drowned by the sound of the drums. I heard a snick near my head, and a cluster of needles brushed past me as it fell. It dawned on me that standing upright while guns were blindly fired all round me was a dangerous strategy, and I promptly fell flat, burrowing into the dead needles, trying to keep the trunk of the tree betwixt me and the main body of men.

The drums were weaving, now closer, now farther, the sound unnerving even to one who knew what it was. They were circling the camp, or so it seemed. Should I call out, if they came near enough?

I was saved from the agony of decision; the men were making so much noise round the campfire that I couldnâ€™t have been heard if Iâ€™d screamed myself hoarse. They were calling out in alarm, shouting questions, bellowing ordersâ€”which apparently went ignored, judging from the ongoing sounds of confusion.

Someone blundered through the brush nearby, running from the drums. One, two moreâ€”the sound of gasping breath and crunching footsteps. Donner? The thought came to me suddenly and I sat up, then fell flat again as another shot whistled past overhead.

The drums stopped abruptly. Chaos reigned around the fire, though I could hear Hodgepile trying to get his men in order, yelling and threatening, nasal voice raised above the rest. Then the drums began againâ€”much closer.

They were drawing in, drawing together, somewhere out in the forest on my left, and the mocking tip-tap-tip-tap beating had changed. They were thundering now. No skill, just menace. Coming closer.

Guns fired wildly, close enough for me to see the muzzle flash and smell the smoke, thick and hot on the air. The faggots of the fire had been scattered, but still burned, making a muted glow through the trees.

â€œThere they are! I see â€™em!â€ someone yelled from the fire, and there was another burst of musket-fire, toward the drums.

Then the most unearthly howl rose out of the dark to my right. Iâ€™d heard Scots scream going into battle before, but that particular Highland shriek made the hairs on my body prickle from tailbone to nape. Jamie. Despite my fears, I sat bolt upright and peered round my sheltering tree, in time to see demons boil out of the wood.

I knew themâ€”knew I knew themâ€”but cowered back at sight of them, blackened with soot and shrieking with the madness of hell, firelight red on the blades of knives and axes.

The drums had stopped abruptly, with the first scream, and now another set of howls broke out to the left, the drummers racing in to the kill. I pressed myself flat back against the tree, heart chokingly huge in my throat, petrified for fear the blades would strike at any random movement in the shadows.

Someone crashed toward me, blundering in the darkâ€”Donner? I croaked his name, hoping to attract his attention, and the slight form turned toward me, hesitated, then spotted me and lunged.

It wasnâ€™t Donner, but Hodgepile. He seized my arm, dragging me up, even as he slashed at the rope that bound me to the tree. He was panting hard with exertion, or fear.

I realized at once what he was about; he knew his chances of escape were slightâ€”having me to hostage was his only hope. But I was damned if Iâ€™d be his hostage. No more.

I kicked at him, hard, and caught him on the side of the knee. It didnâ€™t knock him over, but distracted him for a second. I charged him, head down, butted him square in the chest, and sent him flying.

The impact hurt badly, and I staggered, eyes watering from the pain. He was up, and at me again. I kicked, missed, fell heavily on my backside.

â€œCome on, damn you!â€ he hissed, jerking hard at my bound hands. I ducked my head, pulled back, and yanked him down with me. I rolled and scrabbled in the leaf mold, trying as hard as I could to wrap my legs around him, meaning to get a grip on his ribs and crush the life out of the filthy little worm, but he squirmed free and rolled atop me, punching at my head, trying to subdue me.

He struck me in one ear and I flinched, eyes shutting in reflex. Then the weight of him was suddenly gone, and I opened my eyes to see Jamie holding Hodgepile several inches off the ground. Hodgepileâ€™s spindly legs churned madly in a futile effort at escape, and I felt an insane desire to laugh.

In fact, I must actually have laughed, for Jamieâ€™s head jerked round to look at me; I caught a glimpse of the whites of his eyes before he turned his attention to Hodgepile again. He was silhouetted against a faint glow from the embers; I saw him in profile for a second, then his body flexed with effort as he bent his head.

He held Hodgepile close against his chest, one arm bent. I blinked; my eyes were swollen half-shut, and I wasnâ€™t sure what he was doing. Then I heard a small grunt of effort, and a strangled shriek from Hodgepile, and saw Jamieâ€™s bent elbow go sharply down.

The dark curve of Hodgepileâ€™s head moved backâ€”and back. I glimpsed the marionette-sharp nose and angled jawâ€”angled impossibly high, the heel of Jamieâ€™s hand wedged hard beneath it. There was a muffled pop! that I felt in the pit of my stomach as Hodgepileâ€™s neckbones parted, and the marionette went limp.

Jamie flung the puppet body down, reached for me, and pulled me to my feet.

â€œYou are alive, you are whole, mo nighean donn?â€ he said urgently in Gaelic. He was groping, hands flying over me, trying at the same time to hold me uprightâ€”my knees seemed suddenly to have turned to waterâ€”and to locate the rope that bound my hands.

I was crying and laughing, snuffing tears and blood, bumping at him with my bound hands, trying awkwardly to thrust them at him so that he could cut the rope.

He quit grappling, and clutched me so hard against him that I yelped in pain as my face was pressed against his plaid.

He was saying something else, urgently, but I couldnâ€™t manage to translate it. Energy pulsed through him, hot and violent, like the current in a live wire, and I vaguely realized that he was still almost berserk; he had no English.

â€œIâ€™m all right,â€ I gasped, and he let me go. The light flared up in the clearing beyond the trees; someone had collected the scattered embers, and thrown more kindling on them. His face was black, his eyes picked out blue in a sudden blaze as he turned his head and the light struck his face.

There was still some struggle going on; no screaming now, but I could hear the grunt and thud of bodies locked in combat. Jamie raised my hands, drew his dirk, and sawed through the rope; my hands dropped like lead weights. He stared at me for an instant, as though trying to find words, then shook his head, cupped a hand for an instant to my face, and disappeared, back in the direction of the fight.

I sank down on the ground, dazed. Hodgepileâ€™s body lay nearby, limbs askew. I glanced at it, the picture clear in my mind of a necklace Bree had had as a child, made of linked plastic beads that came apart when you pulled them. Pop-It pearls, they were called. I wished vaguely that I didnâ€™t remember that.

The face was lantern-jawed and hollow-cheeked; he looked surprised, eyes wide open to the flickering light. Something seemed oddly wrong, though, and I squinted, trying to make it out. Then I realized that his head was on backward.

It may have been seconds or minutes that I sat there staring at him, arms round my knees and my mind a total blank. Then the sound of soft footsteps made me look up.

Arch Bug came out of the dark, tall and thin and black against the flicker of a growing fire. I saw that he had an ax gripped hard in his left hand; it too was black, and the smell of blood came strong and rich as he leaned near.

â€œThere are some left still alive,â€ he said, and I felt something cold and hard touch my hand. â€œWill ye have your vengeance now upon them, a bana-mhaighistear?â€

I looked down and found that he was offering me a dirk, hilt-first. I had stood up, but couldnâ€™t remember rising.

I couldnâ€™t speak, and couldnâ€™t moveâ€”and yet my fingers curled without my willing them to, my hand rising up to take the knife as I watched it, faintly curious. Then Jamieâ€™s hand came down upon the dirk, snatching it away, and I saw as from a great distance that the light fell on his hand, gleaming wet with blood smeared past the wrist. Random drops shone red, dark jewels glowing, caught in the curly hairs of his arm.

â€œThere is an oath upon her,â€ he said to Arch, and I realized dimly that he was still speaking in Gaelic, though I understood him clearly. â€œShe may not kill, save it is for mercy or her life. It is myself who kills for her.â€

â€œAnd I,â€ said a tall figure behind him, softly. Ian.

Arch nodded understanding, though his face was still in darkness. Someone else was there beside himâ€”Fergus. I knew him at once, but it took a momentâ€™s struggle for me to put a name to the streaked pale face and wiry figure.

â€œMadame,â€ he said, and his voice was thin with shock. â€œMilady.â€

Then Jamie looked at me, and his own face changed, awareness coming back into his eyes. I saw his nostrils flare, as he caught the scent of sweat and semen on my clothes.

â€œWhich of them?â€ he said. â€œHow many?â€ He spoke in English now, and his voice was remarkably matter-of-fact, as it might be if he were inquiring as to the number of guests expected for dinner, and I found the simple tone of it steadying.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I said. â€œTheyâ€”it was dark.â€

He nodded, squeezed my arm hard, and turned.

â€œKill them all,â€ he said to Fergus, his voice still calm. Fergusâ€™s eyes were huge and dark, sunk into his head, burning. He merely nodded, and took hold of the hatchet in his belt. The front of his shirt was splashed, and the end of his hook looked dark and sticky.

In a distant sort of way, I thought I should say something. But I didnâ€™t. I stood up straight with the tree against my back and said nothing at all.

Jamie glanced at the dirk he held as though to ensure that it was in good orderâ€”it was not; he wiped the blade on his thigh, ignoring the drying blood that gummed the wooden hiltâ€”and went back to the clearing.

I stood quite still. There were more sounds, but I paid no more heed to them than to the rush of wind through the needles overhead; it was a balsam tree, and the breath of it was clean and fresh, falling over me in a wash of fragrant resins, powerful enough to taste on my palate, though little penetrated the clotted membranes of my nose. Beneath the gentle veil of the treeâ€™s perfume, I tasted blood, and sodden rags, and the stink of my own weary skin.

Dawn had broken. Birds sang in the distant wood, and light lay soft as wood ash on the ground.

I stood quite still, and thought of nothing but how pleasant it would be to stand neck-deep in hot water, to scrub the skin quite away from my flesh, and let the blood run red and clean down my legs, billowing out in soft clouds that would hide me.





29




PERFECTLY FINE




THEYâ€™D RIDDEN AWAY then. Left them, without burial or word of consecration. In a way, that was more shocking than the killing. Roger had gone with the Reverend to more than one deathbed or scene of accident, helped comfort the bereaved, stood by as the spirit fled and the old man said the words of grace. It was what you did when someone died; turned toward God and at least acknowledged the fact.

And yet . . . how could you stand over the body of a man youâ€™d killed, and look God in the face?

He couldnâ€™t sit. The tiredness filled him like wet sand, but he couldnâ€™t sit.

He stood, picked up the poker, but stood with it in hand, staring at the banked fire on his hearth. It was perfect, satin-black embers crusted with ash, the red heat smothered just beneath. To touch it would break the embers, make the flame leap upâ€”only to die at once, without fuel. A waste of wood, to throw more on, so late at night.

He put the poker down, wandered from one wall to another, an exhausted bee in a bottle, still buzzing, though his wings hung tattered and forlorn.

It hadnâ€™t troubled Fraser. But then, Fraser had ceased even to think of the bandits, directly they were dead; all his thought had been for Claire, and that was surely understandable.

Heâ€™d led her through the morning light in that clearing, a blood-soaked Adam, a battered Eve, looking upon the knowledge of good and evil. And then he had wrapped her in his plaid, picked her up, and walked away to his horse.

The men had followed, silent, leading the banditsâ€™ horses behind their own. An hour later, with the sun warm on their backs, Fraser had turned his horseâ€™s head downhill, and led them to a stream. He had dismounted, helped Claire down, then vanished with her through the trees.

The men had exchanged puzzled looks, though no one spoke. Then old Arch Bug had swung down from his mule, saying matter-of-factly, â€œWell, sheâ€™ll want to wash then, no?â€

A sigh of comprehension went over the group, and the tension lessened at once, dissolving into the small homely businesses of dismounting, hobbling, girth-checking, spitting, having a piss. Slowly, they sought each other, looking for something to say, searching for relief in commonplace.

He caught Ianâ€™s eye, but they were yet too stiff with each other for this; Ian turned, clapped a hand round Fergusâ€™s shoulder, and hugged him, then pushed him away with a small rude joke about his stink. The Frenchman gave him a tiny smile and lifted the darkened hook in salute.

Kenny Lindsay and old Arch Bug were sharing out tobacco, stuffing their pipes in apparent tranquillity. Tom Christie wandered over to them, pale as a ghost, but pipe in hand. Not for the first time, Roger realized the valuable social aspects of smoking.

Arch had seen him, though, standing aimless near his horse, and come to talk to him, the old manâ€™s voice calm and steadying. He had no real idea what Arch said, let alone what he replied; the simple act of conversation seemed to let him breathe again and still the tremors that ran over him like breaking waves.

Suddenly, the old man broke off what he was saying, and nodded over Rogerâ€™s shoulder.

â€œGo on, lad. He needs ye.â€

Roger had turned to see Jamie standing at the far side of the clearing, half-turned away and leaning on a tree, his head bowed in thought. Had he made some sign to Arch? Then Jamie glanced round, and met Rogerâ€™s eye. Yes, he wanted him, and Roger found himself standing beside Fraser, with no clear memory of having crossed the ground between them.

Jamie reached out and squeezed his hand, hard, and he held on, squeezing back.

â€œA word, a cliamhuinn,â€ Jamie said, and let go. â€œI wouldna speak so now, but there may be no good time later, and thereâ€™s little time to bide.â€ He sounded calm, too, but not like Arch. There were broken things in his voice; Roger felt the hairy bite of the rope, hearing it, and cleared his own throat.

â€œSay, then.â€

Jamie took a deep breath, and shrugged a bit, as though his shirt were too tight.

â€œThe bairn. Itâ€™s no right to ask ye, but I must. Would ye feel the same for him, and ye kent for sure he wasna your own?â€

â€œWhat?â€ Roger simply blinked, making no sense whatever of this. â€œBaiâ€”ye mean Jem?â€

Jamie nodded, eyes intent on Rogerâ€™s.

â€œWell, I . . . I dinna ken, quite,â€ Roger said, baffled as to what this was about. Why? And why now, of all times?

â€œThink.â€

He was thinking, wondering what the hell? Evidently this thought showed, for Fraser ducked his head in acknowledgment of the need to explain himself further.

â€œI ken . . . itâ€™s no likely, aye? But itâ€™s possible. She might be wiâ€™ child by the nightâ€™s work, dâ€™ye see?â€

He did see, with a blow like a fist under the breastbone. Before he could get breath to speak, Fraser went on.

â€œThereâ€™s a day or two, perhaps, when I mightâ€”â€ He glanced away, and a dull flush showed through the streaks of soot with which he had painted his face. â€œThere could be doubt, aye? As there is for you. But . . .â€ He swallowed, that â€œbutâ€ hanging eloquent.

Jamie glanced away, involuntarily, and Rogerâ€™s eyes followed the direction of his gaze. Beyond a screen of bush and red-tinged creeper, there was an eddy pool, and Claire knelt on the far side, naked, studying her reflection. The blood thundered in Rogerâ€™s ears, and he jerked his eyes away, but the image was seared on his mind.

She did not look human, was the first thing he thought. Her body mottled black with bruises, her face unrecognizable, she looked like something strange and primal, an exotic creature of the forest pool. Beyond appearance, though, it was her attitude that struck him. She was remote, somehow, and still, in the way that a tree is still, even as the air stirs its leaves.

He glanced back, unable not to. She bent over the water, studying her face. Her hair hung wet and tangled down her back, and she skimmed it back with the palm of a hand, holding it out of the way as she surveyed her battered features with dispassionate intentness.

She prodded gently here and there, opening and closing her jaw as her fingertips explored the contours of her face. Testing, he supposed, for loose teeth and broken bones. She closed her eyes and traced the lines of brow and nose, jaw and lip, hand as sure and delicate as a painterâ€™s. Then she seized the end of her nose with determination and pulled hard.

Roger cringed in reflex, as blood and tears poured down her face, but she made no sound. His stomach was already knotted into a small, painful ball; it rose up into his throat, pressing against the rope scar.

She sat back on her heels, breathing deeply, eyes closed, hands cupped over the center of her face.

He became suddenly aware that she was naked, and he was still staring. He jerked away, blood hot in his face, and glanced surreptitiously toward Jamie in hopes that Fraser had not noticed. He hadnâ€™tâ€”he was no longer there.

Roger looked wildly round, but spotted him almost at once. His relief at not being caught staring was superseded at once by a jolt of adrenaline, when he saw what Fraser was doing.

He was standing beside a body on the ground.

Fraserâ€™s gaze flicked briefly round, taking note of his men, and Roger could almost feel the effort with which Jamie suppressed his own feelings. Then Fraserâ€™s bright blue eyes fastened on the man at his feet, and Roger saw him breathe in, very slowly.

Lionel Brown.

Quite without meaning to, Roger had found himself striding across the clearing. He took up his place at Jamieâ€™s right without conscious thought, his attention similarly fixed on the man on the ground.

Brownâ€™s eyes were shut, but he wasnâ€™t asleep. His face was bruised and swollen, as well as patched with fever, but the expression of barely suppressed panic was plain on his battered features. Fully justified, too, so far as Roger could see.

The sole survivor of the nightâ€™s work, Brown was still alive only because Arch Bug had stopped young Ian Murray inches away from smashing his skull with a tomahawk. Not from any hesitation about killing an injured man, from cold pragmatism.

â€œYour uncle will have questions,â€ Arch had said, narrowed eyes on Brown. â€œLet this one live long enough to answer them.â€

Ian had said nothing, but pulled his arm from Arch Bugâ€™s grasp and turned on his heel, disappearing into the shadows of the forest like smoke.

Jamieâ€™s face was much less expressive than his captiveâ€™s, Roger thought. He himself could tell nothing of Fraserâ€™s thoughts from his expressionâ€”but scarcely needed to. The man was still as stone, but seemed nonetheless to throb with something slow and inexorable. Merely to stand near him was terrifying.

â€œHow say you, O, friend?â€ Fraser said at last, turning to Arch, who stood on the far side of the pallet, white-haired and blood-streaked. â€œCan he be traveling further, or will the journey kill him?â€

Bug leaned forward, peering dispassionately at the supine Brown.

â€œI say he will live. His face is red, not white, and he is awake. You wish to take him with us, or ask your questions now?â€

For a brief instant the mask lifted, and Roger, who had been watching Jamieâ€™s face, saw in his eyes precisely what he wished to do. Had Lionel Brown seen it, too, he would have leaped off his pallet and run, broken leg or no. But his eyes stayed stubbornly shut, and as Jamie and old Arch were speaking in Gaelic, Brown remained in ignorance.

Without answering Archâ€™s question, Jamie knelt and put his hand on Brownâ€™s chest. Roger could see the pulse hammering in Brownâ€™s neck and the manâ€™s breathing, quick and shallow. Still, he kept his lids squeezed tight shut, though the eyeballs rolled to and fro, frantic beneath them.

Jamie stayed motionless for what seemed a long timeâ€”and must have been an eternity to Brown. Then he made a small sound that might have been either a contemptuous laugh or a snort of disgust, and rose.

â€œWe take him. See that he lives, then,â€ he said in English. â€œFor now.â€

Brown had continued to play possum through the journey to the Ridge, in spite of the bloodthirsty speculations various of the party had made within his hearing on the way. Roger had helped to unstrap him from the travois at journeyâ€™s end. His garments and wrappings were soaked with sweat, the smell of fear a palpable miasma round him.

Claire had made a movement toward the injured man, frowning, but Jamie had stopped her with a hand on her arm. Roger hadnâ€™t heard what he murmured to her, but she nodded and went with him into the Big House. A moment later, Mrs. Bug had appeared, uncharacteristically silent, and taken charge of Lionel Brown.

Murdina Bug was not like Jamie, nor old Arch; her thoughts were plain to see in the bloodless seam of her mouth and the thunderous brow. But Lionel Brown took water from her hand and, open-eyed, watched her as though she were the light of his salvation. She would, Roger thought, have been pleased to kill Brown like one of the cockroaches she ruthlessly exterminated from her kitchen. But Jamie wished him kept alive, so alive he would stay.

For now.

A sound at the door jerked Rogerâ€™s attention back to the present. Brianna!

It wasnâ€™t, though, when he opened the door; only the rattle of wind-tossed twigs and acorn caps. He looked down the dark path, hoping to see her, but there was no sign of her yet. Of course, he told himself, Claire would likely need her.

So do I.

He squashed the thought, but stayed at the door, looking out, wind whining in his ears. Sheâ€™d gone up to the Big House at once, the moment he came to tell her that her mother was safe. He hadnâ€™t said much more, but she had seen something of how matters stoodâ€”there was blood on his clothesâ€”and had barely paused to assure herself that none of it was his before rushing out.

He closed the door carefully, looking to see that the draft hadnâ€™t wakened Jemmy. He had an immense urge to pick the boy up, and in spite of long-ingrained parental wariness about disturbing a sleeping child, scooped Jem out of his trundle; he had to.

Jem was heavy in his arms, and groggy. He stirred, lifted his head, and blinked, blue eyes glassy with sleep.

â€œItâ€™s okay,â€ Roger whispered, patting his back. â€œDaddyâ€™s here.â€

Jem sighed like a punctured tire and dropped his head on Rogerâ€™s shoulder with the force of a spent cannonball. He seemed to inflate again for a moment, but then put his thumb in his mouth and subsided into that peculiarly boneless state common to sleeping children. His flesh seemed to melt comfortably into Rogerâ€™s own, his trust so complete that it was not necessary even to maintain the boundaries of his bodyâ€”Daddy would do that.

Roger closed his eyes against starting tears, and pressed his mouth against the soft warmth of Jemmyâ€™s hair.

The firelight made black and red shadows on the insides of his lids; by looking at them, he could keep the tears at bay. It didnâ€™t matter what he saw there. He had a small collection of grisly moments, vivid from the dawn, but he could look at those unmovedâ€”for now. It was the sleeping trust in his arms that moved him, and the echo of his own whispered words.

Was it even a memory? Perhaps it was no more than a wishâ€”that he had once been roused from sleep, only to sleep again in strong arms, hearing, â€œDaddyâ€™s here.â€

He took deep breaths, slowing to the rhythm of Jemâ€™s breathing, calming himself. It seemed important not to weep, even though there was no one to see or care.

Jamie had looked at him, as they moved from Brownâ€™s pallet, the question clear in his eyes.

â€œYe dinna think I mind only for myself, I hope?â€ he had said, low-voiced. His eyes had turned toward the gap in the brush where Claire had gone, half-squinting as though he could not bear to look, but couldnâ€™t keep his eyes away.

â€œFor her,â€ he said, so low that Roger scarcely heard. â€œWould she rather . . . have the doubt, dâ€™ye think? If it came to that.â€

Roger took a deep breath of his sonâ€™s hair, and hoped to God heâ€™d said the right thing, there among the trees.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ heâ€™d said. â€œBut for youâ€”if thereâ€™s room for doubtâ€”I say, take it.â€

If Jamie were disposed to follow that advice, Bree should be home soon.



â€œIâ€™M FINE,â€ I said firmly. â€œPerfectly fine.â€

Bree narrowed her eyes at me.

â€œSure you are,â€ she said. â€œYou look like youâ€™ve been run over by a locomotive. Two locomotives.â€

â€œYes,â€ I said, and touched my split lip gingerly. â€œWell. Yes. Other than that, though . . .â€

â€œAre you hungry? Sit down, Mama, Iâ€™ll make you some tea, then maybe a little supper.â€

I wasnâ€™t hungry, didnâ€™t want tea, and particularly didnâ€™t want to sit downâ€”not after a long day on horseback. Brianna was already taking down the teapot from its shelf above the sideboard, though, and I couldnâ€™t find the proper words to stop her. All of a sudden, I seemed to have no words at all. I turned toward Jamie, helpless.

He somehow divined my feeling, though he couldnâ€™t have read much of anything on my face, given its current state. He stepped forward, though, and took the teapot from her, murmuring something too low for me to catch. She frowned at him, glanced at me, then back, still frowning. Then her face changed a little, and she came toward me, looking searchingly into my face.

â€œA bath?â€ she asked quietly. â€œShampoo?â€

â€œOh, yes,â€ I said, and my shoulders sagged in grateful relief. â€œPlease.â€

I did sit down then, after all, and let her sponge my hands and feet, and wash my hair in a basin of warm water drawn from the cauldron in the hearth. She did it quietly, humming under her breath, and I began to relax under the soothing scrub of her long, strong fingers.

Iâ€™d sleptâ€”from sheer exhaustionâ€”part of the way, leaning on Jamieâ€™s chest. Thereâ€™s no way of achieving real rest on horseback, though, and I found myself now close to nodding off, noticing only in a dreamy, detached sort of way that the water in the basin had turned a grubby, cloudy red, full of grit and leaf fragments.

Iâ€™d changed to a clean shift; the feel of the worn linen on my skin was sheer luxury, cool and smooth.

Bree was humming softly, under her breath. What was it . . . â€œMr. Tambourine Man,â€ I thought. One of those sweetly silly songs of the sixtâ€”

1968.

I gasped, and Breeâ€™s hands gripped my head, steadying me.

â€œMama? Are you all right? Did I touch somethingâ€”â€

â€œNo! No, Iâ€™m fine,â€ I said, looking down into the swirls of dirt and blood. I took a deep breath, heart pounding. â€œPerfectly fine. Justâ€”began to doze off, thatâ€™s all.â€

She snorted, but took her hands away and went to fetch a pitcher of water for rinsing, leaving me gripping the edge of the table and trying not to shudder.

You donâ€™t act afraid of men. You oughta act more afraid. That particularly ironic echo came to me clearly, along with the outline of the young manâ€™s head, leonine hair seen silhouetted by the firelight. I couldnâ€™t recall his face clearlyâ€”but surely I would have noticed that hair?

Jamie had taken my arm, afterward, and led me out from under my sheltering tree, into the clearing. The fire had been scattered during the fight; there were blackened rocks and patches of singed and flattened grass here and thereâ€”among the bodies. He had led me slowly from one to another. At the last, he had paused, and said quietly, â€œYe see that they are dead?â€

I did, and knew why he had shown meâ€”so I need not fear their return, or their vengeance. But I had not thought to count them. Or to look closely at their faces. Even had I been sure how many there were . . . another shiver struck me, and Bree wrapped a warm towel around my shoulders, murmuring words I didnâ€™t hear for the questions clamoring in my head.

Was Donner among the dead? Or had he heeded me, when Iâ€™d told him that if he were wise, heâ€™d run? He hadnâ€™t struck me as a wise young man.

He had struck me as a coward, though.

Warm water sluiced around my ears, drowning out the sound of Jamieâ€™s and Briannaâ€™s voices overhead; I caught only a word or two, but when I sat back up, with water dripping down my neck, clutching a towel to my hair, Bree was reluctantly moving toward her cloak, hung on the peg by the door.

â€œAre you sure youâ€™re all right, Mama?â€ The worried frown was back between her brows, but this time I could muster a few words of reassurance.

â€œThank you, darling; that was wonderful,â€ I said, with complete sincerity. â€œAll I want just now is sleep,â€ I added with somewhat less.

I was still terribly tired, but now completely wakeful. What I did want was . . . well, I didnâ€™t know quite what I did want, but a general absence of solicitous company was on the list. Besides, Iâ€™d caught a glimpse of Roger earlier, bloodstained, white, and swaying with weariness; I wasnâ€™t the only victim of the recent unpleasantness.

â€œGo home, lass,â€ Jamie said softly. He swung the cloak from its peg and over her shoulders, patting her gently. â€œFeed your man. Take him to bed, and say a prayer for him. Iâ€™ll mind your mother, aye?â€

Breeâ€™s gaze swung between us, blue and troubled, but I put on what I hoped was a reassuring expressionâ€”it hurt to do it, ratherâ€”and after a momentâ€™s hesitation, she hugged me tight, kissed my forehead very gently, and left.

Jamie shut the door and stood with his back against it, hands behind him. I was used to the impassive facade he normally used to shield his thoughts when troubled or angry; he wasnâ€™t using it, and the expression on his face troubled me no end.

â€œYou mustnâ€™t worry about me,â€ I said, as reassuringly as I could. â€œIâ€™m not traumatized, or anything of that sort.â€

â€œI mustnâ€™t?â€ he asked guardedly. â€œWell . . . perhaps I wouldna, if I kent what ye meant by it.â€

â€œOh.â€ I blotted my damp face gingerly, and patted at my neck with the towel. â€œWell. It means . . . very much injuredâ€”or dreadfully shocked. Itâ€™s Greek, I thinkâ€”the root word, I mean, â€˜trauma.â€™â€

â€œOh, aye? And youâ€™re not . . . shocked. Ye say.â€

His eyes narrowed, as he examined me with the sort of critical attention usually employed when contemplating the purchase of expensive bloodstock.

â€œIâ€™m fine,â€ I said, backing away a little. â€œJustâ€”Iâ€™m all right. Only a bit . . . shaken.â€

He took a step toward me, and I backed up abruptly, aware belatedly that I was clutching the towel to my bosom as though it were a shield. I forced myself to lower it, and felt blood prickle unpleasantly in patches over face and neck.

He stood very still, regarding me with that same narrow look. Then his gaze dropped to the floor between us. He stood as though deep in thought, and then his big hands flexed. Once, twice. Very slowly. And I heardâ€”heard clearlyâ€”the sound of Arvin Hodgepileâ€™s vertebrae parting one from another.

Jamieâ€™s head jerked up, startled, and I realized that I was standing on the other side of the chair from him, the towel wadded and pressed against my mouth. My elbows moved like rusty hinges, stiff and slow, but I got the towel down. My lips were nearly as stiff, but I spoke, too.

â€œI am a little shaken, yes,â€ I said very clearly. â€œIâ€™ll be all right. Donâ€™t worry. I donâ€™t want you to worry.â€

The troubled scrutiny in his eyes wavered suddenly, like the glass of a window struck by a stone, in the split second before it shatters, and he shut his eyes. He swallowed once, and opened them again.

â€œClaire,â€ he said very softly, and the smashed and splintered fragments showed clear, sharp and jagged in his eyes. â€œI have been raped. And ye say I must not worry for ye?â€

â€œOh, God damn it!â€ I flung the towel on the floor, and immediately wished I had it back again. I felt naked, standing in my shift, and hated the crawling of my skin with a sudden passion that made me slap my thigh to kill it.

â€œDamn, damn, damn it! I donâ€™t want you to have to think of that again. I donâ€™t!â€ And yet I had known from the first that this would happen.

I took hold of the chairback with both hands and held tight, and tried to force my own gaze into his, wanting so badly to throw myself upon those glittering shards, to shield him from them.

â€œLook,â€ I said, steadying my voice. â€œI donâ€™t wantâ€”I donâ€™t want to make you recall things better left forgotten.â€

The corner of his mouth actually twitched at that.

â€œGod,â€ he said, in something like wonder. â€œYe think Iâ€™d forgot any of it?â€

â€œMaybe not,â€ I said, surrendering. I looked at him through swimming eyes. â€œButâ€”oh, Jamie, I so wanted you to forget!â€

He put out a hand, very delicately, and touched the tip of his index finger to the tip of mine, where I clutched the chair.

â€œDinna mind it,â€ he said softly, and withdrew the finger. â€œItâ€™s no matter now. Will ye rest a bit, Sassenach? Or eat, maybe?â€

â€œNo. I donâ€™t want . . . no.â€ In fact, I couldnâ€™t decide what I wanted to do. I didnâ€™t want to do anything at all. Other than unzip my skin, climb out, and runâ€”and that didnâ€™t seem feasible. I took a few deep breaths, hoping to settle myself and go back to that nice sense of utter exhaustion.

Should I ask him about Donner? But what was there to ask? â€œDid you happen to kill a man with long, tangled hair?â€ Theyâ€™d all looked like that, to some extent. Donner had beenâ€”or possibly still wasâ€”an Indian, but no one would have noticed that in the dark, in the heat of fighting.

â€œHowâ€”how is Roger?â€ I asked, for lack of anything better to say. â€œAnd Ian? Fergus?â€

He looked a little startled, as though he had forgotten their existence.

â€œThem? The lads are well enough. No one took any hurt in the fight. We had luck.â€

He hesitated, then took a careful step toward me, watching my face. I didnâ€™t scream or bolt, and he took another, coming close enough that I could feel the warmth of his body. Not startled this time, and chilly in my damp shift, I relaxed a little, swaying toward him, and saw the tension in his own shoulders let go slightly, seeing it.

He touched my face, very gently. The blood throbbed just below the surface, tender, and I had to brace myself not to flinch away from his touch. He saw it, and drew back his hand a little, so that it hovered just above my skinâ€”I could feel the heat of his palm.

â€œWill it heal?â€ he asked, fingertips moving over the split in my left brow, then down the minefield of my cheek to the scrape on my jaw where Harley Bobleâ€™s boot had just missed making a solid connection that would have broken my neck.

â€œOf course it will. You know that; youâ€™ve seen worse on battlefields.â€ I would have smiled in reassurance, but didnâ€™t want to open the deep split in my lip again, and so made a sort of pouting goldfish mouth, which took him by surprise and made him smile.

â€œAye, I know.â€ He ducked his head a little, shy. â€œItâ€™s only . . .â€ His hand still hovered near my face, an expression of troubled anxiety on his own. â€œOh, God, mo nighean donn,â€ he said softly. â€œOh, Christ, your lovely face.â€

â€œCan you not bear to look at it?â€ I asked, turning my own eyes away and feeling a sharp little pang at the thought, but trying to convince myself that it didnâ€™t matter. It would heal, after all.

His fingers touched my chin, gently but firmly, and drew it up, so that I faced him again. His mouth tightened a little as his gaze moved slowly over my battered face, taking inventory. His eyes were soft and dark in the candlelight, the corners tight with pain.

â€œNo,â€ he said quietly, â€œI cannot bear it. The sight of ye tears my heart. And it fills me with such rage I think I must kill someone or burst. But by the God who made ye, Sassenach, Iâ€™ll not lie with ye and be unable to look ye in the face.â€

â€œLie with me?â€ I said blankly. â€œWhat . . . you mean now?â€

His hand dropped from my chin, but he looked steadily at me, not blinking.

â€œWell . . . aye. I do.â€

Had my jaw not been so swollen, my mouth would have dropped open in pure astonishment.

â€œAh . . . why?â€

â€œWhy?â€ he repeated. He dropped his gaze then, and made the odd shrugging motion that he made when embarrassed or discomposed. â€œIâ€”wellâ€”it seems . . . necessary.â€

I had a thoroughly unsuitable urge to laugh.

â€œNecessary? Do you think itâ€™s like being thrown by a horse? I ought to get straight back on?â€

His head jerked up and he shot me an angry glance.

â€œNo,â€ he said, between clenched teeth. He swallowed hard and visibly, obviously reining in strong feelings. â€œAre yeâ€”are ye badly damaged, then?â€

I stared at him as best I could, through my swollen lids.

â€œIs that a joke of someâ€”oh,â€ I said, it finally dawning on me what he meant. I felt heat rise in my face, and my bruises throbbed.

I took a deep breath, to be sure of being able to speak steadily.

â€œI have been beaten to a bloody pulp, Jamie, and abused in several nasty ways. But only one . . . there was only the one who actually . . . Heâ€”he wasnâ€™t . . . rough.â€ I swallowed, but the hard knot in my throat didnâ€™t budge perceptibly. Tears made the candlelight blur so that I couldnâ€™t see his face, and I looked away, blinking.

â€œNo!â€ I said, my voice sounding rather louder than I intended. â€œIâ€™m not . . . damaged.â€

He said something in Gaelic under his breath, short and explosive, and shoved himself away from the table. His stool fell over with a loud crash, and he kicked it. Then he kicked it again, and again, and stamped on it with such violence that bits of wood flew across the kitchen and struck the pie safe with little pinging sounds.

I sat completely still, too shocked and numb to feel distress. Should I not have told him? I wondered vaguely. But he knew, surely. He had asked, when he found me. â€œHow many?â€ he had demanded. And then had said, â€œKill them all.â€

But then . . . to know something was one thing, and to be told the details another. I did know that, and watched with a dim sense of guilty sorrow as he kicked away the splinters of the stool and flung himself at the window. It was shuttered, but he stood, hands braced on the sill and his back turned to me, shoulders heaving. I couldnâ€™t tell if he was crying.

The wind was rising; there was a squall coming in from the west. The shutters rattled, and the night-smoored fire spouted puffs of soot as the wind came down the chimney. Then the gust passed, and there was no sound but the small sudden crack! of an ember in the hearth.

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ I said at last, in a small voice.

Jamie swiveled on his heel at once and glared at me. He wasnâ€™t crying, but he had been; his cheeks were wet.

â€œDonâ€™t you dare be sorry!â€ he roared. â€œI willna have it, dâ€™ye hear?â€ He took a giant step toward the table and crashed his fist down on it, hard enough to make the saltcellar jump and fall over. â€œDonâ€™t be sorry!â€

I had closed my eyes in reflex, but forced myself to open them again.

â€œAll right,â€ I said. I felt terribly, terribly tired again, and very much like crying myself. â€œI wonâ€™t.â€

There was a charged silence. I could hear chestnuts falling in the grove behind the house, dislodged by the wind. One, and then another, and another, a rain of muffled tiny thumps. Then Jamie drew a deep, shuddering breath, and wiped a sleeve across his face.

I put my elbows on the table and leaned my head on my hands; it seemed much too heavy to hold up anymore.

â€œNecessary,â€ I said, more or less calmly to the tabletop. â€œWhat did you mean, necessary?â€

â€œDoes it not occur to you that ye might be with child?â€ Heâ€™d got himself back under control, and said this as calmly as he might have asked whether I planned to serve bacon with the breakfast porridge.

Startled, I looked up at him.

â€œIâ€™m not.â€ But my hands had gone by reflex to my belly.

â€œIâ€™m not,â€ I repeated more strongly. â€œI canâ€™t be.â€ I could, thoughâ€”just possibly. The chance was a remote one, but it existed. I normally used some form of contraception, just to be certainâ€”but obviously . . .

â€œI am not,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™d know.â€

He merely stared at me, eyebrows raised. I wouldnâ€™t; not so soon. So soonâ€”soon enough that if it were so, and if there were more than one man . . . there would be doubt. The benefit of the doubt; thatâ€™s what he offered meâ€”and himself.

A deep shudder started in the depths of my womb and spread instantly through my body, making goose bumps break out on my skin, despite the warmth of the room.

â€œMartha,â€ the man had whispered, the weight of him pressing me into the leaves.

â€œBloody, bloody hell,â€ I said very quietly. I spread my hands out flat on the table, trying to think.

â€œMartha.â€ And the stale smell of him, the meaty press of damp bare thighs, rasping with hairâ€”

â€œNo!â€ My legs and buttocks pressed together so tightly in revulsion that I rose an inch or two on the bench.

â€œYou mightâ€”â€ Jamie began stubbornly.

â€œIâ€™m not,â€ I repeated, just as stubbornly. â€œBut even ifâ€”you canâ€™t, Jamie.â€

He looked at me, and I caught the flicker of fear in his eyes. That, I realized with a jolt, was exactly what he was afraid of. Or one of the things.

â€œI mean we canâ€™t,â€ I said quickly. â€œIâ€™m almost sure that Iâ€™m not pregnantâ€”but Iâ€™m not at all sure that I havenâ€™t been exposed to some disgusting disease.â€ That was something else I hadnâ€™t thought of until now, and the goose bumps were back in full force. Pregnancy was unlikely; gonorrhea or syphilis werenâ€™t. â€œWeâ€”we canâ€™t. Not until Iâ€™ve had a course of penicillin.â€

I was rising from the bench even as I spoke.

â€œWhere are ye going?â€ he asked, startled.

â€œThe surgery!â€

The hallway was dark, and the fire out in my surgery, but that didnâ€™t stop me. I flung open the door of the cupboard, and began groping hastily about. A light fell over my shoulder, illuminating the shimmering row of bottles. Jamie had lit a taper and come after me.

â€œWhat in the name of God are ye doing, Sassenach?â€

â€œPenicillin,â€ I said, seizing one of the bottles and the leather pouch in which I kept my snake-fang syringes.

â€œNow?â€

â€œYes, bloody now! Light the candle, will you?â€

He did, and the light wavered and grew into a globe of warm yellow, gleaming off the leather tubes of my homemade syringes. I had a good bit of penicillin mixture to hand, luckily. The liquid in the bottle was pink; many of the Penicillium colonies from this batch had been grown in stale wine.

â€œAre ye sure it will work?â€ Jamie asked quietly, from the shadows.

â€œNo,â€ I said, tight-lipped. â€œBut itâ€™s what I have.â€ The thought of spirochetes, multiplying silently in my bloodstream, second by second, was making my hand shake. I choked down the fear that the penicillin might be defective. It had worked miracles on gross superficial infections. There was no reason whyâ€”

â€œLet me do it, Sassenach.â€ Jamie took the syringe from my hand; my fingers were slippery and fumbling. His were steady, his face calm in candlelight as he filled the syringe.

â€œDo me first, then,â€ he said, handing it back.

â€œWhatâ€”you? But you donâ€™t need toâ€”I meanâ€”you hate injections,â€ I ended feebly.

He snorted briefly and lowered his brows at me.

â€œListen, Sassenach. If I mean to fight my own fears, and yoursâ€”and I doâ€”then I shallna boggle at pinpricks, aye? Do it!â€ He turned his side to me and bent over, one elbow braced on the counter, and hitched up the side of his kilt, baring one muscular buttock.

I wasnâ€™t sure whether to laugh or cry. I might have argued further with him, but a glance at him, standing there bare-arsed and stubborn as Black Mountain, decided me of the futility of that. Heâ€™d made up his mind, and we were both going to live with the consequences.

Feeling suddenly and oddly calm, I lifted the syringe, squeezing gently to remove any air bubbles.

â€œShift your weight, then,â€ I said, nudging him rudely. â€œRelax this side; I donâ€™t want to break the needle.â€

He drew in his breath with a hiss; the needle was thick, and there was enough alcohol from the wine to make it sting badly, as I discovered when I took my own injection a minute later.

â€œOuch! Ow! Oh, Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!â€ I exclaimed, gritting my teeth as I withdrew the needle from my thigh. â€œChrist, that hurts!â€

Jamie gave me a lopsided smile, still rubbing his backside.

â€œAye, well. The rest of it wonâ€™t be worse than this, I expect.â€

The rest of it. I felt suddenly hollow, and light-headed with it, as though I hadnâ€™t eaten for a week.

â€œYouâ€”youâ€™re sure?â€ I asked, putting down the syringe.

â€œNo,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m not.â€ He took a deep breath then, and looked at me, his face uncertain in the wavering candlelight. â€œBut I mean to try. I must.â€

I smoothed the linen night rail down over my punctured thigh, looking at him as I did it. Heâ€™d dropped all his masks long since; the doubt, the anger, and the fear were all there, etched plain in the desperate lines of his face. For once, I thought, my own countenance was less easy to read, masked behind its bruises.

Something soft brushed past my leg with a small mirp! and I looked down to see that Adso had brought me a dead vole, no doubt by way of sympathy. I started to smile, felt my lip tingle, and then looked up at Jamie and let it split as I did smile, the taste of blood warm silver on my tongue.

â€œWell . . . youâ€™ve come whenever Iâ€™ve needed you; I rather think youâ€™ll do it this time, too.â€

He looked completely blank for an instant, not grasping the feeble joke. Then it struck him, and blood rushed to his face. His lip twitched, and twitched again, unable to decide between shock and laughter.

I thought he turned his back then to hide his face, but in fact, he had only turned to search the cupboard. He found what he was looking for, and turned round again with a bottle of my best muscat wine in his hand, shining dark. He held it to his body with his elbow, and took down another.

â€œAye, I will,â€ he said, reaching out his free hand to me. â€œBut if ye think either one of us is going to do this sober, Sassenach, yeâ€™re verra much mistaken.â€



A GUST OF WIND from the open door roused Roger from uneasy sleep. He had fallen asleep on the settle, his legs trailing on the floor, Jemmy snuggled warmly heavy on his chest.

He looked up, blinking and disoriented, as Brianna stooped to take the little boy from his arms.

â€œIs it raining out?â€ he said, catching a whiff of damp and ozone from her cloak. He sat up and rubbed a hand over his face to rouse himself, feeling the scruff of a four-day beard.

â€œNo, but itâ€™s going to.â€ She laid Jemmy back in his trundle, covered him, and hung up the cloak before coming to Roger. She smelled of the night, and her hand was cold on his flushed cheek. He put his arms round her waist and leaned his head against her, sighing.

He would have been happy to stay that way foreverâ€”or at least the next hour or two. She stroked his head gently for a moment, though, then moved away, stooping to light the candle from the hearth.

â€œYou must be starved. Shall I fix you something?â€

â€œNo. I mean . . . yes. Please.â€ As the last remnants of grogginess fell away, he realized that he was, in fact, starving. After their stop at the stream in the morning, they hadnâ€™t stopped again, Jamie anxious to get home. He couldnâ€™t recall when heâ€™d last eaten, but hadnâ€™t felt any sense of hunger at all until this minute.

He fell on the bread and butter and jam she brought him, ravenous. He ate single-mindedly, and it was several minutes before he thought to ask, swallowing a final thick, buttery, sweet bite, â€œHowâ€™s your mother?â€

â€œFine,â€ she said, with an excellent imitation of Claire with her stiffest English upper lip. â€œPerfectly fine.â€ She grimaced at him, and he laughed, though quietly, with an automatic glance at the trundle.

â€œIs she, then?â€

Bree raised an eyebrow at him.

â€œDo you think so?â€

â€œNo,â€ he admitted, sobering. â€œBut I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s going to tell you if sheâ€™s not. Sheâ€™ll not want ye worrying.â€

She made a rather rude glottal noise in response to this notion, and turned her back on him, lifting the long veil of hair off her neck.

â€œWill you do my laces?â€

â€œYou sound just like your father when ye make that noiseâ€”only higher-pitched. Have ye been practicing?â€ He stood up and pulled the laces loose. Undid her stays as well, then on impulse, slid his hands inside the opened gown, resting them on the warm swell of her hips.

â€œEvery day. Have you?â€ She leaned back against him, and his hands came up, cupping her breasts by reflex.

â€œNo,â€ he admitted. â€œIt hurts.â€ It was Claireâ€™s suggestionâ€”that he try to sing, pitching his voice both higher and lower than normal, in hopes of loosening his vocal cords, perhaps restoring a bit of his original resonance.

â€œCoward,â€ she said, but her voice was nearly as soft as the hair that brushed his cheek.

â€œAye, I am,â€ he said as softly. It did hurt, but it wasnâ€™t the physical pain that he minded. It was feeling the echo of his old voice in his bonesâ€”the ease and power of itâ€”and then hearing the uncouth noises that emerged with such difficulty now from his throatâ€”croaks and grunts and squeals. Like a pig choking to death on a crow, he thought disparagingly.

â€œItâ€™s them that are cowards,â€ Bree said, still speaking softly, but with steel in her voice. She tensed a little in his arms. â€œHer faceâ€”her poor face! How could they? How could anybody do something like that?â€

He had a sudden vision of Claire, naked by the pool, silent as the rocks, her breasts streaked with the blood from her newly set nose. He drew back, nearly jerking his hands away.

â€œWhat?â€ Brianna said, startled. â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€

â€œNothing.â€ He pulled his hands out of her gown and stepped back. â€œIâ€”er, is there maybe a bit of milk?â€

She looked at him oddly, but went out to the lean-to at the back and brought in a jug of milk. He drank it thirstily, aware of her eyes on him, watchful as a catâ€™s, as she undressed and changed into her night rail.

She sat down on the bed and began to brush out her hair, preparing to plait it for sleep. On impulse, he reached out and took the brush from her. Without speaking, he ran one hand through the thickness of her hair, lifting it, smoothing it back from her face.

â€œYouâ€™re beautiful,â€ he whispered, and felt tears come to his eyes again.

â€œSo are you.â€ She lifted her hands to his shoulders and brought him slowly down to his knees before her. She looked searchingly into his eyesâ€”he did his best to look back. She smiled a little, then, and reached to untie the thong that held his own hair back.

It fell around his shoulders in a dusty black tangle, smelling of burned things, stale sweat, and horses. He protested when she took up her hairbrush, but she ignored him, and made him bend his head over her lap, while she picked pine straw and sandburs from his head, slowly working out the snarls. His head bent lower, and lower still, and he found himself at last with his forehead pressed into her lap, breathing in the close scent of her.

He was reminded of medieval paintings, sinners kneeling, heads bowed in confession and remorse. Presbyterians did not confess on their kneesâ€”Catholics still did, he thought. In darkness, like thisâ€”in anonymity.

â€œYeâ€™ve not asked me what happened,â€ he whispered at last, to the shadows of her thighs. â€œDid your father tell ye?â€

He heard her draw breath, but her voice was calm when she replied.

â€œNo.â€

She said no more, and the room was quiet, save for the sound of the brush through his hair, and the rising rush of the wind outside.

How would it be for Jamie? Roger wondered suddenly. Would he really do it? Try to . . . He shied away from the thought, unable to contemplate it. Seeing instead a picture of Claire, coming out of the dawn, her face a swollen mask. Still herself, but remote as a distant planet on an orbit departing for the outer reaches of deep spaceâ€”when might it come in sight again? Stooping to touch the dead, at Jamieâ€™s urging, to see for herself the price of her honor.

It wasnâ€™t the possibility of a child, he thought suddenly. It was fearâ€”but not of that. It was Jamieâ€™s fear that he would lose herâ€”that she would go, swing out into a dark and solitary space without him, unless he could somehow bind her to him, keep her with him. But, Christ, what a risk to takeâ€”with a woman so shocked and brutalized, how could he risk it?

How could he not?

Brianna laid down the brush, though she kept a hand gently on his head, stroking it. He knew that fear too well himselfâ€”remembered the gulf that once had lain between them, and the courage it had taken to leap over it. For both of them.

He was some kind of a coward, maybeâ€”but not that kind.

â€œBrianna,â€ he said, and felt the lump in his throat, the scar of the rope. She heard the need in his voice and looked at him as he raised his head, hand lifting toward his face, and he seized it hard, pressing the palm of it against his cheek, rubbing against it.

â€œBrianna,â€ he said again.

â€œWhat? What is it?â€ Her voice was soft, not to wake the bairn, but full of urgency.

â€œBrianna, will ye hear me?â€

â€œYou know I will. What is it?â€ Her body was against him, wanting to tend him, and he desired the comfort of her so badly that he would have lain down there on the rug before the fire and buried his head between her breastsâ€”but not yet.

â€œOnlyâ€”listen to what I must say. And thenâ€”please Godâ€”tell me I have done right.â€ Tell me that you love me, still, he meant, but could not say it.

â€œYou donâ€™t have to tell me anything,â€ she whispered. Her eyes were dark and soft, bottomless with forgiveness not yet earned. And somewhere beyond them, he saw another pair of eyes, staring up at him in drunken bewilderment, changing abruptly into fear as he raised his arm for the killing blow.

â€œYes, I do,â€ he said softly. â€œPut out the candle, aye?â€



NOT THE KITCHEN, still strewn with emotional wreckage. Not the surgery, with all its sharp-edged memories. Jamie hesitated, but then nodded toward the stair, raising one eyebrow. I nodded, and followed him up to our bedroom.

It seemed both familiar and strange, as places do when one is away for a time. Perhaps it was only my injured nose that made it smell strange, too; perhaps I only imagined that I could smell itâ€”cold and somehow stale, though everything was swept and dusted. Jamie poked up the fire and light sprang up, wavering in bright swaths over the wooden walls, the scents of smoke and hot resin helping to fill the sense of emptiness in the room.

Neither of us glanced toward the bed. He lit the candlestick on the washstand, then set our two stools near the window, and opened the shutters to the restless night. Heâ€™d brought two pewter cups; he filled these and set them on the broad sill, along with the bottles.

I stood just inside the doorway, watching his preparations, feeling thoroughly peculiar.

I was suffering the oddest contradiction of feelings. On the one hand, I felt as though he were a complete stranger. I could not even imagine, let alone recall, a sense of ease in touching him. His body was no longer the comfortable extension of my own, but something foreign, unapproachable.

At the same time, alarming surges of lust ripped through me without warning. It had been happening all day. This was nothing like the slow burn of accustomed desire, nor yet the instant spark of passion. Not even that cyclic and mindless womb-yearning sense of a need to mate that belonged entirely to the body. This was frightening.

He stooped to put another stick on the fire, and I nearly staggered, as all the blood left my head. The light shone on the hair of his arms, the dark hollows of his faceâ€”

It was the sheer impersonal sense of a voracious appetiteâ€”something that possessed me, but was not part of meâ€”that terrified me. It was fear of it that made me avoid his touch, more than the feeling of estrangement.

â€œAre ye all right, Sassenach?â€ He had caught sight of my face, and stepped toward me, frowning. I held up a hand to stop him.

â€œFine,â€ I said, feeling breathless. I sat down hastily, my knees weak, and picked up one of the cups he had just filled. â€œUm . . . cheers.â€

Both his brows went up, but he moved to take his own seat opposite me.

â€œCheers,â€ he said quietly, and touched his cup to mine, the wine heavy and sweet-smelling in my hand.

My fingers were cold; so were my toes, and the tip of my nose. That changed, too, without warning. Another minute, and I might be suffused with heat, sweating and flushed. But for the moment, I was cold, and shivered in the rainy breeze from the window.

The wineâ€™s aroma was strong enough to make an impact, even on my damaged membranes, and the sweetness was a comfort to nerves and stomach alike. I drank the first cup quickly, and poured another, urgently wanting a small layer of oblivion between reality and myself.

Jamie drank more slowly, but refilled his own cup when I did. The cedar blanket chest, warmed by the fire, was beginning to spread its own familiar fragrance through the room. He glanced at me now and then, but said nothing. The silence between us was not awkward, precisely, but it was charged.

I should say something, I thought. But what? I sipped the second cup, racking my brain.

At last, I reached out slowly and touched his nose, where the thin line of the long-healed break pressed white against the skin.

â€œDo you know,â€ I said, â€œyouâ€™ve never told me how you came to break your nose. Who set it for you?â€

â€œOch, that? No one.â€ He smiled, touching his nose a little self-consciously. â€œâ€™Twas only luck that the break was a clean one, for I didna pay it the slightest heed at the time.â€

â€œI suppose not. You saidâ€”â€ I broke off, suddenly recalling what he had said. When I had found him again, in his printerâ€™s shop in Edinburgh, Iâ€™d asked him when heâ€™d broken it. Heâ€™d answered, â€œAbout three minutes after I last saw ye, Sassenach.â€ On the eve of Culloden, thenâ€”on that rocky Scottish hill, below the ring of standing stones.

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ I said a little weakly. â€œYou probably donâ€™t want to think about that, do you?â€

He seized my free hand, hard, and looked down at me.

â€œYou may have it,â€ he said. His voice was very low, but he met my eyes straight on. â€œAll of it. Anything that was ever done to me. If ye wish it, if it helps ye, I will live it through again.â€

â€œOh, God, Jamie,â€ I said softly. â€œNo. I donâ€™t need to know; all I need is to know that you did live through it. That youâ€™re all right. But . . .â€ I hesitated. â€œWill I tell you?â€ What was done to me, I meant, and he knew it. He did glance away then, though he held my hand in both of his, cradling it and rubbing his palm gently over my bruised knuckles.

â€œMust you?â€

â€œI think so. Sometime. But not nowâ€”not unless you . . . you need to hear.â€ I swallowed. â€œFirst.â€

He shook his head, very slightly, but still didnâ€™t look at me.

â€œNot now,â€ he whispered. â€œNot now.â€

I took my hand away, and swallowed the rest of the wine in my cup, rough and warm and musky with the tang of grape skins. I had stopped going hot and cold by turns; now I was only warm throughout, and grateful for it.

â€œYour nose,â€ I said, and poured another cup. â€œTell me, then. Please.â€

He shrugged slightly.

â€œAye, well. There were two English soldiers, come scouting up the hill. I think they didna expect to find anyoneâ€”neither had his musket loaded, or I should haâ€™ died there.â€

He spoke quite casually. A small shiver went over me, but not from cold.

â€œThey saw me, ken, and then one of them saw you, up above. He shouted, and made to go after ye, so I threw myself on him. I didna care at all what happened, so long as ye were safe away, so I went for him bald-heided; plunged my dirk into his side. But his bullet box swung into my way and the knife stuck in it, andâ€”â€ He smiled, lopsided. â€œAnd while I was trying to get it free and keep from beinâ€™ killed, his friend came up and swung the stock of his musket into my face.â€

His free hand had curled up as he spoke, grasping the hilt of a remembered dirk.

I flinched, knowing now exactly what that had felt like. Just hearing about it made my own nose throb. I sniffed, dabbed cautiously at it with the back of my hand, and poured more wine.

â€œHow did you get away?â€

â€œI took the musket from him and clubbed them both to death with it.â€

He spoke quietly, almost colorlessly, but there was an odd resonance to his voice that made my stomach shift uneasily. It was too fresh, that sight of the blood drops gleaming by dawn light in the hairs of his arm. Too fresh, that undertone ofâ€”what was it? satisfaction?â€”in his voice.

I was suddenly too restless to sit still. A moment before I had been so exhausted that my bones were melting; now I had to move. I stood up, leaning out over the sill. The storm was coming; the wind was freshening, blowing back my new-washed hair, and lightning flickered in the distance.

â€œIâ€™m sorry, Sassenach,â€ Jamie said, sounding worried. â€œI shouldna have told ye. Are ye bothered by it?â€

â€œBothered? No, not by that.â€

I spoke a little tersely. Why had I asked him about his nose, of all things? Why now, when I had been content to live in ignorance for the last several years?

â€œWhat bothers ye, then?â€ he asked quietly.

What was bothering me was that the wine had been doing its job of anesthetizing me nicely; now I had ruined it. All the images of the night before were back inside my head, thrown into vivid Technicolor by that simple statement, that oh-so-matter-of-fact, â€œI took the musket from him and clubbed them both to death with it.â€ And its unspoken echo, It is myself who kills for her.

I wanted to throw up. Instead, I gulped more wine, not even tasting it, swallowing it down as fast as I could. I dimly heard Jamie ask again what bothered me, and swung round to glare at him.

â€œWhat bothers meâ€”bothers! What a stupid word! What drives me absolutely mad is that I might have been anyone, anythingâ€”a convenient warm spot with spongy bits to squeezeâ€”God, I was no more than a hole to them!â€

I struck the sill with my fist, then, angered by the impotent little thump of it, picked up my cup, turned round, and hurled it against the wall.

â€œIt wasnâ€™t that way with Black Jack Randall, was it?â€ I demanded. â€œHe knew you, didnâ€™t he? He saw you when he used you; it wouldnâ€™t have been the same if you were anyoneâ€”he wanted you.â€

â€œMy God, ye think that was better?â€ he blurted, and stared at me, eyes wide.

I stopped, panting for breath and feeling dizzy.

â€œNo.â€ I dropped onto the stool and closed my eyes, feeling the room go round and round me, colored lights like a carousel behind my eyes. â€œNo. I donâ€™t. I think Jack Randall was a bloody sociopathic, grade-A pervert, and theseâ€”theseâ€â€”I flipped a hand, unable to think of a suitable wordâ€”â€œthey were just . . . men.â€

I spoke the last word with a sense of loathing evident even to me.

â€œMen,â€ Jamie said, his voice sounding odd.

â€œMen,â€ I said. I opened my eyes and looked at him. My eyes felt hot, and I thought they must glow red, like a possumâ€™s in torchlight.

â€œI have lived through a fucking world war,â€ I said, my voice low and venomous. â€œI have lost a child. I have lost two husbands. I have starved with an army, been beaten and wounded, been patronized, betrayed, imprisoned, and attacked. And I have fucking survived!â€ My voice was rising, but I was helpless to stop it. â€œAnd now should I be shattered because some wretched, pathetic excuses for men stuck their nasty little appendages between my legs and wiggled them?!â€ I stood up, seized the edge of the washstand and heaved it over, sending everything flying with a crashâ€”basin, ewer, and lighted candlestick, which promptly went out.

â€œWell, I wonâ€™t,â€ I said quite calmly.

â€œNasty little appendages?â€ he said, looking rather stunned.

â€œNot yours,â€ I said. â€œI didnâ€™t mean yours. Iâ€™m rather fond of yours.â€ Then I sat down and burst into tears.

His arms came round me, slowly and gently. I didnâ€™t startle or jerk away, and he pressed my head against him, smoothing my damp, tangled hair, his fingers catching in the mass of it.

â€œChrist, ye are a brave wee thing,â€ he murmured.

â€œNot,â€ I said, eyes closed. â€œIâ€™m not.â€ I grabbed his hand and brought it to my lips, closing my eyes as I did so.

I brushed my battered mouth across his knuckles, blind. They were swollen, as bruised as mine; I touched my tongue to his flesh, tasted soap and dust and the silver taste of scrapes and gashesâ€”marks left by bones and broken teeth. Pressed my fingers to the veins beneath the skin of wrist and arm, softly resilient, and the solid lines of the bones beneath. I felt the tributaries of his veins, wished to enter into his bloodstream, travel there, dissolved and bodiless, to take refuge in the thick-walled chambers of his heart. But I couldnâ€™t.

I ran my hand up his sleeve, exploring, clinging, relearning his body. I touched the hair in his oxter and stroked it, surprised at the soft, silky feel of it.

â€œDo you know,â€ I said, â€œI donâ€™t believe Iâ€™ve ever touched you there before?â€

â€œI dinna believe ye have,â€ he said, with a hint of nervous laughter in his voice. â€œI would haâ€™ remembered. Oh!â€ A stipple of gooseflesh burst out over the soft skin there, and I pressed my forehead to his chest.

â€œThe worst of it is,â€ I said, into his shirt, â€œthat I knew them. Each one of them. And Iâ€™ll remember them. And feel guilty that theyâ€™re dead, because of me.â€

â€œNo,â€ he said softly, but very firmly. â€œThey are dead because of me, Sassenach. And because of their own wickedness. If there is guilt, let it rest upon them. Or on me.â€

â€œNot on you alone,â€ I said, my eyes still closed. It was dark in there, and soothing. I could hear my voice, distant but clear, and wondered dimly where the words were coming from. â€œYouâ€™re blood of my blood, bone of my bone. You said so. What you do rests on me, as well.â€

â€œThen may your vow redeem me,â€ he whispered.

He lifted me to my feet and gathered me to him, like a tailor gathering up a length of fragile, heavy silkâ€”slowly, long-fingered, fold upon fold. He carried me then across the room, and laid me gently on the bed, in the light from the flickering fire.



HEâ€™D MEANT TO be gentle. Very gentle. Had planned it with care, worrying each step of the long way home. She was broken; he must go canny, take his time. Be careful in gluing back her shattered bits.

And then he came to her and discovered that she wished no part of gentleness, of courting. She wished directness. Brevity and violence. If she was broken, she would slash him with her jagged edges, reckless as a drunkard with a shattered bottle.

For a moment, two moments, he struggled, trying to hold her close and kiss her tenderly. She squirmed like an eel in his arms, then rolled over him, wriggling and biting.

Heâ€™d thought to ease herâ€”both of themâ€”with the wine. Heâ€™d known she lost all sense of restraint when in drink; he simply hadnâ€™t realized what she was restraining, he thought grimly, trying to seize her without hurting.

He, of all people, should have known. Not fear or grief or painâ€”but rage.

She raked his back; he felt the scrape of broken nails, and thought dimly that was goodâ€”sheâ€™d fought. That was the last of his thought; his own fury took him then, rage and a lust that came on him like black thunder on a mountain, a cloud that hid all from him and him from all, so that kind familiarity was lost and he was alone, strange in darkness.

It might be her neck he grasped, or anyoneâ€™s. The feel of small bones came to him, knobbled in the dark, and the screams of rabbits, killed in his hand. He rose up in a whirlwind, choked with dirt and the scourings of blood.

Wrath boiled and curdled in his balls, and he rode to her spurs. Let his lightning blaze and sear all trace of the intruder from her womb, and if it burnt them both to bone and ashâ€”then let it be.



WHEN SENSE CAME back to him, he lay with his weight full on her, crushing her into the bed. Breath sobbed in his lungs; his hands clenched her arms so hard he felt the bones like sticks about to snap within his grasp.

He had lost himself. Was not sure where his body ended. His mind flailed for a moment, panicked lest it have been unseated altogetherâ€”no. He felt a drop of cold, sudden on his shoulder, and the scattered parts of him drew at once together like shattered bits of quicksilver, to leave him quaking and appalled.

He was still joined to her. He wanted to bolt like a startled quail, but managed to move slowly, loosening his fingers one by one from their death grip on her arms, lifting his body gently away, though the effort of it seemed immense, as though his weight were that of moons and planets. He half-expected to see her crushed and flattened, lifeless on the sheet. But the springy arch of her ribs rose and fell and rose again, roundly reassuring.

Another drop struck him in the back of his neck, and he hunched his shoulders in surprise. Caught by his movement, she looked up, and he met her eyes with shock. She shared it; the shock of strangers meeting one another naked. Her eyes flicked away from his, up toward the ceiling.

â€œThe roofâ€™s leaking,â€ she whispered. â€œThereâ€™s a wet patch.â€

â€œOh.â€ He had not even realized that it was raining. The room was dark with rainlight, though, and the roof thrummed overhead. The sound of it seemed inside his blood, like the beat of the bodhrana inside the night, like the beat of his heart in the forest.

He shuddered, and for lack of any other notion, kissed her forehead. Her arms came up sudden as a snare and held him fiercely, pulling him down onto her again and he seized her, too, crushing her to him hard enough to feel the breath go out of her, unable to let go. He thought vaguely of Briannaâ€™s talk of giant orbs that whirled through space, the thing called gravityâ€”and what was grave about it? He saw that well enough just now: a force so great as to balance some body unthinkably immense in thin air, unsupportedâ€”or send two such bodies crashing into each other, in an explosion of destruction and the smoke of stars.

Heâ€™d bruised her; there were dark red marks on her arms where his fingers had been. They would be black within the day. The marks of other men bloomed black and purple, blue and yellow, clouded petals trapped beneath the whiteness of her skin.

His thighs and buttocks were strained with effort, and a cramp took him hard, making him groan and twist to ease it. His skin was wet; so was hers, and they slid apart with slow reluctance.

Eyes puffed and bruised, clouded like wild honey, inches from his own.

â€œHow do you feel?â€ she asked softly.

â€œTerrible,â€ he replied with complete honesty. He was hoarse, as though he had been screamingâ€”God, perhaps he had been. Her mouth had bled again; there was a red smear on her chin, and the taste of metal from it in his own mouth.

He cleared his throat, wanting to look away from her eyes, but unable to do it. He rubbed a thumb over the smear of blood, clumsily erasing it.

â€œYou?â€ he asked, and the words were like a rasp in his throat. â€œHow do ye feel?â€

She had drawn back a little at his touch, but her eyes were still fixed on his. He had the feeling that she was looking far beyond him, through himâ€”but then the focus of her gaze came back, and she looked directly at him, for the first time since he had brought her home.

â€œSafe,â€ she whispered, and closed her eyes. She took one huge breath and her body relaxed all at once, going limp and heavy like a dying hare.

He held her, both arms wrapped around her as though to save her from drowning, but felt her sink away all the same. He wished to call out to her not to go, not to leave him alone. She vanished into the depths of sleep, and he yearned after her, wishing her healed, fearing her flight, and bent his head, burying his face in her hair and her scent.

The wind banged the open shutters as it passed, and in the dark outside, one owl hooted and another answered, hiding from the rain.

Then he cried, soundless, muscles strained to aching that he might not shake with it, that she might not wake to know it. He wept to emptiness and ragged breath, the pillow wet beneath his face. Then lay exhausted beyond the thought of tiredness, too far from sleep even to recall what it was like. His only comfort was the small, so fragile weight that lay warm upon his heart, breathing.

Then her hands rose and rested on him, the tears cool on his face, congealing, the white of her clean as the silent snow that covers char and blood and breathes peace upon the world.

THE CAPTIVE




IT WAS A STILL, WARM morning; the last of the Indian summer. A woodpecker hammered in the wood nearby, and some insect was making a noise like rasping metal in the tall grass beyond the house. I came downstairs slowly, feeling mildly disembodiedâ€”and wishing I were, since the body I had hurt almost everywhere.

Mrs. Bug hadnâ€™t come this morning; perhaps she wasnâ€™t feeling well. Or perhaps she wasnâ€™t sure yet how to deal with seeing me, or what to say to me when she did. My mouth tightened a little, something I realized only because the partially healed split in my lip stung when I did it.

I very consciously relaxed my face and went about getting down the coffee things from the kitchen shelf. There was a trail of tiny black ants running along the edge of the shelf, and a swarm of them over the small tin box in which I kept lump sugar. I flicked them off with a few stern swipes of my apron, and made a mental note to see about finding some avens root for repellant.

That resolve, small as it was, made me feel better and steadier at once. Ever since Hodgepile and his men had turned up at the malting shed, I had been completely at the mercy of someone else, prevented from any sort of independent action. For the first time in daysâ€”it seemed much longerâ€”I was able to decide what I was going to do. It seemed a precious liberty.

Very well, I thought. What would I do, then? I would . . . drink some coffee. Eat a bit of toast? No. I felt gingerly with my tongue; several teeth on one side were loose, and my jaw muscles so sore that serious chewing was out of the question. Just coffee, then, and while I drank it, I would decide upon the shape of my day.

Feeling pleased with this plan, I put back the plain wooden cup, and instead ceremoniously set out my sole china cup and saucer, a delicate bit of porcelain Jocasta had given me, hand-painted with violets.

Jamie had poked up the fire earlier and the kettle was boiling; I dipped out enough water to warm the pot, swished it round, and opened the back door in order to toss it out. Fortunately, I looked first.

Ian was sitting cross-legged on the back porch, a small whetstone in one hand, knife in the other.

â€œGood morn to ye, Auntie,â€ he said cheerfully, and drew the knife across the stone, making the thin, monotonous rasping noise I had heard earlier. â€œFeeling better, then?â€

â€œYes, fine,â€ I assured him. He raised one eyebrow dubiously, looking me over.

â€œWell, better than ye look, I hope.â€

â€œNot that good,â€ I said tartly, and he laughed. He put down the knife and stone and got to his feet. He was much taller than I; nearly Jamieâ€™s height, though thinner. Heâ€™d inherited his fatherâ€™s whipcord leanness, as well as the elder Ianâ€™s sense of humorâ€”and his toughness.

He took me by the shoulders and turned me into the sunlight, pursing his lips a little as he inspected me at close range. I blinked up at him, imagining what I must look like. I hadnâ€™t had the nerve to look into a mirror yet, but I knew the bruising must be going from blacks and reds to a colorful assortment of blues, greens, and yellows. Add in assorted knobbly swellings, flecks of crusty black for the split lip and the scabby bits, and I was undoubtedly quite the picture of health.

Ianâ€™s soft hazel eyes peered intently into my face with no apparent surprise or distress, though. At last he let go, and patted my shoulder gently.

â€œYeâ€™ll do, Auntie,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s still you, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œYes,â€ I said. And with no warning at all, tears welled up and overflowed. I knew exactly what heâ€™d meant, and why heâ€™d said itâ€”and it was true.

I felt as though my center had turned unexpectedly to liquid and was gushing out, not from grief, but from relief. I was still me. Fragile, battered, sore, and waryâ€”but myself. Only when I recognized that, did I realize how much I had feared that I might not beâ€”that I might emerge from shock and find myself irrevocably altered, some vital part forever missing.

â€œIâ€™m all right,â€ I assured Ian, hastily wiping my eyes with the edge of my apron. â€œJust a bitâ€”â€

â€œAye, I know,â€ he said, and took the pot from me, tossing the water into the grass by the path. â€œItâ€™s a bit strange, aye? Coming back.â€

I took the coffeepot from him, squeezing his hand hard as I did so. He had come back twice from captivity: rescued from Geillis Duncanâ€™s strange compound on Jamaica, only to choose later exile with the Mohawk. He had come to manhood on that journey, and I did wonder what parts of himself might have been left behind on the way.

â€œDo you want breakfast, Ian?â€ I asked, sniffing and dabbing gingerly at my swollen nose.

â€œOf course I do,â€ he said, grinning. â€œCome and sit yourself down, Auntieâ€”Iâ€™ll fetch it.â€

I followed him inside, filled the coffeepot and set it to brew, then sat at the table, the sun on my back through the open door, and watched as Ian rummaged the pantry. My mind felt soggy and incapable of thought, but a sense of peace crept over me, gentle as the wavering light through the chestnut trees. Even the small throbbings here and there seemed pleasant, a sense of healing being quietly accomplished.

Ian spread an armload of random foodstuffs on the table and sat down across from me.

â€œAll right, Auntie?â€ he asked again, raising one of his fatherâ€™s feathery eyebrows.

â€œYes. Itâ€™s rather like sitting on a soap bubble, though. Isnâ€™t it?â€ I glanced at him as I poured the coffee, but he looked down at the chunk of bread he was buttering. I thought a slight smile touched his lips, but couldnâ€™t tell for sure.

â€œSomething like,â€ he said quietly.

The heat of the coffee warmed my hands through the china, and soothed the raw membranes of my nose and palate. I felt as though I had been screaming for hours, but didnâ€™t recall actually doing any such thing. Had I, with Jamie the night before?

I didnâ€™t quite want to think about the night before; it was part of the soap-bubble feeling. Jamie had been gone when I woke, and I wasnâ€™t sure whether I was glad or sorry about that.

Ian didnâ€™t talk, but ate his way in a businesslike manner through half a loaf with butter and honey, three raisin muffins, two thick slices of ham, and a jug of milk. Jamie had done the milking, I saw; he always used the blue jug, while Mr. Wemyss used the white one. I wondered vaguely where Mr. Wemyss wasâ€”I hadnâ€™t seen him, and the house felt emptyâ€”but didnâ€™t really care. It occurred to me that perhaps Jamie had told both Mr. Wemyss and Mrs. Bug to stay away for a bit, feeling that I might need a little time alone.

â€œMore coffee, Auntie?â€

At my nod, Ian rose from the table, reached down the decanter from the shelf, and poured a large slug of whisky into my cup before refilling it.

â€œMam always said itâ€™s good for what ails ye,â€ he said.

â€œYour mother is right. Do you want some?â€

He sniffed at the aromatic fumes, but shook his head.

â€œNo, I think not, Auntie. I must have a clear head this morning.â€

â€œReally? Why?â€ The porridge in the pot wasnâ€™t nine days oldâ€”quiteâ€”but it had been there for three or four. Of course; no one had been here to eat it. I eyed the cementlike glob adhering to my spoon critically, then decided that it was still soft enough to eat, and doused it with honey.

Ian was dealing with a mouthful of the same substance, and took a moment to clear it from his palate before replying.

â€œUncle Jamie means to ask his questions,â€ he answered, giving me a cautious glance as he reached for the bread.

â€œDoes he?â€ I said, rather blankly, but before I could inquire what he meant by that, the sound of footsteps on the path announced the arrival of Fergus.

He looked as though he had been sleeping in the woodsâ€”well, of course, I thought, he had been. Or rather, not sleeping; the men had barely stopped to rest in their pursuit of Hodgepileâ€™s gang. Fergus had shaved, but his normally fastidious grooming was sadly lacking, and his handsome face was gaunt, the deep eyes shadowed.

â€œMilady,â€ he murmured, and unexpectedly bent to kiss my cheek, hand on my shoulder. â€œComment Ã§a va?â€

â€œTres bien, merci,â€ I replied, smiling gingerly. â€œHow are Marsali and the children? And our hero, Germain?â€ I had asked Jamie about Marsali on the way back, and had been assured that she was all right. Germain, monkey that he was, had gone straight up a tree when he heard Hodgepileâ€™s men approaching. He had seen everything from his perch, and as soon as the men departed, had scrambled down, dragged his semiconscious mother away from the fire, and run for help.

â€œAh, Germain,â€ Fergus said, a faint smile momentarily lifting the shadows of fatigue. â€œNous pâ€™tit guerrier. He says GrandpÃ¨re has promised him a pistol of his own, to shoot bad people with.â€

GrandpÃ¨re undoubtedly meant it, I reflected. Germain couldnâ€™t manage a musket, being somewhat shorter than the gun itselfâ€”but a pistol would do. In my present state of mind, the fact that Germain was only six didnâ€™t seem particularly important.

â€œHave you had breakfast, Fergus?â€ I pushed the pot toward him.

â€œNon. Merci.â€ He helped himself to cold biscuit, ham, and coffee, though I noticed that he ate without much appetite.

We all sat quietly, sipping coffee and listening to the birds. Carolina wrens had built a late nest under the eaves of the house and the parent birds swooped in and out, just above our heads. I could hear the high-pitched cheeping of the nestlings begging, and saw a scatter of twigs and a bit of empty eggshell on the floorboards of the porch. They were nearly ready to fledge; just in time, before the real cold weather came.

The sight of the brown-speckled eggshell reminded me of Monsieur le Oeuf. Yes, thatâ€™s what I would do, I decided, with a small sense of relief at having something firm in mind. I would go and see Marsali later. And perhaps Mrs. Bug, as well.

â€œDid you see Mrs. Bug this morning?â€ I asked, turning to Ian. His cabinâ€”little more than a brush-roofed lean-toâ€”lay just beyond the Bugsâ€™; he would have passed them on his way to the house.

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said, looking a little surprised. â€œShe was sweeping out as I went by. Offered me breakfast, but I said Iâ€™d eat here. I kent Uncle Jamie had a ham, aye?â€ He grinned, lifting his fourth ham biscuit in illustration.

â€œSo sheâ€™s all right? I thought she might be ill; she usually comes quite early.â€

Ian nodded, and took an enormous bite of the biscuit.

â€œAye, I expect sheâ€™s busy, minding the ciomach.â€

My fragile sense of well-being cracked like the wrensâ€™ eggs. A ciomach was a captive. In my soggy-minded euphoria, I had somehow managed to forget Lionel Brownâ€™s existence.

Ianâ€™s remark that Jamie meant to ask questions this morning dropped suddenly into contextâ€”as did Fergusâ€™s presence. And the knife Ian had been sharpening.

â€œWhere is Jamie?â€ I asked, rather faintly. â€œHave you seen him?â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ Ian said, looking surprised. He swallowed, and gestured toward the door with his chin. â€œHeâ€™s just out in the woodshed, makinâ€™ new shingles. He says the roofâ€™s sprung a leak.â€

No sooner had he said this than the sound of hammering came from the roof, far above. Of course, I thought. First things first. But then, I supposed Lionel Brown wasnâ€™t going anywhere, after all.

â€œPerhaps . . . I should go and see Mr. Brown,â€ I said, swallowing.

Ian and Fergus exchanged glances.

â€œNo, Auntie, ye shouldnâ€™t,â€ Ian said quite calmly, but with an air of authority I wasnâ€™t accustomed to seeing in him.

â€œWhatever do you mean?â€ I stared at him, but he merely went on eating, though a trifle more slowly.

â€œMilord says you should not,â€ Fergus amplified, drizzling a spoonful of honey into his coffee.

â€œHe says what?â€ I asked incredulously.

Neither of them would look at me, but they seemed to draw together, emanating a reluctant sort of stubborn resistance. Either one would do anything I asked, I knewâ€”except defy Jamie. If Jamie thought I ought not to see Mr. Brown, I wasnâ€™t going to do it with the assistance of either Ian or Fergus.

I dropped the spoon back into my bowl of porridge, uneaten lumps still adhering to it.

â€œDid he happen to mention why he thinks I ought not to visit Mr. Brown?â€ I asked calmly, under the circumstances.

Both men looked surprised, then exchanged another look, this one longer.

â€œNo, milady,â€ Fergus said, his voice carefully neutral.

There was a brief silence, during which both of them seemed to be considering. Then Fergus glanced at Ian, deferring to him with a shrug.

â€œWell, dâ€™ye see, Auntie,â€ Ian said carefully, â€œwe do mean to question the fellow.â€

â€œAnd we will have answers,â€ Fergus said, eyes on the spoon with which he was stirring his coffee.

â€œAnd when Uncle Jamie is satisfied that he has told us what he can . . .â€

Ian had laid his newly sharpened knife on the table beside his plate. He picked it up, and thoughtfully drew it down the length of a cold sausage, which promptly split open, with an aromatic burst of sage and garlic. He looked up then, and met my eyes directly. And I realized that while I might still be meâ€”Ian was no longer the boy he used to be. Not at all.

â€œYouâ€™ll kill him, then?â€ I said, my lips feeling numb in spite of the hot coffee.

â€œOh, yes,â€ Fergus said very softly. â€œI expect that we shall.â€ He met my eyes now, too. There was a bleak, grim look about him, and his deep-set eyes were hard as stone.

â€œHeâ€”itâ€”I mean . . . it wasnâ€™t him,â€ I said. â€œIt couldnâ€™t have been. Heâ€™d already broken his leg whenâ€”â€ I didnâ€™t seem to have enough air to finish my sentences. â€œAnd Marsali. It wasnâ€™tâ€”I donâ€™t think he . . .â€

Something behind Ianâ€™s eyes changed, as he grasped my meaning. His lips pressed tight for a moment, and he nodded.

â€œAs well for him, then,â€ he said shortly.

â€œAs well,â€ Fergus echoed, â€œbut I think it will not matter in the end. We killed the othersâ€”why should he live?â€ He pushed back from the table, leaving his coffee undrunk. â€œI think I will go, cousin.â€

â€œAye? Iâ€™ll come too, then.â€ Ian shoved his plate away, nodding to me. â€œWill ye tell Uncle Jamie weâ€™ve gone ahead, Auntie?â€

I nodded numbly, and watched them go, vanishing one after the other under the big chestnut tree that overhung the trail leading to the Bugsâ€™ cabin. Mechanically, I got up and began slowly to clear away the remains of the makeshift breakfast.

I really wasnâ€™t sure whether I minded a lot about Mr. Brown or not. On the one hand, I did disapprove on principle of torture and cold-blooded murder. On the other . . . while it was true enough that Brown had not personally violated or injured me, and he had tried to make Hodgepile release meâ€”heâ€™d been all in favor of killing me, later. And I hadnâ€™t the slightest doubt that he would have drowned me in the gorge, had Tebbe not intervened.

No, I thought, carefully rinsing my cup and drying it on my apron, perhaps I didnâ€™t really mind terribly about Mr. Brown.

Still, I felt uneasy and upset. What I did mind about, I realized, were Ian and Fergus. And Jamie. The fact was, killing someone in the heat of battle is a quite different thing from executing a man, and I knew that. Did they?

Well, Jamie did.

â€œAnd may your vow redeem me.â€ He had whispered that to me, the night before. It was just about the last thing I recalled him saying, in fact. Well, all right; but I would greatly prefer that he didnâ€™t feel in need of redemption to start with. And as for Ian and Fergus . . .

Fergus had fought in the Battle of Prestonpans, at the age of ten. I still remembered the face of the small French orphan, soot-smeared and dazed with shock and exhaustion, looking down at me from his perch atop a captured cannon. â€œI killed an English soldier, madame,â€ heâ€™d said to me. â€œHe fell down and I stuck him with my knife.â€

And Ian, a fifteen-year-old, weeping in remorse because he thought he had accidentally killed an intruder to Jamieâ€™s Edinburgh print shop. God knew what he had done, since; he wasnâ€™t talking. I had a sudden vision of Fergusâ€™s hook, dark with blood, and Ian, silhouetted in the dark. â€œAnd I,â€ heâ€™d said, echoing Jamie. â€œIt is myself who kills for her.â€

It was 1773. And on the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five . . . the shot heard round the world was already being loaded. The room was warm, but I shuddered convulsively. What in the name of God did I think I could shield them from? Any of them.

A sudden roar from the roof above startled me out of my thoughts.

I walked out into the dooryard and looked up, shading my eyes against the morning sun. Jamie was sitting astride the rooftree, rocking to and fro over one hand, which he held curled into his belly.

â€œWhatâ€™s going on up there?â€ I called.

â€œIâ€™ve got a splinter,â€ came the terse answer, obviously spoken through clenched teeth.

I wanted to laugh, if only as small escape from tension, but didnâ€™t.

â€œWell, come down, then. Iâ€™ll pull it out.â€

â€œIâ€™m no finished!â€

â€œI donâ€™t care!â€ I said, suddenly impatient with him. â€œCome down this minute. I want to talk to you.â€

A bag of nails hit the grass with a sudden clank, followed instantly by the hammer.

First things first, then.



TECHNICALLY, I SUPPOSED, it was a splinter. It was a two-inch sliver of cedarwood, and heâ€™d driven it completely under the nail of his middle finger, nearly to the first joint.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ!â€

â€œAye,â€ he agreed, looking a little pale. â€œYe might say that.â€

The protruding stub was too short to grip with my fingers. I hauled him into the surgery and jerked the sliver out with forceps, before one could say Jack Robinson. Jamie was saying a good deal more than Jack Robinsonâ€”mostly in French, which is an excellent language for swearing.

â€œYouâ€™re going to lose that nail,â€ I observed, submerging the offended digit in a small bowl of alcohol and water. Blood bloomed from it like ink from a squid.

â€œTo hell wiâ€™ the nail,â€ he said, gritting his teeth. â€œCut the whole bloody finger off and haâ€™ done with it! Merde dâ€™chevre!â€

â€œThe Chinese used toâ€”well, no, I suppose they still do, come to think of itâ€”shove splinters of bamboo under peopleâ€™s fingernails to make them talk.â€

â€œChrist! Tu me casses les couilles!â€

â€œObviously a very effective technique,â€ I said, lifting his hand out of the bowl and wrapping the finger tightly in a strip of linen. â€œWere you trying it out, before using it on Lionel Brown?â€ I tried to speak lightly, keeping my eyes on his hand. I felt his own gaze fix on me, and he snorted.

â€œWhat in the name of saints and archangels was wee Ian telling ye, Sassenach?â€

â€œThat you meant to question the manâ€”and get answers.â€

â€œI do, and I shall,â€ he said shortly. â€œSo?â€

â€œFergus and Ian seemed to think thatâ€”you might be moved to use any means necessary,â€ I said with some delicacy. â€œTheyâ€™re more than willing to help.â€

â€œI imagine they are.â€ The first agony had abated somewhat. He breathed more deeply, and color was beginning to come back into his face. â€œFergus has a right. It was his wife attacked.â€

â€œIan seemed . . .â€ I hesitated, searching for the right word. Ian had seemed so calm as to be terrifying. â€œYou didnâ€™t call Roger to help with theâ€”the questioning?â€

â€œNo. Not yet.â€ One corner of his mouth tucked in. â€œRoger Macâ€™s a good fighter, but no the sort to scare a man, save heâ€™s truly roused. Heâ€™s no deceit in him at all.â€

â€œWhereas you, Ian, and Fergus . . .â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said dryly. â€œWily as snakes, the lot of us. Yeâ€™ve only to look at Roger Mac to see how safe their time must be, him and the lass. A bit of a comfort, that,â€ he added, the tuck growing deeper. â€œTo ken things will get better, I mean.â€

I could see that he was trying to change the subject, which was not a good sign. I made a small snorting noise, but it hurt my nose.

â€œAnd youâ€™re not truly roused, is that what youâ€™re telling me?â€

He made a much more successful snorting noise, but didnâ€™t reply. He tilted his head to one side, watching as I laid out a square of gauze and began to rub dried leaves of comfrey into it. I didnâ€™t know how to say what was troubling me, but he plainly saw that something was.

â€œWill you kill him?â€ I asked baldly, keeping my eyes on the jar of honey. It was made of brown glass, and the light glowed through it as though it were a huge ball of clear amber.

Jamie sat still, watching me. I could feel his speculative gaze, though I didnâ€™t look up.

â€œI think so,â€ he said.

My hands had started to tremble, and I pressed them on the surface of the table to still them.

â€œNot today,â€ he added. â€œIf I kill him, I shall do it properly.â€

I wasnâ€™t sure I wanted to know what constituted a proper killing, in his opinion, but he told me anyway.

â€œIf he dies at my hand, it will be in the open, before witnesses who ken the truth of the matter, and him standing upright. I willna have it said that I killed a helpless man, whatever his crime.â€

â€œOh.â€ I swallowed, feeling mildly ill, and took a pinch of powdered bloodroot to add to the salve I was making. It had a faint, astringent smell, which seemed to help. â€œButâ€”you might let him live?â€

â€œPerhaps. I suppose I might ransom him to his brotherâ€”depending.â€

â€œDo you know, you sound quite like your uncle Colum. He would have thought it through like that.â€

â€œDo I?â€ The corner of his mouth turned up slightly. â€œShall I take that as compliment, Sassenach?â€

â€œI suppose you might as well.â€

â€œAye, well,â€ he said thoughtfully. The stiff fingers tapped on the tabletop, and he winced slightly as the movement jarred the injured one. â€œColum had a castle. And armed clansmen at his beck. I should have some difficulty in defending this house against a raid, perhaps.â€

â€œThatâ€™s what you mean by â€˜dependingâ€™?â€ I felt quite uneasy at this; the thought of armed raiders attacking the house had not occurred to meâ€”and I saw that Jamieâ€™s forethought in storing Mr. Brown off our premises had perhaps not been entirely for the purpose of sparing my sensibilities.

â€œOne of the things.â€

I mixed a bit of honey with my powdered herbs, then scooped a small dollop of purified bear grease into the mortar.

â€œI suppose,â€ I said, eyes on my mixing, â€œthat thereâ€™s no point in turning Lionel Brown over to theâ€”the authorities?â€

â€œWhich authorities did ye have in mind, Sassenach?â€ he asked dryly.

A good question. This part of the backcountry had not yet formed nor joined a county, though a movement was afoot to that purpose. Were Jamie to deliver Mr. Brown to the sheriff of the nearest county for trial . . . well, no, perhaps not a good idea. Brownsville lay just within the borders of the nearest county, and the current sheriff was in fact named Brown.

I bit my lip, considering. In times of stress, I tended still to respond as what I wasâ€”a civilized Englishwoman, accustomed to rely on the sureties of government and law. Well, all right, Jamie had a point; the twentieth century had its own dangers, but some things had improved. This was nearly 1774, though, and the colonial government was already showing cracks and fault lines, signs of the collapse to come.

â€œI suppose we could take him to Cross Creek.â€ Farquard Campbell was a justice of the peace thereâ€”and a friend to Jamieâ€™s aunt, Jocasta Cameron. â€œOr to New Bern.â€ Governor Martin and the bulk of the Royal Council were in New Bernâ€”three hundred miles away. â€œMaybe Hillsborough?â€ That was the center of the Circuit Court.

â€œMmphm.â€

This noise denoted a marked disinclination to lose several weeksâ€™ work in order to haul Mr. Brown before any of these seats of justice, let alone entrust a matter of importance to the highly unreliableâ€”and frequently corruptâ€”judicial system. I looked up and met his eye, humorous but bleak. If I responded as what I was, so did Jamie.

And Jamie was a Highland laird, accustomed to follow his own laws, and fight his own battles.

â€œButâ€”â€ I began.

â€œSassenach,â€ he said quite gently. â€œWhat of the others?â€

The others. I stopped moving, paralyzed by the sudden memory: a large band of black figures, coming out of the wood with the sun behind them. But that group had split in two, intending to meet again in Brownsville, in three daysâ€™ timeâ€”today, in fact.

For the moment, presumably no one from Brownsville yet knew what had happenedâ€”that Hodgepile and his men were dead, or that Lionel Brown was now a captive on the Ridge. Given the speed with which news spread in the mountains, though, it would be public knowledge within a week.

In the aftermath of shock, I had somehow overlooked the fact that there were still a number of bandits at largeâ€”and while I didnâ€™t know who they were, they knew both who I was and where I was. Would they realize that I could not identify them? Or be willing to take that risk?

Obviously, Jamie was not willing to take the risk of leaving the Ridge to escort Lionel Brown anywhere, whether or not he decided to let the man live.

The thought of the others had brought something important back to me, though. It might not be the best time to mention it, but then again, there wasnâ€™t going to be a good one.

I took a deep breath, squaring myself for it.

â€œJamie.â€

The tone of my voice jerked him immediately from whatever heâ€™d been thinking; he looked sharply at me, one eyebrow raised.

â€œIâ€”I have to tell you something.â€

He paled a little, but reached out at once, grasping my hand. He took a deep breath of his own, and nodded.

â€œAye.â€

â€œOh,â€ I said, realizing that he thought I meant that I had suddenly arrived at a point where I needed to tell him the grisly details of my experiences. â€œNotâ€”not that. Not exactly.â€ I squeezed his hand, though, and held on, while I told him about Donner.

â€œAnother,â€ he said. He sounded slightly stunned. â€œAnother one?â€

â€œAnother,â€ I confirmed. â€œThe thing is . . . I, um, I donâ€™t remember seeing him . . . seeing him dead.â€ The eerie sense of that dawn returned to me. I had very sharp, distinct memoriesâ€”but they were disjointed, so fractured as to bear no relation to the whole. An ear. I remembered an ear, thick and cup-shaped as a woodland fungus. It was shaded in the most exquisite tones of purple, brown, and indigo, shadowed in the carved whorls of the inner parts, nearly translucent at the rim; perfect in the light of a sunbeam that cut through the fronds of a hemlock to touch it.

I recalled that ear so perfectly that I could almost reach into my memory and touch it myselfâ€”but I had no idea whose ear it had been. Was the hair that lay behind it brown, black, reddish, straight, wavy, gray? And the face . . . I didnâ€™t know. If I had looked, I hadnâ€™t seen.

He shot me a sharp look.

â€œAnd ye think heâ€™s maybe not.â€

â€œMaybe not.â€ I swallowed the taste of dust, pine needles, and blood, and breathed the comforting fresh scent of buttermilk. â€œI warned him, you see. I told him you were coming, and that he didnâ€™t want you to find him with me. When you attacked the campâ€”he might have run. He struck me as a coward, certainly. But I donâ€™t know.â€

He nodded, and sighed heavily.

â€œCan you . . . recall, do you think?â€ I asked hesitantly. â€œWhen you showed me the dead. Did you look at them?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said softly. â€œI wasna looking at anything save you.â€

His eyes had been on our linked hands. He raised them now, and looked at my face, troubled and searching. I lifted his hand and laid my cheek against his knuckles, closing my eyes for an instant.

â€œIâ€™ll be all right,â€ I said. â€œThe thing isâ€”â€ I said, and stopped.

â€œAye?â€

â€œIf he did runâ€”where do you suppose heâ€™d go?â€

He closed his own eyes and drew a deep breath.

â€œTo Brownsville,â€ he said, in resignation. â€œAnd if he did, Richard Brown kens already whatâ€™s become of Hodgepile and his menâ€”and likely thinks his brother is dead, as well.â€

â€œOh.â€ I swallowed, and changed the subject slightly.

â€œWhy did you tell Ian I wasnâ€™t to be allowed to see Mr. Brown?â€

â€œI didna say that. But I think it best if ye dinna see him, that much is true.â€

â€œBecause?â€

â€œBecause yeâ€™ve an oath upon you,â€ he said, sounding mildly surprised that I didnâ€™t understand immediately. â€œCan ye see a man injured, and leave him to suffer?â€

The ointment was ready. I unwrapped his finger, which had stopped bleeding, and tamped as much of the salve under the damaged nail as I could manage.

â€œProbably not,â€ I said, eyes on my work. â€œBut whyâ€”â€

â€œIf ye mend him, care for himâ€”and then I decide he must die?â€ His eyes rested on me, questioning. â€œHow would that be for ye?â€

â€œWell, that would be a bit awkward,â€ I said, taking a deep breath to steady myself. I wrapped a thin strip of linen around the nail and tied it neatly. â€œStill, though . . .â€

â€œYe wish to care for him? Why?â€ He sounded curious, but not angry. â€œIs your oath so strong, then?â€

â€œNo.â€ I put both hands on the table to brace myself; my knees seemed suddenly weak.

â€œBecause Iâ€™m glad theyâ€™re dead,â€ I whispered, looking down. My hands were raw, and I fumbled while I worked because my fingers were still swollen; there were deep purple marks still sunk in the skin of my wrists. â€œAnd I am very muchâ€”â€ What? Afraid; afraid of the men, afraid of myself. Thrilled, in a horrible sort of way. â€œAshamed,â€ I said. â€œTerribly ashamed.â€ I glanced up at him. â€œI hate it.â€

He held out his hand to me, waiting. He knew better than to touch me; I couldnâ€™t have borne being touched just then. I didnâ€™t take it, not at once, though I longed to. I looked away, speaking rapidly to Adso, who had materialized on the countertop and was regarding me with a bottomless green gaze.

â€œIf Iâ€”I keep thinking . . . if I were to see him, help himâ€”Christ, I donâ€™t want to, I donâ€™t at all! But if I couldâ€”perhaps that would . . . help somehow.â€ I looked up then, feeling haunted. â€œMake . . . amends.â€

â€œFor being glad they are deadâ€”and for wanting him dead, too?â€ Jamie suggested gently.

I nodded, feeling as though a small, heavy weight had lifted with the speaking of the words. I didnâ€™t remember taking his hand, but it was tight on mine. Blood from his finger was seeping through the fresh bandage, but he paid no attention.

â€œDo you want to kill him?â€ I asked.

He looked at me for a long moment before replying.

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said very softly. â€œBut for now, his life is surety for yours. For all of us, perhaps. And so he lives. For now. But I will ask questionsâ€”and I shall have answers.â€



I SAT IN MY SURGERY for some time after he left. Emerging slowly from shock, I had felt safe, surrounded by home and friends, by Jamie. Now I must come to grips with the fact that nothing was safeâ€”not I, not home nor friendsâ€”and certainly not Jamie.

â€œBut then, you never are, are you, you bloody Scot?â€ I said aloud, and laughed, weakly.

Feeble as it was, it made me feel better. I rose with sudden decision and began to tidy my cupboards, lining up bottles in order of size, sweeping out bits of scattered herbs, throwing away solutions gone stale or suspect.

I had meant to go and visit Marsali, but Fergus had told me during breakfast that Jamie had sent her with the children and Lizzie to stay with the McGillivrays, where she would be cared for, and safe. If there was safety in numbers, the McGillivraysâ€™ house was certainly the place for it.

Located near Woolamâ€™s Creek, the McGillivraysâ€™ home place adjoined Ronnie Sinclairâ€™s cooperâ€™s shop, and enclosed a seething mass of cordial humanity, including not only Robin and Ute McGillivray, their son, Manfred, and their daughter Senga, but also Ronnie, who boarded with them. The usual mob scene was augmented intermittently by Senga McGillivrayâ€™s fiancÃ©, Heinrich Strasse, and his German relatives from Salem, and by Inga and Hilda, their husbands and children, and their husbandsâ€™ relatives.

Add in the men who congregated daily in Ronnieâ€™s shop, a convenient stopping place on the road to and from Woolamâ€™s Mill, and likely no one would even notice Marsali and her family, in the midst of that mob. Surely no one would seek to harm her there. But for me to go and see her . . .

Highland tact and delicacy were one thing. Highland hospitality and curiosity were another. If I stayed peacefully at home, I would likely be left in peaceâ€”at least for a while. If I were to set foot near the McGillivraysâ€™ . . . I blenched at the thought, and hastily decided that perhaps I would visit Marsali tomorrow. Or the next day. Jamie had assured me she was all right, only shocked and bruised.

The house stood around me in peace. No modern background of furnace, fans, plumbing, refrigerators. No whoosh of pilot lights or hum of compressors. Just the occasional creak of beam or floorboard, and the odd muffled scrape of a wood wasp building its nest up under the eaves.

I looked round the ordered world of my surgeryâ€”ranks of shining jars and bottles, linen screens laden with drying arrowroot and masses of lavender, bunches of nettle and yarrow and rosemary hanging overhead. The bottle of ether, sunlight glowing on it. Adso curled on the countertop, tail neatly tucked around his feet, eyes half-closed in purring contemplation.

Home. A small shiver ran down my spine. I wanted nothing more than to be alone, safe and alone, in my own home.

Safe. I had a day, perhaps two, in which home would still be safe. And then . . .

I realized that I had been standing still for some moments, staring blankly into a box of yellow nightshade berries, round and shiny as marbles. Very poisonous, and a slow and painful death. My eyes rose to the etherâ€”quick and merciful. If Jamie did decide to kill Lionel Brown . . . But no. In the open, heâ€™d said, standing on his feet before witnesses. Slowly, I closed the box and put it back on the shelf.

What then?



THERE WERE ALWAYS chores that could be doneâ€”but nothing pressing, with no one clamoring to be fed, clothed, or cared for. Feeling quite odd, I wandered round the house for a bit, and finally went into Jamieâ€™s study, where I poked among the books on the shelf there, settling at last on Henry Fieldingâ€™s Tom Jones.

I couldnâ€™t think how long it had been since I had read a novel. And in the daytime! Feeling pleasantly wicked, I sat by the open window in my surgery and resolutely entered a world far from my own.

I lost track of time, moving only to brush away roving insects that came through the window, or to absently scratch Adsoâ€™s head when he nudged against me. Occasional thoughts of Jamie and Lionel Brown drifted through the back of my mind, but I shooed them away like the leafhoppers and midges who landed on my page, drifting in through the window. Whatever was happening in the Bugsâ€™ cabin had happened, or would happenâ€”I simply couldnâ€™t think about it. As I read, the soap bubble formed around me once more, filled with perfect stillness.

The sun was halfway down the sky before faint pangs of hunger began to stir. It was as I looked up, rubbing my forehead and wondering vaguely whether there was any ham left, that I saw a man standing in the doorway to the surgery.

I shrieked, and leaped to my feet, sending Henry Fielding flying.

â€œYour pardon, mistress!â€ Thomas Christie blurted, looking nearly as startled as I felt. â€œI didna realize that youâ€™d not heard me.â€

â€œNo. Iâ€”Iâ€”was reading.â€ I gestured foolishly toward the book on the floor. My heart was pounding, and blood surged to and fro in my body, seemingly at random, so that my face flushed, my ears throbbed, and my hands tingled, all out of control.

He stooped and picked the book up, smoothing its cover with the careful attitude of one who values books, though the volume itself was battered, its cover scarred with rings where wet glasses or bottles had been set down upon it. Jamie had got it from the owner of an ordinary in Cross Creek, in partial trade for a load of firewood; some customer had left it, months before.

â€œIs there no one here to care for you?â€ he asked, frowning as he looked around. â€œShall I go and fetch my daughter to you?â€

â€œNo. I meanâ€”I donâ€™t need anyone. Iâ€™m quite all right. What about you?â€ I asked quickly, forestalling any further expressions of concern on his part. He glanced at my face, then hastily away. Eyes fixed carefully in the vicinity of my collarbone, he laid the book on the table and held out his right hand, wrapped in a cloth.

â€œI beg your pardon, mistress. I wouldna intrude, save . . .â€

I was already unwrapping the hand. Heâ€™d ripped the incision in his right handâ€”probably, I realized with a small tightening of the belly, in the course of the fight with the bandits. The wound was no great matter, but there were bits of dirt and debris in the wound, and the edges were red and gaping, raw surfaces clouded with a film of pus.

â€œYou should have come at once,â€ I said, though with no tone of rebuke. I knew perfectly well why he hadnâ€™tâ€”and in fact, I should have been in no state to deal with him, if he had.

He shrugged slightly, but didnâ€™t bother replying. I sat him down and went to fetch things. Luckily, there was some of the antiseptic salve left that Iâ€™d made for Jamieâ€™s splinter. That, a quick alcohol wash, clean bandage . . .

He was turning the pages of Tom Jones slowly, lips pursed in concentration. Evidently Henry Fielding would do as anesthetic for the job at hand; I shouldnâ€™t need to fetch a Bible.

â€œDo you read novels?â€ I asked, meaning no rudeness, but merely surprised that he might countenance anything so frivolous.

He hesitated. â€œYes. Iâ€”yes.â€ He took a very deep breath as I submerged his hand in the bowl, but it contained only water, soaproot, and a very small amount of alcohol, and he let the breath go with a sigh.

â€œHave you read Tom Jones before?â€ I asked, making conversation to relax him.

â€œNot precisely, though I know the story. My wifeâ€”â€

He stopped abruptly. Heâ€™d never mentioned his wife before; I supposed that it was sheer relief at not experiencing agony yet that had made him talkative. He seemed to realize that he must complete the sentence, though, and went on, reluctantly. â€œMy wife . . . read novels.â€

â€œDid she?â€ I murmured, setting about the job of debridement. â€œDid she like them?â€

â€œI suppose that she must have.â€

There was something odd in his voice that made me glance up from the job at hand. He caught the glance and looked away, flushing.

â€œIâ€”did not approve of reading novels. Then.â€

He was quiet for a moment, holding his hand steady. Then he blurted, â€œI burnt her books.â€

That sounded rather more like the response I would have expected of him.

â€œShe couldnâ€™t have been pleased about that,â€ I said mildly, and he shot me a startled glance, as though the question of his wifeâ€™s reaction was so irrelevant as to be unworthy of remark.

â€œAh . . . what caused you to alter your opinion?â€ I asked, concentrating on the bits of debris I was picking out of the wound with my forceps. Splinters and shreds of bark. What had he been doing? Wielding a club of some kind, I thoughtâ€”a tree branch? I breathed deeply, concentrating on the job to avoid thinking of the bodies in the clearing.

He moved his legs restively; I was hurting him a bit now.

â€œIâ€”itâ€”in Ardsmuir.â€

â€œWhat? You read it in prison?â€

â€œNo. We had no books there.â€ He took a long breath, glanced at me, then away, and fixed his eyes on the corner of the room, where an enterprising spider had taken advantage of Mrs. Bugâ€™s temporary absence to set up web-keeping.

â€œIn fact, I have never actually read it. Mr. Fraser, though, was accustomed to recount the story to the other prisoners. He has a fine memory,â€ he added, rather grudgingly.

â€œYes, he does,â€ I murmured. â€œIâ€™m not going to stitch it; it will be better if the woundâ€™s left to heal by itself. Iâ€™m afraid the scar wonâ€™t be as neat,â€ I added regretfully, â€œbut I think it will heal up all right.â€

I spread salve thickly over the injury, and pulled the edges of the wound together as tightly as I could, without cutting off the circulation. Bree had been experimenting with adhesive bandages, and had produced something quite useful in the way of small butterfly shapes, made of starched linen and pine tar.

â€œSo you liked Tom Jones, did you?â€ I said, returning to the subject. â€œI shouldnâ€™t have thought youâ€™d find him an admirable character. Not much of a moral example, I mean.â€

â€œI donâ€™t,â€ he said bluntly. â€œBut I saw that fictionâ€â€”he pronounced the word gingerly, as though it were something dangerousâ€”â€œis perhaps not, as I had thought, merely an inducement to idleness and wicked fancy.â€

â€œOh, isnâ€™t it?â€ I said, amused, but trying not to smile because of my lip. â€œWhat are its redeeming characteristics, do you think?â€

â€œAye, well.â€ His brows drew together in thought â€œI found it most remarkable. That what is essentially nothing save a confection of lies should somewise still contrive to exert a beneficial effect. For it did,â€ he concluded, sounding still rather surprised.

â€œReally? How was that?â€

He tilted his head, considering.

â€œIt was distraction, to be sure. In such conditions, distraction is not evil,â€ he assured me. â€œWhile it is of course more desirable to escape into prayer . . .â€

â€œOh, of course,â€ I murmured.

â€œBut beyond that consideration . . . it drew the men together. You would not think that such menâ€”Highlanders, croftersâ€”that they would find themselves in particular sympathy with . . . such situations, such persons.â€ He waved his free hand at the book, indicating such persons as Squire Allworthy and Lady Bellaston, I supposed.

â€œBut they would talk it over for hoursâ€”whilst we labored the next day, they would wonder why Ensign Northerton had done as he had with regard to Miss Western, and argue whether they themselves would or would not have behaved so.â€ His face lightened a little, recalling something. â€œAnd invariably, a man would shake his head and say, â€˜At least Iâ€™ve never been treated in that manner!â€™ He might be starved, cold, covered in sores, permanently separated from his family and customary circumstancesâ€”and yet he could take comfort in never having suffered such vicissitudes as had befallen these imaginary beings!â€

He actually smiled, shaking his head at the thought, and I thought the smile much improved him.

Iâ€™d finished the job, and laid his hand on the table.

â€œThank you,â€ I said quietly.

He looked startled.

â€œWhat? Why?â€

â€œIâ€™m assuming that that injury was perhaps the result of b-battle done on my behalf,â€ I said. I touched his hand lightly. â€œI, er . . . well.â€ I took a deep breath. â€œThank you.â€

â€œOh.â€ He looked thoroughly taken aback at this, and quite embarrassed.

â€œI . . . erm . . . hmm!â€ He pushed back the stool and rose, looking flustered.

I rose, as well.

â€œYouâ€™ll need to have fresh salve put on every day,â€ I said, resuming a businesslike tone. â€œIâ€™ll make up some more; you can come, or send Malva to fetch it.â€

He nodded, but said nothing, having evidently exhausted his supply of sociability for the day. I saw his eye linger on the cover of the book, though, and on impulse offered it to him.

â€œWould you like to borrow it? You should really read it for yourself; Iâ€™m sure Jamie canâ€™t have recalled all the details.â€

â€œOh!â€ He looked startled, and pursed his lips, frowning, as though suspecting it was a trap of some sort. When I insisted, though, he took the book, picking it up with an expression of guarded avidity that made me wonder how long it had been since he had had any book other than the Bible to read.

He nodded thanks to me, and donned his hat, turning to go. Upon a momentâ€™s impulse, I asked, â€œDid you ever have the chance to apologize to your wife?â€

That was a mistake. His face tightened into coldness and his eyes went flat as a snakeâ€™s.

â€œNo,â€ he said shortly. I thought for a moment that he would put the book down and refuse to take it. But instead, he tightened his lips, tucked the volume more securely under his arm, and left, without further farewell.

AND SO TO BED




NO ONE ELSE CAME. By the time night fell, I was beginning to feel rather edgy, starting at noises, searching the deepening shadows under the chestnut trees for lurking menâ€”or worse. I thought I should cook something; surely Jamie and Ian intended coming home for supper? Or perhaps I should go down to the cabin, join Roger and Bree.

But I flinched from the notion of being exposed to any kind of solicitude, no matter how well meant, and while I hadnâ€™t yet got up the nerve to look in a mirror, was reasonably sure that the sight of me would frighten Jemmyâ€”or at least lead to a lot of questions. I didnâ€™t want to have to try to explain to him what had happened to me. I was fairly sure that Jamie had told Brianna to stay away for a bit, and that was good. I really was in no shape to pretend to be all right. Not quite yet.

Dithering round the kitchen, I picked things up and put them down pointlessly. I opened the drawers of the sideboard and closed themâ€”then opened the second one again, the one where Jamie kept his pistols.

Most of the pistols were gone. Only the gilt-trimmed one that didnâ€™t shoot straight was left, with a few loads and a tiny powder horn, the sort made for fancy dueling pistols.

Hands shaking only a little, I loaded it, and poured a bit of powder into the firing pan.

When the back door opened, quite some time later, I was sitting at the table, a copy of Don Quixote lying in front of me, pointing the pistol with both hands at the door.

Ian froze momentarily.

â€œYeâ€™d never hit anyone wiâ€™ that gun at this distance, Auntie,â€ he said mildly, coming in.

â€œThey wouldnâ€™t know that, would they?â€ I set the pistol down, gingerly. My palms were damp, and my fingers ached.

He nodded, taking the point, and sat down.

â€œWhereâ€™s Jamie?â€ I asked.

â€œWashing. Are ye well, Auntie?â€ His soft hazel eyes took a casual but careful estimation of my state.

â€œNo, but Iâ€™ll do.â€ I hesitated. â€œAnd . . . Mr. Brown? Did heâ€”tell you anything?â€

Ian made a derogatory noise.

â€œPissed himself when Uncle Jamie took the dirk from his belt to clean his fingernails. We didna touch him, Auntie, dinna fash yourself.â€

Jamie came in then, clean-shaven, his skin cold and fresh from the well water, hair damp at his temples. Despite that, he looked tired to death, the lines of his face cut deep and his eyes shadowed. The shadows lifted a bit, though, when he saw me and the pistol.

â€œItâ€™s all right, a nighean,â€ he said softly, touching my shoulder as he sat down beside me. â€œIâ€™ve men set to watch the houseâ€”just in case. Though I dinna expect any trouble for some days yet.â€

My breath went out in a long sigh.

â€œYou could have told me that.â€

He glanced at me, surprised.

â€œI thought yeâ€™d know. Surely ye wouldna think Iâ€™d leave ye unprotected, Sassenach?â€

I shook my head, momentarily unable to speak. Had I been in any condition to think logically, of course I wouldnâ€™t. As it was, I had spent most of the afternoon in a state of quietâ€”and unnecessaryâ€”terror, imagining, remembering. . . .

â€œIâ€™m sorry, lass,â€ he said softly, and put a large, cold hand on mine. â€œI shouldna have left ye alone. I thoughtâ€”â€

I shook my head, but put my other hand over his, pressing tight.

â€œNo, you were right. I couldnâ€™t have borne any company, beyond Sancho Panza.â€

He glanced at Don Quixote, then at me, brows raised. The book was in Spanish, which I didnâ€™t happen to speak.

â€œWell, some of it was close to French, and I did know the story,â€ I said. I took a deep breath, taking what comfort I could in the warmth of the fire, the flicker of the candle, and the proximity of the two of them, large, solid, pragmatic, andâ€”outwardly, at leastâ€”imperturbable.

â€œIs there any food, Auntie?â€ Ian inquired, getting up to look. Lacking any appetite myself, and too jittery to focus on anything, I hadnâ€™t eaten dinner nor made anything for supperâ€”but there was always food in that house, and without any particular fuss, Jamie and Ian had equipped themselves in short order with the remains of a cold partridge pie, several hard-cooked eggs, a dish of piccalilli, and half a loaf of bread, which they sliced up and toasted over the fire on a fork, buttering the slices and cramming them into me in a manner brooking no argument.

Hot, buttered toast is immensely comforting, even nibbled tentatively with a sore jaw. With food in my stomach, I began to feel much calmer, and capable of inquiring what they had learned from Lionel Brown.

â€œHe put it all on Hodgepile,â€ Jamie told me, loading piccalilli onto a slice of pie. â€œHe would, of course.â€

â€œYou didnâ€™t meet Arvin Hodgepile,â€ I said, with a small shiver. â€œEr . . . to talk to, I mean.â€

He shot me a sharp look, but didnâ€™t address that matter any further, instead leaving it to Ian to explain Lionel Brownâ€™s version of events.

It had started with him and his brother, Richard, establishing their Committee of Safety. This, he had insisted, was intended as public service, pure and simple. Jamie snorted at that, but didnâ€™t interrupt.

Most of the male inhabitants of Brownsville had joined the committeeâ€”most of the homesteaders and small farmers nearby had not. Still, so far, so good. The committee had dealt with a number of small matters, meting out justice in cases of assault, theft, and the like, and if they had appropriated the odd hog or deer carcass by way of payment for their trouble, there hadnâ€™t been too much complaint.

â€œThereâ€™s a great deal of feeling still, about the Regulation,â€ Ian explained, frowning as he sliced another piece of bread. â€œThe Browns didna join the Regulation; theyâ€™d no need to, as their cousin was sheriff, and half the courthouse ring are Browns, or marrit to Browns.â€ Corruption, in other words, had been on their side.

Regulator sentiment still ran high in the backcountry, even though the main leaders of the movement, such as Hermon Husband and James Hunter, had left the colony. In the aftermath of Alamance, most Regulators had grown more cautious of expressing themselvesâ€”but several Regulator families who lived near Brownsville had become vocal in their criticism of the Brownsâ€™ influence on local politics and business.

â€œTige Oâ€™Brian was one of those?â€ I asked, feeling the buttered toast coalesce into a small, hard lump in my stomach. Jamie had told me what had happened to the Oâ€™Briansâ€”and Iâ€™d seen Rogerâ€™s face when heâ€™d come back.

Jamie nodded, not looking up from his pie.

â€œEnter Arvin Hodgepile,â€ he said, and took a ferocious bite. Hodgepile, having neatly escaped the constraints of the British army by pretending to die in the warehouse fire at Cross Creek, had set about making a living in various unsavory ways. And, water having a strong tendency to seek its own level, had ended up with a small gang of like-minded thugs.

This gang had begun simply enough, by robbing anyone they came across, holding up taverns, and the like. This sort of behavior tends to attract attention, though, and with various constables, sheriffs, Committees of Safety, and the like on their trail, the gang had retired from the piedmont where they began, and moved up into the mountains, where they could find isolated settlements and homesteads. They had also begun killing their victims, to avoid the nuisance of identification and pursuit.

â€œOr most of them,â€ Ian murmured. He regarded the half-eaten egg in his hand for a moment, then put it down.

In his career with the army in Cross Creek, Hodgepile had made various contacts with a number of river traders and coastal smugglers. Some dealt in furs, others in anything that would bring a profit.

â€œAnd it occurred to them,â€ Jamie said, drawing a deep breath, â€œthat girls and women and young boys are more profitable than almost anythingâ€”save whisky, maybe.â€ The corner of his mouth twitched, but it wasnâ€™t a smile.

â€œOur Mr. Brown insists heâ€™d nothing to do wiâ€™ this,â€ Ian added, a cynical note in his voice. â€œNor had his brother or their committee.â€

â€œBut how did the Browns get involved with Hodgepileâ€™s gang?â€ I asked. â€œAnd what did they do with the people they kidnapped?â€

The answer to the first question was that it had been the happy outcome of a botched robbery.

â€œYe recall Aaron Beardsleyâ€™s auld place, aye?â€

â€œI do,â€ I said, wrinkling my nose in reflex at the memory of that wretched sty, then emitting a small cry and clapping both hands over my abused appendage.

Jamie glanced at me, and put another bit of bread on his toasting fork.

â€œWell, so,â€ he went on, ignoring my protest that I was full, â€œthe Browns took it over, of course, when they adopted the wee lass. They cleaned it out, stocked it fresh, and went on using it as a trading post.â€

The Cherokee and Catawba had been accustomed to come to the placeâ€”horrid as it wasâ€”when Aaron Beardsley had operated as an Indian trader, and had continued to do business with the new managementâ€”a very beneficial and profitable arrangement all round.

â€œWhich is what Hodgepile saw,â€ Ian put in. The Hodgepile gang, with their usual straightforward methods of doing business, had walked in, shot the couple in charge, and begun systematically looting the place. The coupleâ€™s eleven-year-old daughter, who had fortunately been in the barn when the gang arrived, had slipped out, mounted a mule, and ridden hell-for-leather for Brownsville and help. By good fortune, she had encountered the Committee of Safety, returning from some errand, and brought them back in time to confront the robbers.

There then ensued what in later years would be called a Mexican standoff. The Browns had the house surrounded. Hodgepile, however, had Alicia Beardsley Brownâ€”the two-year-old girl who legally owned the trading post, and who had been adopted by the Browns upon the death of her putative father.

Hodgepile had enough food and ammunition inside the trading post to withstand a siege of weeks; the Browns were disinclined to set fire to their valuable property in order to drive him out, or to risk the girlâ€™s life by storming the place. After a day or two during which desultory shots were exchanged, and the members of the committee became increasingly edgy at having to camp in the woods surrounding the trading post, a flag of truce had been waved from the upper window, and Richard Brown had gone inside to parley with Hodgepile.

The result being a wary sort of merger. Hodgepileâ€™s gang would continue their operations, steering clear of any settlement under the Brownsâ€™ protection, but would bring the proceeds of their robberies to the trading post, where they could be disposed of inconspicuously at a good profit, with Hodgepileâ€™s gang taking a generous cut.

â€œThe proceeds,â€ I said, accepting a fresh slice of buttered toast from Jamie. â€œThatâ€”you do mean captives?â€

â€œSometimes.â€ His lips pressed tight as he poured a mug of cider and handed it to me. â€œAnd depending upon where they were. When they took captives in the mountains, some of them were sold to the Indians, through the trading post. Those they took from the piedmont, they sold to river pirates, or took to the coast to sell on to the Indiesâ€”that would be the best price, aye? A fourteen-year-old lad would bring a hundred pound, at least.â€

My lips felt numb, and not only from the cider.

â€œHow long?â€ I said, appalled. â€œHow many?â€ Children, young men, young women, wrenched from their homes and sold cold-bloodedly into slavery. No one to follow. Even if they were somehow to escape eventually, there would be no placeâ€”no oneâ€”to return to.

Jamie sighed. He looked unutterably tired.

â€œBrown doesna ken,â€ Ian said quietly. â€œHe says . . . He says heâ€™d nothing to do with it.â€

â€œLike bloody hell he hadnâ€™t,â€ I said, a flash of fury momentarily eclipsing horror. â€œHe was with Hodgepile when they came here. He knew they meant to take the whisky. And he must have been with them before, when theyâ€”did other things.â€

Jamie nodded.

â€œHe claims he tried to stop them from taking you.â€

â€œHe did,â€ I said shortly. â€œAnd then he tried to make them kill me, to stop me telling you heâ€™d been there. And then he bloody meant to drown me himself! I donâ€™t suppose he told you that.â€

â€œNo, he didnâ€™t.â€ Ian exchanged a brief look with Jamie, and I saw some unspoken agreement pass between them. It occurred to me that I might possibly just have sealed Lionel Brownâ€™s fate. If so, I was not sure I felt guilty about it.

â€œWhatâ€”what do you mean to do with him?â€ I asked.

â€œI think perhaps I will hang him,â€ Jamie replied, after a momentâ€™s pause. â€œBut Iâ€™ve more questions I want answered. And I must think about how best to manage the matter. Dinna bother about it, Sassenach; yeâ€™ll not see him again.â€

With that, he stood and stretched, muscles cracking, then shifted his shoulders, settling himself with a sigh. He gave me a hand and helped me to my feet.

â€œGo up to bed, Sassenach, and Iâ€™ll be up directly. I must just have a wee word with Ian first.â€



HOT BUTTERED TOAST, cider, and conversation had made me feel momentarily better. I found myself so tired, though, that I could barely drag myself up the stairs, and was obliged to sit on the bed, swaying blearily, in hopes of getting up the strength to take off my clothes. It was a few moments before I noticed that Jamie was hovering in the doorway.

â€œErm . . . ?â€ I said vaguely.

â€œI didna ken, did ye want me to stay with ye tonight?â€ he asked diffidently. â€œIf yeâ€™d rest better alone, I could take Josephâ€™s bed. Or if yeâ€™d like, I could sleep beside ye, on the floor.â€

â€œOh,â€ I said blankly, trying to weigh these alternatives. â€œNo. Stay. Sleep with me, I mean.â€ From the bottom of a well of fatigue, I summoned something like a smile. â€œYou can warm the bed, at least.â€

A most peculiar expression flitted across his face at that, and I blinked, not sure Iâ€™d seen it. I had, though; his face was caught between embarrassment and dismayed amusementâ€”with somewhere behind all that the sort of look he might have worn if going to the stake: heroically resigned.

â€œWhat on earth have you been doing?â€ I asked, sufficiently surprised as to be shaken out of my torpor.

Embarrassment was getting the upper hand; the tips of his ears were going red, and a flush was visible in his cheeks, even by the dim light of the taper Iâ€™d set on the table.

â€œI wasna going to tell ye,â€ he muttered, avoiding my gaze. â€œI swore wee Ian and Roger Mac to silence.â€

â€œOh, theyâ€™ve been silent as the grave,â€ I assured him. Though this statement did perhaps explain the occasional odd look on Rogerâ€™s face, of late. â€œWhatâ€™s been going on?â€

He sighed, scraping the edge of his boot across the floor.

â€œAye, well. Itâ€™s Tsisqua, dâ€™ye see? He meant it as hospitality, the first time, but then when Ian told him . . . well, it wasna the best thing to have said, under the circumstances, only . . . And then the next time we came, and there they were again, only a different pair, and when I tried to make them leave, they said Bird said to say that it was honor to my vow, for what good was a vow that cost nothing to keep? And I will be damned if I ken does he mean that, or is he only thinking that either Iâ€™ll crack and heâ€™ll have the upper hand of me for good, or that Iâ€™ll get him the guns he wants to put an end to it one way or the otherâ€”or is he only having a joke at my expense? Even Ian says he canna tell which it is, and if heâ€”â€

â€œJamie,â€ I said. â€œWhat are you talking about?â€

He stole a quick glance at me, then looked away again.

â€œAh . . . naked women,â€ he blurted, and went red as a piece of new flannel.

I stared at him for a moment. My ears still buzzed slightly, but there wasnâ€™t anything wrong with my hearing. I pointed a finger at himâ€”carefully, because all my fingers were swollen and bruised.

â€œYou,â€ I said, in measured tones, â€œcome here right now. Sit down right thereâ€â€”I pointed at the bed beside meâ€”â€œand tell me in words of one syllable exactly what youâ€™ve been doing.â€

He did, with the result that five minutes later I was lying flat on the bed, wheezing with laughter, moaning with the pain to my cracked ribs, and with helpless tears running down my temples and into my ears.

â€œOh, God, oh, God, oh, God,â€ I gasped. â€œI canâ€™t stand it, I really canâ€™t. Help me sit up.â€ I extended a hand, yelped with pain as his fingers closed on my lacerated wrist, but got upright at last, bent over with a pillow clutched to my middle, and clutched it tighter each time a gust of recurrent laughter struck me.

â€œIâ€™m glad ye think itâ€™s sae funny, Sassenach,â€ Jamie said very dryly. Heâ€™d recovered himself to some extent, though his face was still flushed. â€œYeâ€™re sure yeâ€™re no hysterical?â€

â€œNo, not at all.â€ I sniffed, dabbing at my eyes with a damp linen hankie, then snorted with uncontainable mirth. â€œOh! Ow, God, that hurts.â€

Sighing, he poured a cup of water from the flask on the bedside table, and held it for me to drink. It was cool, but flat and rather stale; I thought perhaps it had been standing since before . . .

â€œAll right,â€ I said, waving the cup away and dabbing moisture very carefully from my lips. â€œIâ€™m fine.â€ I breathed shallowly, feeling my heart begin to slow down. â€œWell. So. At least now I know why youâ€™ve been coming back from the Cherokee villages in such a state ofâ€”ofâ€”â€ I felt an unhinged giggle rising, and bent over, moaning as I stifled it. â€œOh, Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ. And here I thought it was thoughts of me, driving you mad with lust.â€

He snorted then himself, though mildly. He put down the cup, rose, and turned back the coverlet. Then he looked at me, and his eyes were clear, unguarded.

â€œClaire,â€ he said, quite gently, â€œit was you. Itâ€™s always been you, and it always will be. Get into bed, and put the candle out. As soon as Iâ€™ve fastened the shutters, smoored the hearth, and barred the door, Iâ€™ll come and keep ye warm.â€



â€œKILL ME.â€ Randallâ€™s eyes were fever-bright. â€œKill me,â€ he said. â€œMy heartâ€™s desire.â€

He jerked awake, hearing the words echo in his head, seeing the eyes, seeing the rain-matted hair, Randallâ€™s face, wet as that of a drowned man.

He rubbed a hand hard over his own face, surprised to feel his skin dry, his beard no more than a shadow. The sense of wet, the itching scurf of a monthâ€™s whiskers, was still so strong that he got up, moving quietly by instinct, and went to the window, where moonlight shone through the cracks in the shutter. He poured a little water into the basin, moved the bowl into a shaft of light, and looked in, to rid himself of that lingering sense of being someone else, somewhere else.

The face in the water was no more than a featureless oval, but smooth-shaven, and the hair lay loose on his shoulders, not bound up for battle. And yet it seemed the face of a stranger.

Unsettled, he left the water in the bowl, and after a moment, padded softly back to the bed.

She was asleep. He had not even thought of her when he woke, but now the sight of her steadied him. That face he knew, even battered and swollen as it was.

He set his hand on the bedstead, comforted by the solid wood. Sometimes when he woke, the dream stayed with him, and he felt the real world ghostly, faint around him. Sometimes he feared he was a ghost.

But the sheets were cool on his skin, and Claireâ€™s warmth a reassurance. He reached for her, and she rolled over, curled herself backward into his arms with a small moan of content, her bum roundly solid against him.

She fell asleep again at once; she hadnâ€™t really waked. He had an urge to rouse her, make her talk to himâ€”only to be quite sure she could see him, hear him. He only held her tight, though, and over her curly head he watched the door, as though it might open and Jack Randall stand there, soaked and streaming.

Kill me, heâ€™d said. My heartâ€™s desire.

His heart beat slow, echoing in the ear he pressed against the pillow. Some nights, he would fall asleep listening to it, comforted by the fleshy, monotonous thump. Other times, like now, he would hear instead the mortal silence in between the beatsâ€”that silence that patiently awaits all men.

He had drawn the quilts up, but now put them back, so that Claire was covered but his own back lay bare, open to the chill of the room, that he might not slip warmly into sleep and risk returning to the dream. Let sleep struggle for him in the cold, and at last pull him off the precipice of consciousness, down to the deeps of black oblivion.

For he did not wish to know what Randall had meant by what he said.

HANGINGâ€™S TOO GOOD




IN THE MORNING, Mrs. Bug was back in the kitchen, and the air was warm and fragrant with the smells of cooking. She seemed quite as usual, and beyond a brief glance at my face and a â€œtsk!â€, not inclined to fuss. Either she had more sensitivity than Iâ€™d thought, or Jamie had had a word.

â€œHere, a muirninn, have it while itâ€™s hot.â€ Mrs. Bug slid a heap of turkey hash from the platter onto my plate, and deftly topped it with a fried egg.

I nodded thanks and picked up my fork, with a certain lack of enthusiasm. My jaw was still so sore that eating was a slow and painful business.

The egg went down all right, but the smell of burned onion seemed very strong, oily in my nostrils. I separated a small bite of potato and mashed it against the roof of my mouth, squashing it with my tongue in lieu of chewing it, then washing it down with a sip of coffee.

More in hopes of distracting myself than because I truly wanted to know, I asked, â€œAnd how is Mr. Brown this morning?â€

Her lips tightened, and she smacked down a spatula of fried potatoes as though they were Brownâ€™s brains.

â€œNowhere near sae badly off as he ought to be,â€ she said. â€œHangingâ€™s too good for him, and him nay more than a wretched dungheap, crawling wiâ€™ maggots.â€

I spit out the bit of potato Iâ€™d been mangling, and took another hasty gulp of coffee. It hit bottom and started back up. I pushed back the bench and ran for the door, reaching it just in time to throw up into the blackberry bush, retching coffee, bile, and fried egg.

I was dimly aware of Mrs. Bug, hovering anxiously in the doorway, and waved her away with one hand. She hesitated for a moment, but then went in again, as I stood up and started toward the well.

The entire inside of my head tasted of coffee and bile, and the back of my nose stung terribly. I felt as though my nose were bleeding again, but when I touched it gingerly, discovered that it wasnâ€™t. Careful swilling with water cleansed my mouth, and did a bit to remedy the nasty tasteâ€”but nothing to drown the panic that had come in the wake of the nausea.

I had the sudden, distinct, and thoroughly bizarre impression that my skin was missing. My legs felt shaky, and I sat down on the stump where we split kindling, heedless of splinters.

I canâ€™t, I thought. I simply canâ€™t.

I sat on the chopping block, lacking the will to rise. I could feel my womb, very distinctly. A small, round weight at the base of my abdomen, feeling slightly swollen, very tender.

Nothing, I thought, with what determination I could muster. Entirely normal. It always feels that way, at a particular point of my cycle. And after what we had done, Jamie and I . . . well, no bloody wonder if I were still conscious of my interior workings. Granted, we hadnâ€™t, the night before; Iâ€™d wanted nothing but to be held. On the other hand, Iâ€™d nearly ruptured myself, laughing. A small laugh escaped me now, remembering Jamieâ€™s confession. It hurt, and I clutched my ribs, but felt a little better.

â€œWell, bloody hell anyway,â€ I said aloud, and got up. â€œIâ€™ve things to do.â€

Propelled by this bold statement, I fetched my basket and foraging knife, told Mrs. Bug I was off, and set out toward the Christiesâ€™.

Iâ€™d check Tomâ€™s hand, then invite Malva to come out with me in search of ginseng root, and any other useful things we might come across. She was an apt pupil, observant and quick, with a good memory for plants. And Iâ€™d meant to teach her how to prepare penicillin colonies. Picking through a collection of damp, moldy garbage would be soothing. I ignored a slight tendency of my gorge to rise at the thought, and lifted my battered face to the morning sun.

And I wasnâ€™t going to worry about what Jamie meant to do with Lionel Brown, either.

IN WHICH MRS. BUG

TAKES A HAND




BY THE NEXT MORNING, I had recovered quite a bit. My stomach had settled, and I felt much more resilient, emotionally; a good thing, as whatever warnings Jamie had given Mrs. Bug about fussing over me had plainly worn off.

Everything hurt less, and my hands had nearly returned to normal, but I was still desperately tired, and it was in fact rather comforting to put my feet up on the settle and be brought cups of coffeeâ€”the tea was running very low, and no chance of more likely for several yearsâ€”and dishes of rice pudding with raisins in.

â€œAnd yeâ€™re quite sure as your face will go back to lookinâ€™ like a face, are ye?â€ Mrs. Bug handed me a fresh muffin, dripping with butter and honey, and peered dubiously at me, lips pursed.

I was tempted to ask her what the thing on the front of my head looked like now, but was fairly sure I didnâ€™t want to hear the answer. Instead, I contented myself with a brief â€œYesâ€ and a request for more coffee.

â€œI kent a wumman up in Kirkcaldy once, as was kicked in the face by a cow,â€ she said, still eyeing me critically as she dished up the coffee. â€œLost her front teeth, puir creature, and ever after, her nose pointed off to the side, like that.â€ She pushed her own small round nose sharply to the side with an index finger in illustration, simultaneously tucking her upper lip under the lower one to simulate toothlessness.

I touched the bridge of my own nose carefully, but it was reassuringly straight, if still puffy.

â€œAnd then there was WIlliam McCrea of Balgownie, him who fought at Sheriffsmuir with my Arch. Got in the way of an English pike, and cleaved off half his jaw, and the best part of his nose! Arch said ye could see straight into his gullet and his brain-box bothâ€”but he lived. On parritch, mostly,â€ she added. â€œAnd whisky.â€

â€œWhat a very good idea,â€ I said, putting down the nibbled muffin. â€œI believe Iâ€™ll go and get some.â€

Carrying my cup, I escaped as quickly as I could down the hall to my surgery, followed by shouted reminiscences of Dominic Mulroney, an Irishman whoâ€™d walked face-first into a church door in Edinburgh and him sober as a sheep at the time. . . .

I shut the door of the surgery behind me, opened the window, and tossed the remains of the coffee out, then took down the bottle from the shelf and filled my cup to the brim.

I had intended to ask Mrs. Bug about Lionel Brownâ€™s state of health, but . . . perhaps that could wait. I found that my hands were trembling again, and had to press them flat on the table for a moment to steady them before I could pick up the cup.

I took a deep breath, and a swallow of whisky. Another. Yes, that was better.

Small waves of pointless panic tended still to seize me unawares. I hadnâ€™t had one this morning, and had rather hoped theyâ€™d gone away. Not quite yet, apparently.

I sipped whisky, dabbed cold sweat from my temples, and looked round for something useful to do. Malva and I had started some fresh penicillin the day before, and had made up fresh tinctures of boneset and troutlilly, and some fresh gentian salve, as well. I ended up thumbing slowly through my big black casebook, sipping whisky and dwelling on pages recounting various horrible complications of childbirth.

I realized what I was doing, but didnâ€™t seem able to stop doing it. I was not pregnant. I was sure of it. And yet my womb felt tender, inflamed, and my whole being disturbed.

Oh, there was a jolly one; one of Daniel Rawlingsâ€™s entries, describing a slave woman of middle age, suffering from a recto-vaginal fistula that caused her to leak a constant small stream of fecal matter through the vagina.

Such fistulas were caused by battering during childbirth, and were more common in very young girls, where the strain of prolonged labor often caused such tearsâ€”or in older women, where the tissues had grown less elastic. Of course, in older women, the damage was quite likely to be accompanied by complete perineal collapse, allowing uterus, urethraâ€”and possibly the anus for good measureâ€”to sag through the pelvic floor.

â€œHow extremely fortunate that I am not pregnant,â€ I said aloud, closing the book firmly. Perhaps Iâ€™d have another go at Don Quixote.

On the whole, it was a considerable relief when Malva Christie came and tapped on the door, just before noon.

She gave my face a quick glance, but as she had the day before, merely accepted my appearance without comment.

â€œHowâ€™s your fatherâ€™s hand?â€ I asked.

â€œOh, itâ€™s fine, maâ€™am,â€ she replied quickly. â€œI looked just as ye said, but no red streaks, no pus, and just that tiny bit of redness near where the skin is cut. I made him wiggle his fingers like ye said,â€ she added, a dimple showing briefly in her cheek. â€œHe didna want to, and carried on like I was poking thorns into himâ€”but he did it.â€

â€œOh, well done!â€ I said, and patted her on the shoulder, which made her pinken with pleasure.

â€œI think that deserves a biscuit with honey,â€ I added, having noted the delectable aroma of baking that had been wafting down the hall from the kitchen for the last hour. â€œCome along.â€

As we entered the hallway and turned toward the kitchen, though, I heard an odd sort of noise from behind us. A peculiar kind of thumping or dragging outside, as though some large animal was lumbering across the hollow boards of the front stoop.

â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ Malva said, looking over her shoulder in alarm.

A loud groan answered her, and a thud! that shook the front door as something fell against it.

â€œMary, Joseph, and Bride!â€ Mrs. Bug had popped out of the kitchen, crossing herself. â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€

My heart had begun to race at the noises, and my mouth went dry. Something large and dark blocked the line of light beneath the door, and stertorous breathing was clearly audible, interspersed with groans.

â€œWell, whatever it is, itâ€™s sick or injured,â€ I said. â€œStand back.â€ I wiped my hands on my apron, swallowed, walked forward, and pulled open the door.

For a moment, I didnâ€™t recognize him; he was no more than a heap of flesh, wild hair, and disheveled garments smeared with dirt. But then he struggled up onto one knee and raised his head, panting, showing me a dead-white face, marked with bruises and glossy with sweat.

â€œMr. Brown?â€ I said, incredulous.

His eyes were glazed; I wasnâ€™t sure that he saw me at all, but clearly he recognized my voice, for he lunged forward, nearly knocking me over. I stepped smartly back, but he caught me by the foot and held on, crying, â€œMercy! Mistress, have mercy on me, I pray you!â€

â€œWhat in the name ofâ€”let go. Let go, I say!â€ I shook my foot, trying to dislodge him, but he clung like a limpet, and went on shouting, â€œMercy!â€ in a sort of hoarse, desperate chant.

â€œOh, shut your noise, man,â€ Mrs. Bug said crossly. Recovered from the shock of his entrance, she appeared not at all discomposed by his appearance, though substantially annoyed by it.

Lionel Brown did not shut up, but went on imploring me for mercy, despite my attempts to placate him. These were interrupted by Mrs. Bug leaning past me, a large meat-mallet in her hand, and dotting Mr. Brown smartly on the head with it. His eyes rolled back in his head and he dropped on his face without another word.

â€œIâ€™m that sorry, Mrs. Fraser,â€ Mrs. Bug said, apologetic. â€œI canna think how he got out, let alone came all this way!â€

I didnâ€™t know how heâ€™d got out, either, but it was quite clear how heâ€™d comeâ€”heâ€™d crawled, dragging his broken leg. His hands and legs were scratched and bloody, his breeches in tatters, and the whole of him covered with smears of mud, stuck full of grass and leaves.

I leaned down and plucked an elm leaf from his hair, trying to think what on earth to do with him. The obvious, I supposed.

â€œHelp me get him into the surgery,â€ I said, sighing as I bent to get him under the arms.

â€œYe canna be doing that, Mrs. Fraser!â€ Mrs. Bug was scandalized. â€œHimself was verra fierce about it; ye mustna be troubled by this scoundrel, he said, nor even catch sight of the man!â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s a bit late not to catch sight of him,â€ I said, tugging at the inert body. â€œWe canâ€™t just let him lie on the porch, can we? Help me!â€

Mrs. Bug appeared to see no good reason why Mr. Brown ought not to continue lying on the porch, but when Malvaâ€”who had been pressed flat against the wall, wide-eyed, during the uproarâ€”came to help, Mrs. Bug gave in with a sigh, laying down her weapon and lending a hand.

He had recovered consciousness by the time we got him man-handled onto the surgery table, and was moaning, â€œDonâ€™t let him kill me . . . please donâ€™t let him kill me!â€

â€œWould you be quiet?â€ I said, thoroughly irritated. â€œLet me look at your leg.â€

No one had improved on my original rough splinting job, and his journey from the Bugsâ€™ cabin hadnâ€™t done it any good; blood was seeping through the bandages. I was frankly amazed that he had made it, considering his other injuries. His flesh was clammy and his breath shallow, but he wasnâ€™t badly fevered.

â€œWill you bring me some hot water, please, Mrs. Bug?â€ I asked, gingerly prodding the fractured limb. â€œAnd perhaps a little whisky? Heâ€™ll need something for shock.â€

â€œI will not,â€ Mrs. Bug said, giving the patient a look of intense dislike. â€œWe should just be saving Mr. Fraser the trouble of dealing wiâ€™ the gobshite, if he hasna got the courtesy to die by himself.â€ She was still holding her mallet, and raised it in a threatening manner, causing Mr. Brown to cower and cry out, as the movement hurt his broken wrist.

â€œIâ€™ll fetch the water,â€ Malva said, and disappeared.

Ignoring my attempts to deal with his injuries, Mr. Brown seized my wrist with his one good hand, his grip surprisingly strong.

â€œDonâ€™t let him kill me,â€ he said hoarsely, fixing me with bloodshot eyes. â€œPlease, I beg you!â€

I hesitated. I hadnâ€™t exactly forgotten Mr. Brownâ€™s existence, but I had more or less suppressed the knowledge of it over the last day or so. I had been only too glad not to think of him.

He saw my hesitation, and licked his lips, trying again.

â€œSave me, Mrs. Fraserâ€”I implore you! You are the only one he will listen to!â€

With some difficulty, I detached his hand from my wrist.

â€œWhy, exactly, do you think anyone wants to kill you?â€ I asked carefully.

Brown didnâ€™t laugh, but his mouth twisted bitterly at that.

â€œHe says that he will. I donâ€™t doubt him.â€ He seemed a little calmer now, and took a deep, shuddering breath. â€œPlease, Mrs. Fraser,â€ he said more softly. â€œI beg youâ€”save me.â€

I glanced up at Mrs. Bug, and read the truth in her folded arms and tight lips. She knew.

At this point, Malva hurried in, a beaker of hot water in one hand, the whisky jug in the other.

â€œWhat shall I do?â€ she asked breathlessly.

â€œEr . . . in the cupboard,â€ I said, trying to focus my mind. â€œDo you know what comfrey looks likeâ€”boneset?â€ I had hold of Brownâ€™s wrist, automatically checking his pulse. It was galloping.

â€œAye, maâ€™am. Shall I put some to steep, then?â€ She had set down the jug and beaker and was already hunting through the cupboard.

I met Brownâ€™s eyes, trying for dispassion.

â€œYou would have killed me, if you could,â€ I said very quietly. My own pulse was going nearly as fast as his.

â€œNo,â€ he said, but his eyes slid away from mine. Only a fraction, but away. â€œNo, I never would!â€

â€œYou told H-Hodgepile to kill me.â€ My voice shook on the name and a flush of anger burgeoned suddenly inside me. â€œYou know you did!â€

His left wrist was likely broken, and no one had set it; the flesh was puffy, dark with bruising. Even so, he pressed his free hand over mine, urgent with the need to convince me. The smell of him was rank, hot, and feral, likeâ€”

I ripped my hand free, revulsion crawling over my skin like a swarm of centipedes. I rubbed my palm hard on my apron, trying not to throw up.

It hadnâ€™t been him. I knew that much. Of all the men, it couldnâ€™t have been him; he had broken his leg in the afternoon. There was no way in which he could have been that heavy, inexorable presence in the night, shoving, stinking. And yet I felt he was, and swallowed bile, my head going suddenly light.

â€œMrs. Fraser? Mrs. Fraser!â€ Malva and Mrs. Bug both spoke together, and before I knew quite what was happening, Mrs. Bug had eased me onto a stool, holding me upright, and Malva was pressing a cup of whisky urgently against my mouth.

I drank, eyes closed, trying to lose myself momentarily in the clean, pungent scent and the searing taste of it.

I remembered Jamieâ€™s fury, the night he had brought me home. Had Brown been in the room with us then, there was no doubt he would have killed the man. Would he do so now, in colder blood? I didnâ€™t know. Brown clearly thought so.

I could hear Brown crying, a low, hopeless sound. I swallowed the last of the whisky, pushed the cup away, and sat up, opening my eyes. To my vague surprise, I was crying, too.

I stood up, and wiped my face on my apron. It smelled comfortingly of butter and cinnamon and fresh applesauce, and the scent of it calmed my nausea.

â€œThe teaâ€™s ready, Mrs. Fraser,â€ Malva whispered, touching my sleeve. Her eyes were fixed on Brown, huddled miserably on the table. â€œWill ye drink it?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said. â€œGive it to him. Then fetch me some bandagesâ€”and go home.â€

I had no idea what Jamie meant to do; I had no idea what I might do, when I discovered his intent. I didnâ€™t know what to think, or how to feel. The only thing I did know for certain was that I had an injured man before me. For the moment, that would have to be enough.



FOR A LITTLE WHILE, I managed to forget who he was. Forbidding him to speak, I gritted my teeth and became absorbed in the tasks before me. He sniveled, but kept still. I cleaned, bandaged, tidied, administering impersonal comfort. But as the tasks ended, I was still left with the man, and was conscious of increasing distaste each time I touched him.

At last, I was finished, and went to wash, meticulously wiping my hands with a cloth soaked in turpentine and alcohol, cleaning under each fingernail despite the soreness. I was, I realized, behaving as though he harbored some vile contagion. But I couldnâ€™t stop myself.

Lionel Brown watched me apprehensively.

â€œWhat dâ€™ye mean to do?â€

â€œI havenâ€™t decided yet.â€ This was more or less true. It hadnâ€™t been a process of conscious decision, though my course of actionâ€”or lack of itâ€”had been determined. Jamieâ€”damn himâ€”had been right. I saw no reason to tell Lionel Brown that, though. Not yet.

He was opening his mouth, no doubt to plead with me further, but I stopped him with a sharp gesture.

â€œThere was a man with you named Donner. What do you know about him?â€

Whatever heâ€™d expected, it wasnâ€™t that. His mouth hung open a little.

â€œDonner?â€ he repeated, looking uncertain.

â€œDonâ€™t dare to tell me you donâ€™t remember him,â€ I said, my agitation making me sound fierce.

â€œOh, no, maâ€™am,â€ he assured me hastily. â€œI recall him fineâ€”just fine! Whatâ€â€”his tongue touched the raw corner of his mouthâ€”â€œwhat dâ€™ye want to know about him?â€

The main thing I wanted to know was whether he was dead or not, but Brown almost certainly didnâ€™t know that.

â€œLetâ€™s start with his full name,â€ I proposed, sitting down gingerly beside him, â€œand go from there.â€

In the event, Brown knew little more for sure about Donner than his nameâ€”which, he said, was Wendigo.

â€œWhat?â€ I said incredulously, but Brown appeared to find nothing odd in it.

â€œThatâ€™s what he said it was,â€ he said, sounding hurt that I should doubt him. â€œIndian, inâ€™t it?â€

It was. It was, to be precise, the name of a monster from the mythology of some northern tribeâ€”I couldnâ€™t recall which. Briannaâ€™s high-school class had once done a unit of Native American myths, with each child undertaking to explain and illustrate a particular story. Bree had done the Wendigo.

I recalled it only because of the accompanying picture she had drawn, which had stuck with me for some time. Done in a reverse technique, the basic drawing done in white crayon, showing through an overlay of charcoal. Trees, lashing to and fro in a swirl of snow and wind, leaf-stripped and needle-flying, the spaces between them part of the night. The picture had a sense of urgency about it, wildness and movement. It took several moments of looking at it before one glimpsed the face amid the branches. I had actually yelped and dropped the paper when I saw itâ€”much to Breeâ€™s gratification.

â€œI daresay,â€ I said, firmly suppressing the memory of the Wendigoâ€™s face. â€œWhere did he come from? Did he live in Brownsville?â€

He had stayed in Brownsville, but only for a few weeks. Hodgepile had brought him from somewhere, along with his other men. Brown had taken no notice of him; he caused no trouble.

â€œHe stayed with the widow Baudry,â€ Brown said, sounding suddenly hopeful. â€œMight be he told her something of himself. I could find out for you. When I go home.â€ He gave me a look of what I assumed he meant to be doglike trust, but which looked more like a dying newt.

â€œHmm,â€ I said, giving him a look of extreme skepticism. â€œWeâ€™ll see about that.â€

He licked his lips, trying to look pitiful.

â€œCould I maybe have some water, maâ€™am?â€

I didnâ€™t suppose I could let him die of thirst, but I had had quite enough of ministering to the man personally. I wanted him out of my surgery and out of my sight, as soon as possible. I nodded brusquely and stepped into the hall, calling for Mrs. Bug to bring some water.

The afternoon was warm, and I was feeling unpleasantly prickly after working on Lionel Brown. Without warning, a flush of heat rose suddenly upward through my chest and neck and flowed like hot wax over my face, so that sweat popped out behind my ears. Murmuring an excuse, I left the patient to Mrs. Bug, and hurried out into the welcome air.

There was a well outside; no more than a shallow pit, neatly edged with stones. A big gourd dipper was wedged between two of the stones; I pulled it out and, kneeling, scooped up enough water to drink and to splash over my steaming face.

Hot flushes in themselves were not really unpleasantâ€”rather interesting, in fact, in the same way that pregnancy was; that odd feeling as oneâ€™s body did something quite unexpected, and not within oneâ€™s conscious control. I wondered briefly whether men felt that way about erections.

At the moment, a hot flush seemed quite welcome. Surely, I told myself, I couldnâ€™t be experiencing hot flushes if I were pregnant. Or could I? I had the uneasy knowledge that the hormonal surges of early pregnancy were quite as capable of causing all kinds of peculiar thermal phenomena as were those of the menopause. I was certainly having the sorts of emotional conniptions that went with being pregnantâ€”or menopausalâ€”or from being rapedâ€”

â€œDonâ€™t be ridiculous, Beauchamp,â€ I said out loud. â€œYou know quite well youâ€™re not pregnant.â€

Hearing it gave me an odd feelingâ€”nine parts relief, one part regret. Well, perhaps nine thousand, nine hundred, and ninety-nine parts relief, to one of regretâ€”but it was still there.

The flood of sweat that sometimes followed in the wake of a hot flush, though, was something I could do without. The roots of my hair were soaked, and while the cool water on my face was lovely, waves of heat were still blooming over me, spreading like a clinging veil over chest and face and neck and scalp. Seized by impulse, I tipped half a dipperful of water down the inside of my bodice, exhaling in relief as the wetness soaked the cloth, trickling between my breasts and down over my belly, tickling cool between my legs and dripping to the ground.

I looked a mess, but Mrs. Bug wouldnâ€™t mindâ€”and the devil with what bloody Lionel Brown thought. Dabbing at my temples with the end of my apron, I made my way back to the house.

The door stood ajar, as Iâ€™d left it. I pushed it open, and the strong pure light of the afternoon shone past me, illuminating Mrs. Bug in the act of pressing a pillow over Lionel Brownâ€™s face with all her strength.

I stood blinking for a moment, so surprised that I simply couldnâ€™t translate the sight into realization. Then I darted forward with an incoherent cry and grabbed her arm.

She was terribly strong, and so focused on what she was doing that she didnâ€™t budge, veins standing out in her forehead and her face nearly purple with effort. I jerked hard on her arm, failed to dislodge her grip, and in desperation shoved her as hard as I could.

She staggered, off-balance, and I snatched the edge of the pillow, yanking it sideways, off Brownâ€™s face. She lunged back, intent on completing the job, blunt hands shoving down into the mass of the pillow and disappearing to the wrists.

I drew back a step and flung myself at her bodily. We went over with a crash, hitting the table, upsetting the bench, and ending in a tangle on the floor amid a litter of broken earthenware and the scents of mint tea and a spilled chamber pot.

I rolled, gasped for breath, pain from my cracked ribs paralyzing me for a moment. Then I gritted my teeth, pushing her away and trying to extricate myself from a snarl of skirtsâ€”and stumbled to my feet.

His hand hung limp, trailing from the table, and I grabbed his jaw, pulling back his head, and pressed my mouth fervently to his. I blew what little breath I had into him, gasped, and blew again, all the time feeling frantically for some trace of a pulse in his neck.

He was warm, the bones of his jaw, his shoulder felt normalâ€”but his flesh had a terrible slackness, the lips under mine flattening obscenely as I pressed and blew, blood from my split lip splattering everywhere, falling somehow away, so that I was forced to suck frantically to keep them sealed, breathing in hard through the corners of my mouth, fighting my ribs for enough air to blow again.

I felt someone behind meâ€”Mrs. Bugâ€”and kicked out at her. She made an effort to seize my shoulder, but I wrenched aside and her fingers slipped off. I turned round fast and hit her, as hard as I could, in the stomach, and she fell down on the floor with a loud whoof! No time to spare for her; I whirled and flung myself once more on Brown.

The chest under my hand rose reassuringly as I blewâ€”but fell abruptly as I stopped. I drew back and pounded hard with both fists, smacking the hard springiness of the sternum with enough force to bruise my own hands furtherâ€”and Brownâ€™s flesh, had he been capable of bruising any longer.

He wasnâ€™t. I blew and thumped and blew, until bloody sweat ran down my body in streams and my thighs were slick with it and my ears rang and black spots swam before my eyes with hyperventilating. Finally, I stopped. I stood panting in deep, wheezing gasps, wet hair hanging in my face, my hands throbbing in time to my pounding heart.

The bloody man was dead.

I rubbed my hands on my apron, then used it to wipe my face. My mouth was swollen and tasted of blood; I spat on the floor. I felt quite calm; the air had that peculiar sense of stillness that often accompanies a quiet death. A Carolina wren called in the wood nearby, â€œTeakettle, teakettle, teakettle!â€

I heard a small rustling noise and turned round. Mrs. Bug had righted the bench and sat down on it. She sat hunched forward, hands folded together in her lap, a small frown on her wrinkled round face as she stared intently at the body on the table. Brownâ€™s hand hung limp, fingers slightly cupped, holding shadows.

The sheet was stained over his body; that was the source of the chamber pot smell. So, heâ€™d been dead before I began my resuscitation efforts.

Another wave of heat bloomed upward, coating my skin like hot wax. I could smell my own sweat. I closed my eyes briefly, then opened them, and turned back to Mrs. Bug.

â€œWhy on earth,â€ I asked conversationally, â€œdid you do that?â€



â€œSHEâ€™S DONE WHAT?â€ Jamie stared at me uncomprehendingly, then at Mrs. Bug, who sat at the kitchen table, head bowed, her hands clasped together in front of her.

Not waiting for me to repeat what Iâ€™d said, he strode down the hall to the surgery. I heard his footsteps come to a sudden stop. There was an instantâ€™s silence, and then a heartfelt Gaelic oath. Mrs. Bugâ€™s plump shoulders rose around her ears.

The footsteps came back, more slowly. He came in, and walked to the table where she sat.

â€œO, woman, how have you dared to lay hands upon a man who was mine?â€ he asked very softly, in Gaelic.

â€œOh, sir,â€ she whispered. She was afraid to look up; she cowered under her cap, her face almost invisible. â€œIâ€”I didna mean to. Truly, sir!â€

Jamie glanced at me.

â€œShe smothered him,â€ I repeated. â€œWith a pillow.â€

â€œI think ye do not do such a thing without meaning it,â€ he said, with an edge in his voice that could have sharpened knives. â€œWhat were ye about, a boireannach, to do it?â€

The round shoulders began to quiver with fright.

â€œOh, sir, oh, sir! I ken â€™twas wrongâ€”only . . . only it was the wicked tongue of him. All the time I had care of him, heâ€™d cower and tremble, aye, when you or the young one came to speak to him, even Archâ€”but meâ€”â€ She swallowed, the flesh of her face seeming suddenly loose. â€œIâ€™m no but a woman, he could speak his mind to me, and he did. Threatening, sir, and cursing most awfully. He saidâ€”he said as how his brother would come, him and his men, to free him, and would slaughter us all in our blood and burn the houses over our heids.â€ Her jowls trembled as she spoke, but she found the courage to look up and meet Jamieâ€™s eyes.

â€œI kent yeâ€™d never let that happen, sir, and did my best to pay him no mind. And when he did get under my skin enough, I told him heâ€™d be deid long before his brother heard where he was. But then the wicked wee cur escapedâ€”and Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ve no idea how â€™twas done, for Iâ€™d have sworn he was in no condition even to rise from the bed, let alone come so far, but he did, and threw himself upon your wifeâ€™s mercy, and she took him upâ€”I would have dragged his evil carcass away myself, but she wouldna have itâ€”â€ Here she darted a briefly resentful glance at me, but returned an imploring gaze to Jamie almost at once.

â€œAnd she took him to mend, sweet gracious lady that she is, sirâ€”and I could see it in her face, that having tended him so, it was coming to her that she couldna bear to see him killed. And he saw it, too, the gobshite, and when she went out, he jeered at me, saying now he was safe, heâ€™d fooled her into tending him and sheâ€™d never let him be killed, and directly he was free of the place, heâ€™d have a score of men down upon us like vengeance itself, and then . . .â€ She closed her eyes, swaying briefly, and pressed a hand to her chest.

â€œI couldnâ€™t help it, sir,â€ she said very simply. â€œI really couldnâ€™t.â€

Jamie had been attending to her, a look like thunder on his brow. At this point, he glanced sharply at meâ€”and evidently saw corroborative evidence upon my own battered features. His lips pressed tight together.

â€œGo home,â€ he said to Mrs. Bug. â€œTell your husband what you have done, and send him to me.â€

He turned on his heel then, and headed for his study. Not looking at me, Mrs. Bug rose awkwardly to her feet and went out, walking like a blind woman.



â€œYOU WERE RIGHT. Iâ€™m sorry.â€ I stood stiffly in the door of the study, hand on the jamb.

Jamie was sitting with his elbows on his desk, head resting on his hands, but looked up at this, blinking.

â€œDid I not forbid ye to be sorry, Sassenach?â€ he said, and gave me a lopsided smile. Then his eyes traveled over me, and a look of concern came over his face.

â€œChrist, ye look like yeâ€™re going to fall down, Claire,â€ he said, getting up hastily. â€œCome and sit.â€

He put me in his chair, and hovered over me.

â€œIâ€™d call Mrs. Bug to bring ye something,â€ he said, â€œbut as Iâ€™ve sent her away . . . shall I bring ye a cup of tea, Sassenach?â€

Iâ€™d been feeling like crying, but laughed instead, blinking back tears.

â€œWe havenâ€™t got any. We havenâ€™t had for months. Iâ€™m all right. Just ratherâ€”rather shocked.â€

â€œAye, I suppose so. Yeâ€™re bleeding a bit.â€ He pulled a crumpled handkerchief from his pocket and, bending over, dabbed my mouth, his brows drawn together in an anxious frown.

I sat still and let him, fighting a sudden wave of exhaustion. All at once, I wanted nothing save to lie down, go to sleep, and never wake up again. And if I did wake up, I wanted the dead man in my surgery to be gone. I also wanted the house not to be burned over our heads.

But it isnâ€™t time, I thought suddenly, and found that thoughtâ€”idiotic as it wasâ€”obscurely comforting.

â€œWill it make things harder for you?â€ I asked, struggling to fight off the weariness and think sensibly. â€œWith Richard Brown?â€

â€œI dinna ken,â€ he admitted. â€œIâ€™ve been trying to think. I could wish we were in Scotland,â€ he said a little ruefully. â€œIâ€™d ken better what Brown might do, were he a Scotsman.â€

â€œOh, really? Say you were dealing with your uncle Colum, for instance,â€ I suggested. â€œWhat would he do, do you think?â€

â€œTry to kill me and get his brother back,â€ he replied promptly. â€œIf he kent I had him. And if your Donner did go back to Brownsvilleâ€”Richard knows by now.â€

He was entirely right, and the knowledge made small fingers of apprehension creep briskly up my back.

The worry evidently showed on my face, for he smiled a little.

â€œDinna fash yourself, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œThe Lindsay brothers left for Brownsville the morning after we came back. Kennyâ€™s keeping an eye on the town, and Evan and Murdo are waiting at points along the road, with fresh horses. If Richard Brown and his bloody Committee of Safety should come this way, weâ€™ll hear of it in good time.â€

That was reassuring, and I sat up a little straighter.

â€œThatâ€™s good. Butâ€”even if Donner did go back, he wouldnâ€™t know that you had Lionel Brown captive; you might have killed him d-during the fight.â€

He flicked a narrow blue glance at me, but merely nodded.

â€œI could wish I had,â€ he said with a slight grimace. â€œIt would have saved trouble. But thenâ€”Iâ€™d not have found out what they were doing, and I did need to know that. If Donnerâ€™s gone back, though, heâ€™ll haâ€™ told Richard Brown what happened, and led them back to claim the bodies. Heâ€™ll see his brotherâ€™s no among them.â€

â€œWhereupon heâ€™ll draw the logical conclusion and come here looking for him.â€

The sound of the back door opening at this point made me jump, heart pounding, but it was succeeded by the soft shuffle of moccasined feet in the hall, announcing Young Ian, who peered inquiringly into the study.

â€œIâ€™ve just met Mrs. Bug, hurrying off to her house,â€ he said, frowning. â€œShe wouldna stop and speak to me, and she looked verra queer indeed. Whatâ€™s amiss?â€

â€œWhat isnâ€™t?â€ I said, and laughed, causing him to glance sharply at me.

Jamie sighed.

â€œSit,â€ he said, pushing a stool toward Ian with one foot. â€œAnd Iâ€™ll tell ye.â€

Ian listened with great attention, though his mouth fell open a little when Jamie reached the point about Mrs. Bug putting the pillow over Brownâ€™s face.

â€œIs he still there?â€ he asked, at the end of the tale. He hunched a little, looking suspiciously back over his shoulder, as though expecting Brown to come through the surgery door at any moment.

â€œWell, I hardly think heâ€™s going anywhere under his own steam,â€ I observed tartly.

Ian nodded, but got up to look anyway. He came back in a moment, looking thoughtful.

â€œHeâ€™s no marks on him,â€ he said to Jamie, sitting down.

Jamie nodded. â€œAye, and heâ€™s freshly bandaged. Your auntie had just tended him.â€

They exchanged nods, both obviously thinking the same thing.

â€œYe canna tell by looking that heâ€™s been killed, Auntie,â€ Ian explained, seeing that I was not yet on their wavelength. â€œHe might have died of himself.â€

â€œI suppose you could say that he did. If he hadnâ€™t tried to terrorize Mrs. Bug . . .â€ I rubbed a handâ€”gentlyâ€”over my forehead, where a headache was beginning to throb.

â€œHow do ye feelâ€”â€ Ian began, in a worried tone, but I had quite suddenly had more than enough of people asking me how I felt.

â€œI scarcely know,â€ I said abruptly, dropping my hand. I looked down at my fists, curled in my lap.

â€œHeâ€”he wasnâ€™t a wicked man, I donâ€™t think,â€ I said. There was a splotch of blood on my apron. I didnâ€™t know whether it was his or mine. â€œJust . . . terribly weak.â€

â€œBetter off dead then,â€ said Jamie matter-of-factly, and without any particular malice. Ian nodded in agreement.

â€œWell, so.â€ Jamie returned to the point of the discussion. â€œI was just saying to your auntie, if Brown were a Scot, I should better know how to deal with himâ€”but then it struck me, that while he isna Scottish, he is by way of doing business in a Scottish manner. Him and his committee. Theyâ€™re like a Watch.â€

Ian nodded, sketchy brows raised.

â€œSo they are.â€ He looked interested. â€œIâ€™ve never seen one, but Mam told meâ€”about the one that arrested you, Uncle Jamie, and how she and Auntie Claire went after them.â€ He grinned at me, his gaunt face suddenly transforming to show a hint of the boy heâ€™d been.

â€œWell, I was younger then,â€ I said. â€œAnd braver.â€

Jamie made a small noise in his throat that might have been amusement.

â€œTheyâ€™re no verra thrifty about it,â€ he said. â€œKilling and burning, I meanâ€”â€

â€œAs opposed to ongoing extortion.â€ I was beginning to see where he was going with this. Ian had been born after Culloden; heâ€™d never seen a Watch, one of those organized bands of armed men that rode the country, charging fees from the Highland chiefs to protect tenants, land, and cattleâ€”and if the black rent they charged was not paid, promptly seizing goods and cattle themselves. I had. And in all truth, Iâ€™d heard of them burning and killing now and then, tooâ€”though generally only to create an example and improve cooperation.

Jamie nodded. â€œWell, Brownâ€™s no Scot, as I said. But business is business, isnâ€™t it?â€ A contemplative look had come over his face, and he leaned back a little, hands linked over one knee. â€œHow fast can ye get to Anidonau Nuya, Ian?â€



AFTER IAN LEFT, we stayed in the study. The situation in my surgery would have to be dealt with, but I was not quite ready yet to go and face it. Beyond a minor remark to the effect that it was a pity he had not yet had time to build an icehouse, Jamie made no reference to it, either.

â€œPoor old Mrs. Bug,â€ I said, beginning to get a grip. â€œIâ€™d no idea heâ€™d been playing on her that way. He must have thought she was a soft touch.â€ I laughed weakly. â€œThat was a mistake. Sheâ€™s terribly strong. I was amazed.â€

I shouldnâ€™t have been; Iâ€™d seen Mrs. Bug walk for a mile with a full-grown goat across her shouldersâ€”but somehow one never translates the strength required for daily farm life into a capacity for homicidal fury.

â€œSo was I,â€ Jamie said dryly. â€œNot that she was strong enough to do it, but that she dared take matters into her own hands. Why did she no tell Arch, if not myself?â€

â€œI suppose itâ€™s what she saidâ€”she thought it wasnâ€™t her place to say anything; youâ€™d given her the job of looking after him, and sheâ€™d move heaven and earth to do anything you asked. I daresay she thought she was coping well enough, but when he showed up that way, she . . . just snapped. It does happen; Iâ€™ve seen it.â€

â€œSo have I,â€ he muttered. A small frown had formed, deepening the crease between his brows, and I wondered what violent incidents he might be recalling. â€œBut I shouldna have thought . . .â€

Arch Bug came in so quietly that I didnâ€™t hear him; I only realized that he was there when I saw Jamie look up, stiffening. I whirled about, and saw the ax in Archâ€™s hand. I opened my mouth to speak, but he strode toward Jamie, taking no notice of his surroundings. Clearly, for him, there was no one in the room save Jamie.

He reached the desk and laid the ax upon it, almost gently.

â€œMy life for hers, O, chieftain,â€ he said quietly in Gaelic. He stepped back then, and knelt, head bowed. He had braided his soft white hair in a narrow plait and bound it up, so that the back of his neck was left bare. It was walnut-brown and deeply seamed from weather, but still thick and muscular above the white band of his collar.

A tiny noise from the door made me turn from the scene, riveting as it was. Mrs. Bug was there, clinging to the jamb for support, and in obvious need of it. Her cap was askew, and sweaty strands of iron-gray hair stuck to a face the color of cream gone bad.

Her eyes flickered to me when I moved, but then shot back to fix again upon her kneeling husbandâ€”and on Jamie, who was now standing, looking from Arch to his wife, then back again. He rubbed a finger slowly up and down the bridge of his nose, eyeing Arch.

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said mildly. â€œIâ€™m to take your head, am I? Here in my own room and have your wife mop up the blood, or shall I do it in the dooryard, and nail ye up by the hair over my lintel as a warning to Richard Brown? Get up, ye auld fraudster.â€

Everything in the room was frozen for an instantâ€”long enough for me to notice the tiny black mole in the exact middle of Archâ€™s neckâ€”and then the old man rose, very slowly.

â€œIt is your right,â€ he said, in Gaelic. â€œI am your tacksman, a ceann-cinnidh, I swear by my iron; it is your right.â€ He stood very straight, but his eyes were hooded, fixed on the desk where his ax lay, the sharpened edge a silver line against the dull gray metal of the head.

Jamie drew breath to reply, but then stopped, eyeing the old man narrowly. Something changed in him, some awareness taking hold.

â€œA ceann-cinnidh?â€ he said, and Arch Bug nodded, silent.

The air of the room had thickened in a heartbeat, and the hairs prickled on the back of my own neck.

â€œA ceann-cinnidh,â€ Arch had said. O, chieftain. One word, and we stood in Scotland. It was easy to see the difference in attitude between Jamieâ€™s new tenants and his Ardsmuir menâ€”the difference of a loyalty of agreement and one of acknowledgment. This was different still: an older allegiance, which had ruled the Highlands for a thousand years. The oath of blood and iron.

I saw Jamie weigh the present and the past and realize where Arch Bug stood between them. I saw it in his face, exasperation changing to realizationâ€”and saw his shoulders drop a little, in acceptance.

â€œBy your word, then, it is my right,â€ he said softly, also in Gaelic. He drew himself up, picked up the ax, and held it out, handle first. â€œAnd by that right, I give you back your womanâ€™s lifeâ€”and your own.â€

Mrs. Bug let out a small sobbing breath. Arch didnâ€™t look round at her, but reached out and took the ax, with a grave inclination of the head. He turned then, and walked out without a further wordâ€”though I saw the fingers of his maimed hand brush his wifeâ€™s sleeve, very softly, in passing.

Mrs. Bug straightened herself, hastily tucking up the straggling bits of hair with trembling fingers. Jamie didnâ€™t look at her, but sat down again, and took up his quill and a sheet of paper, though I thought he had no intention of writing anything. Not wanting to embarrass her, I affected great interest in the bookshelf, picking up Jamieâ€™s little cherrywood snake as though to examine it more closely.

Cap on straight now, she came into the room, and bobbed a curtsy in front of him.

â€œWill I fetch ye a bit to eat, sir? Thereâ€™s bannocks made fresh.â€ She spoke with great dignity, head upright. He raised his own head from his paper, and smiled at her.

â€œI should like that,â€ he said. â€œGun robh math agaibh, a nighean.â€

She nodded smartly and turned on her heel. At the door, though, she paused, looking back. Jamie raised his brows.

â€œI was there, ken,â€ she said, fixing him with a direct look. â€œWhen the Sassenachs killed your grandsire, there on Tower Hill. There was a lot of blood.â€ She pursed her lips, examining him through narrowed, reddened eyes, then relaxed.

â€œYeâ€™re a credit to him,â€ she said, and was gone in a whisk of petticoats and apron strings.

Jamie looked at me in surprise, and I shrugged.

â€œIt wasnâ€™t necessarily a compliment, you know,â€ I said, and his shoulders began to shake in silent laughter.

â€œI know,â€ he said at last, and swiped a knuckle beneath his nose. â€œDâ€™ye ken, Sassenachâ€”sometimes I mourn the auld bastard?â€ He shook his head. â€œSometime I must ask Mrs. Bug if itâ€™s true what he said, at the last. What they say he said, I mean.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€

â€œHe gave the headsman his fee, and told him to do a good jobâ€”â€˜For I shall be very angry indeed if ye donâ€™t.â€™â€

â€œWell, it certainly sounds like something he would say,â€ I said, smiling a little. â€œWhat do you suppose the Bugs were doing in London?â€

He shook his head again, and turned his face to me, lifting his chin so the sun from the window glimmered like water along his jaw and cheekbone.

â€œGod knows. Dâ€™ye think sheâ€™s right, Sassenach? About me being like him?â€

â€œNot to look at,â€ I said, smiling a little. The late Simon, Lord Lovat, had been short and squat, though powerfully built despite his age. He had also borne a strong resemblance to a malevolentâ€”but very cleverâ€”toad.

â€œNo,â€ Jamie agreed. â€œThank God. But otherwise?â€ The light of humor was still in his eyes, but he was serious; he truly wanted to know.

I studied him thoughtfully. There was no trace of the Old Fox in his bold, clean-cut featuresâ€”those had come mostly from his motherâ€™s MacKenzie sideâ€”nor yet in the broad-shouldered height of him, but somewhere behind those slanted dark blue eyes, I now and then sensed a faint echo of Lord Lovatâ€™s deep-set gaze, glittering with interest and sardonic humor.

â€œYou have something of him,â€ I admitted. â€œMore than a little, sometimes. You havenâ€™t the overweening ambition, but . . .â€ I squinted a bit, considering. â€œI was going to say that you arenâ€™t as ruthless as him,â€ I went on slowly, â€œbut you are, really.â€

â€œAm I, then?â€ He didnâ€™t seem either surprised or put out to hear this.

â€œYou can be,â€ I said, and felt somewhere in the marrow of my bones the popping sound of Arvin Hodgepileâ€™s neck breaking. It was a warm afternoon, but gooseflesh rippled suddenly up my arms, and then was gone.

â€œHave I the devious nature, dâ€™ye think?â€ he asked seriously.

â€œI donâ€™t know, quite,â€ I said with some dubiousness. â€œYouâ€™re not a proper twister like he wasâ€”but that may be only because youâ€™ve a sense of honor that he lacked. You donâ€™t use people like he did.â€

He smiled at that, but with less real humor than heâ€™d shown before.

â€œOh, but I do, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s only I try not to let it show.â€

He sat for a moment, his gaze fixed on the little cherrywood snake that I held, but I didnâ€™t think he was looking at it. At last, he shook his head and looked up at me, the corner of his mouth tucking wryly in.

â€œIf there is a heaven, and my grandsireâ€™s in itâ€”and I take leave to doubt that lastâ€”heâ€™s laughing his wicked auld head off now. Or he would be, if it werenâ€™t tucked underneath his arm.â€

THE EXHIBITS IN THE CASE




AND SO IT WAS that several days later, we rode into Brownsville. Jamie, in full Highland regalia, with Hector Cameronâ€™s gold-knurled dirk at his waist and a hawkâ€™s feather in his bonnet. On Gideon, who had his ears laid back and blood in his eye, as usual.

By his side, Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning, peace chief of the Snowbird Cherokee. Bird, Ian told me, was from the Long Hair clan, and looked it. His hair was not only long and glossily anointed with bear fat, but most resplendently dressed, with a high tail twisted up from the crown of his head and dropping down his back, ending in a dozen tiny braids decoratedâ€”like the rest of his costumeâ€”with wampum shell beads, glass beads, small brass bells, parakeet feathers, and a Chinese yen; God knew where heâ€™d got that. Slung by his saddle, his newest and most prized possessionâ€”Jamieâ€™s rifle.

By Jamieâ€™s other side, meâ€”Exhibit A. On my mule Clarence, dressed and cloaked in indigo woolâ€”which played up the paleness of my skin and beautifully highlighted the yellow and green of the healing bruises on my faceâ€”with my necklace of freshwater pearls about my neck for moral support.

Ian rode behind us with the two braves Bird had brought as retinue, looking more like an Indian than a Scot, with the semicircles of tattooed dots that swooped across his tanned cheekbones, and his own long brown hair greased back from his face and tied in a knot, a single turkey quill thrust through it. At least he hadnâ€™t plucked his scalp in the Mohawk fashion; he looked sufficiently menacing without that.

And on a travois behind Ianâ€™s horse rode Exhibit Bâ€”the corpse of Lionel Brown. Weâ€™d put him in the springhouse to keep cool with the butter and eggs, and Bree and Malva had done their best, packing the body with moss to absorb liquids, adding as many strongly aromatic herbs as they could find, then wrapping the unsavory package in a deerâ€™s hide, bound with rawhide strips in the Indian fashion. Despite this attention, none of the horses was enthusiastic about being anywhere near it, but Ianâ€™s mount was grimly acquiescent, merely snorting loudly every few minutes and shaking his head so his harness rattled, a lugubrious counterpoint to the soft thump of hooves.

We didnâ€™t talk much.

Visitors to any mountain settlement were cause for public notice and comment. Our little entourage brought folk popping out of their houses like winkles on pins, mouths agape. By the time we reached Richard Brownâ€™s house, which doubled as the local tavern, we had a small band of followers, mostly men and boys.

The sound of our arrival brought a womanâ€”Mrs. Brown, I recognized herâ€”out onto the crudely built stoop. Her hand flew to her mouth, and she rushed back into the house.

We waited in silence. It was a cool, bright autumn day, and the breeze stirred the hair on my neck; Iâ€™d worn it pulled back, at Jamieâ€™s request, and wore no cap. My face was exposed, the truth written on it.

Did they know? Feeling strangely remote, as though I watched from somewhere outside my own body, I looked from face to face among the crowd.

They couldnâ€™t know. Jamie had assured me of it; I knew it, myself. Unless Donner had escaped, and come to tell them all that had happened during that final night. But he hadnâ€™t. If he had, Richard Brown would have come to us.

All they knew was what showed on my face. And that was too much.

Clarence felt the hysteria that quivered under my skin like a pool of mercury; he stamped, once, and shook his head as though wanting to dislodge flies in his ears.

The door opened, and Richard Brown came out. There were several men behind him, all armed.

Brown was pale, unkempt, with a sprouting beard and greasy hair. His eyes were red and bleared, and a miasma of beer seemed to surround him. Heâ€™d been drinking heavily, and was plainly trying to pull himself together enough to deal with whatever threat we represented.

â€œFraser,â€ he said, and stopped, blinking.

â€œMr. Brown.â€ Jamie nudged Gideon closer, so he was at eye level with the men on the porch, no more than six feet from Richard Brown.

â€œTen days past,â€ Jamie said levelly, â€œa band of men came upon my land. They stole my property, assaulted my daughter who is with child, burnt my malting shed, destroyed my grain, and abducted and abused my wife.â€

Half the men had been staring at me already; now all of them were. I heard the small, metallic click of a pistol being cocked. I kept my face immobile, my hands steady on the reins, my eyes fixed on Richard Brownâ€™s face.

Brownâ€™s mouth began to work, but before he could speak, Jamie raised a hand, commanding silence.

â€œI followed them, with my men, and killed them,â€ he said, in the same level tone. â€œI found your brother with them. I took him captive, but did not slay him.â€

There was a general intake of breath, and uneasy murmurs from the crowd behind us. Richard Brownâ€™s eyes darted to the bundle on the travois, and his face went white under the scabby beard.

â€œYouâ€”â€ he croaked. â€œNelly?â€

This was my cue. I took a deep breath and nudged Clarence forward.

â€œYour brother suffered an accident before my husband found us,â€ I said. My voice was hoarse, but clear enough. I forced more air into it, to be heard by everyone. â€œHe was badly injured in a fall. We tended his injuries. But he died.â€

Jamie let a moment of stunned silence pass, before continuing.

â€œWe have brought him to you, so that you may bury him.â€ He made a small gesture, and Ian, who had dismounted, cut the ropes that held the travois. He and the two Cherokee pulled it to the porch and left it lying in the rutted road, returning silently to their horses.

Jamie inclined his head sharply, and swung Gideonâ€™s head around. Bird followed him, pleasantly impassive as the Buddha. I didnâ€™t know whether he understood enough English to have followed Jamieâ€™s speech, but it didnâ€™t matter. He understood his role, and had carried it out perfectly.

The Browns might have had a profitable sideline in murder, theft, and slavery, but their chief income lay in trade with the Indians. By his presence at Jamieâ€™s side, Bird gave clear warning that the Cherokee regarded their relationship with the King of England and his agent as more important than trade with the Browns. Harm Jamie or his property again, and that profitable connection would be broken.

I didnâ€™t know everything Ian had said to Bird, when asking him to comeâ€”but I thought it quite likely that there was also an unspoken agreement that no formal inquiry would be made on behalf of the Crown into the fate of any captives who might have passed into Indian hands.

This was, after all, a matter of business.

I kicked Clarence in the ribs and wheeled into place behind Bird, keeping my eyes firmly fixed on the Chinese yen that glinted in the middle of his back, dangling from his hair on a scarlet thread. I had an almost uncontrollable urge to look back, and clenched my hands on the reins, digging my fingernails into my palms.

Was Donner dead, after all? He wasnâ€™t among the men with Richard Brown; Iâ€™d looked.

I didnâ€™t know whether I wanted him to be dead. The desire to find out more about him was strongâ€”but the desire to be done with the matter, to leave that night on the mountainside behind once and for all, all witnesses safely consigned to the silence of the graveâ€”that was stronger.

I heard Ian and the two Cherokee come into line behind us, and within moments, we were out of sight of Brownsville, though the scent of beer and chimney smoke lingered in my nostrils. I pushed Clarence up beside Jamie; Bird had fallen back to ride with his men and Ian; they were laughing at something.

â€œWill this be the end of it?â€ I asked. My voice felt thin in the cold air, and I wasnâ€™t sure heâ€™d heard me. But he did. He shook his head slightly.

â€œThere is never an end to such things,â€ he said quietly. â€œBut we are alive. And that is good.â€





PART FIVE




Great Unexpectations





35




Laminaria




SAFELY RETURNED from Brownsville, I took firm steps to resume normal life. And among these was a visit to Marsali, who had returned from her refuge with the McGillivrays. Iâ€™d seen Fergus, who had assured me that she was well recovered from her injuries and feeling wellâ€”but I needed to see for myself.

The homestead was in good order, I saw, but showing certain signs of dilapidation; a few shingles had blown off the roof, one corner of the stoop was sagging, and the oiled parchment over the single window had split partway up, the flaw hastily mended with rag stuffed through the hole. Small things, but things that should be dealt with before the snow cameâ€”and it was coming; I could feel the touch of it in the air, the brilliant blue sky of late autumn fading into the hazy gray of oncoming winter.

No one rushed out to meet me, but I knew they were home; there was a cloud of smoke and sparks from the chimney, and I thought tartly that at least Fergus seemed able to provide enough wood for the hearth. I called out a cheery â€œhallooo!â€ and pushed open the door.

I had the feeling at once. I didnâ€™t trust most of my feelings at the moment, but that one went bone-deep. Itâ€™s the feeling you have, as a doctor, when you walk into an examination room and know that somethingâ€™s very wrong. Before you ask the first question, before youâ€™ve taken the first vital sign. It doesnâ€™t happen often, and youâ€™d rather it never didâ€”but there it is. You know, and thereâ€™s no way round it.

It was the children that told me, as much as anything else. Marsali sat by the window, sewing, the two girls playing quietly close by her feet. Germainâ€”uncharacteristically indoorsâ€”sat swinging his legs at the table, frowning at a ragged but treasured picture book Jamie had brought him from Cross Creek. They knew, too.

Marsali looked up when I came in, and I saw her face tighten in shock at sight of mineâ€”though it was much better than it had been.

â€œIâ€™m fine,â€ I said briskly, stopping her exclamation. â€œOnly bruises. How are you, though?â€

I set down my bag and cupped my hands round her face, turning it gently to the light. One cheek and ear were badly bruised, and there was a fading knot on her foreheadâ€”but she wasnâ€™t cut, and her eyes looked back at me, clear and healthy. A good color to her skin, no jaundice, no faint scent of kidney dysfunction.

Sheâ€™s all right. Itâ€™s the baby, I thought, and dropped my hands to her middle without asking. My heart felt cold as I cupped the bulge and lifted gently. I nearly bit my tongue in surprise when a small knee shifted in answer to my touch.

I was terribly heartened at that; I had thought the child might be dead. A quick glance at Marsaliâ€™s face muted my relief. She was strained between hope and fear, hoping that I would tell her that what she knew to be true wasnâ€™t.

â€œHas the baby moved very much, these last few days?â€ I asked, keeping my voice calm as I went about fetching out my stethoscope. Iâ€™d had it made by a pewtersmith in Wilmingtonâ€”a small bell with a flat end piece; primitive, but effective.

â€œNot so much as he did,â€ Marsali answered, leaning back to let me listen to her stomach. â€œBut they donâ€™t, do they, when theyâ€™re nearly ready to come? Joanie lay like the deâ€”like a millstone, all the night before the waters broke.â€

â€œWell, yes, often they do do that,â€ I agreed, ignoring what sheâ€™d nearly said. â€œResting up, I suppose.â€ She smiled in response, but the smile vanished like a snowflake on a griddle as I leaned close and put my ear to the flattened end of the flared metal tube, the wide, bell-shaped opening over her stomach.

It took some time to pick up the heartbeat, and when I did, it was unusually slow. It was also skipping beats; the hair on my arms rippled with gooseflesh when I heard it.

I went on with the examination, asking questions, making small jokes, pausing to answer questions from the other children, who were crowding round, stepping on each otherâ€™s feet and getting in the wayâ€”and all the time, my mind was racing, envisioning possibilities, all bad.

The child was movingâ€”but wrong. Heartbeat was thereâ€”but wrong. Everything about that belly felt wrong to me. What was it, though? Umbilical cord around the neck was thoroughly possible, and quite dangerous.

I pushed the smock further back, trying for a better listen, and saw the heavy bruisingâ€”ugly splotches of healing green and yellow, a few still with deep red-black centers that bloomed like deadly roses over the curve of her belly. My teeth sank into my lip at sight of them; theyâ€™d kicked her, the bastards. A wonder she hadnâ€™t miscarried on the spot.

Anger swelled suddenly under my breastbone, a huge, solid thing, pushing hard enough to burst it.

Was she bleeding at all? No. No pain, bar tenderness from the bruises. No cramping. No contractions. Her blood pressure seemed normal, so far as I could tell.

A cord accident was still possibleâ€”likely, even. But it could be a partially detached placenta, bleeding into the uterus. A ruptured uterus? Or something rarerâ€”a dead twin, an abnormal growth . . . The only thing I knew for sure was that the child needed to be delivered into the air-breathing world, and as soon as possible.

â€œWhereâ€™s Fergus?â€ I said, still speaking calmly.

â€œI dinna ken,â€ she said, matching my tone of absolute calm. â€œHeâ€™s no been home since the day before yesterday. Dinna put that in your mouth, a chuisle.â€ She lifted a hand toward FÃ©licitÃ©, who was gnawing a candle stub, but couldnâ€™t reach her.

â€œHasnâ€™t he? Well, weâ€™ll find him.â€ I removed the candle stub; FÃ©licitÃ© made no protest, aware that something was going on, but not knowing what. In search of reassurance, she seized her motherâ€™s leg and began determinedly trying to climb up into Marsaliâ€™s nonexistent lap.

â€œNo, bÃ©bÃ©,â€ Germain said, and clasped his sister round the waist, dragging her backward. â€œYou come with me, a piuthar. Want milkie?â€ he added, coaxing. â€œWeâ€™ll go to the springhoose, aye?â€

â€œWant Mama!â€ FÃ©licitÃ© windmilled arms and legs, trying to escape, but Germain hoisted her fat little body into his arms.

â€œYou wee lassies come with me,â€ he said firmly, and trundled awkwardly out the door, FÃ©licitÃ© grunting and squirming in his grasp, Joanie scampering at his heelsâ€”pausing at the door to look back at Marsali, her big brown eyes wide and scared.

â€œGo on then, a muirninn,â€ Marsali called, smiling. â€œTake them to see Mrs. Bug. It will be all right.

â€œHeâ€™s a sweet lad, Germain,â€ Marsali murmured, folding her hands across her belly as the smile faded.

â€œVery sweet,â€ I agreed. â€œMarsaliâ€”â€

â€œI know,â€ she said simply. â€œMight this one live, dâ€™ye think?â€ She passed a hand gently over her belly, looking down.

I wasnâ€™t at all sure, but the child was alive for the moment. I hesitated, turning over possibilities in my mind. Anything I did would entail hideous riskâ€”to her, the child, or both.

Why had I not come sooner? I berated myself for taking Jamieâ€™s and then Fergusâ€™s word that she was all right, but there was no time for self-reproachâ€”and it might not have mattered, either.

â€œCan you walk?â€ I asked. â€œWeâ€™ll need to go to the Big House.â€

â€œAye, of course.â€ She rose carefully, holding to my arm. She looked around the cabin, as though memorizing all its homely details, then gave me a sharp, clear glance. â€œWeâ€™ll talk on the way.â€



THERE WERE OPTIONS, most of them horrifying to contemplate. If there was danger of a placental abruption, I could do an emergency cesarean and possibly save the childâ€”but Marsali would die. To deliver the child slowly, via induction of labor, was to risk the child, but was much safer for Marsali. Of courseâ€”and I kept this thought to myselfâ€”induction of labor raised the risk of hemorrhage. If that happened . . .

I could perhaps stop the bleeding and save Marsaliâ€”but would be unable to help the infant, who would likely also be in distress. There was the ether . . . a tempting thought, but I reluctantly put it aside. It was etherâ€”but Iâ€™d not used it, had no clear idea of its concentration or effectiveness, nor did I have anything like an anesthetistâ€™s training that would allow me to calculate its effects in such a dicey situation as dangerous childbirth. For a minor operation, I could go slowly, judge the patientâ€™s respiration, and simply back off if things seemed to be going wrong. If I were in the middle of a cesarean section and things went pear-shaped, there was no way out.

Marsali seemed preternaturally calm, as though she were listening to what was going on inside rather than to my explanations and speculations. As we came near the Big House, though, we met Young Ian, coming down the hillside with a clutch of dead rabbits, dangling by their ears, and she sharpened to attention.

â€œHo, cousin! How is it, then?â€ he asked cheerfully.

â€œI need Fergus, Ian,â€ she said without preliminary. â€œCan ye find him?â€

The smile faded from his face as he took in Marsaliâ€™s paleness, and my support of her.

â€œChrist, the bairnâ€™s coming? But whyâ€”â€ He glanced up the pathway behind us, clearly wondering why we had left Marsaliâ€™s cabin.

â€œGo and find Fergus, Ian,â€ I cut in. â€œNow.â€

â€œOh.â€ He swallowed, suddenly looking quite young. â€œOh. Aye. I will. Directly!â€ He began to bound off, then whirled back and thrust the rabbits into my hand. Then he leapt off the path and tore down the hillside, rocketing between trees and vaulting fallen logs. Rollo, not wishing to be left out of anything, flashed past in a gray blur and hurtled down the hillside after his master like a falling rock.

â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ I said, patting Marsaliâ€™s arm. â€œTheyâ€™ll find him.â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ she said, looking after them. â€œIf they shouldna find him in time, though . . .â€

â€œThey will,â€ I said firmly. â€œCome on.â€



I SENT LIZZIE to find Brianna and Malva Christieâ€”I thought I might well need more handsâ€”and sent Marsali to the kitchen to rest with Mrs. Bug, while I readied the surgery. Fresh bedding and pillows, spread on my examination table. A bed would be better, but I needed to have my equipment to hand.

And the equipment itself: the surgical instruments, carefully hidden beneath a clean towel; the ether mask, lined with fresh thick gauze; the dropping bottleâ€”could I trust Malva to administer the ether, if I had to perform emergency surgery? I thought perhaps I could; the girl was very young, and quite untrained, but she had a remarkable coolness about her, and I knew she wasnâ€™t squeamish. I filled the dropping bottle, averting my face from the sweet, thick scent that drifted from the liquid, and put a small twist of cotton in the spout, to keep the ether from evaporating and gassing us allâ€”or catching fire. I glanced hastily at the hearth, but the fire was out.

What if labor was prolonged and then things went wrongâ€”if I had to do this at night, by candlelight? I couldnâ€™t; ether was hideously inflammable. I shoved away the mental picture of myself performing an emergency cesarean section in the pitch-dark, by feel.

â€œIf you have a moment to spare, this would be a bloody good time to have a look-in,â€ I muttered, addressing this remark collectively to Saints Bride, Raymond, and Margaret of Antioch, all presumably patrons of childbirth and expectant mothers, plus any guardian angelsâ€”mine, Marsaliâ€™s, or the childâ€™sâ€”who might be hovering about in the offing.

Evidently, someone was listening. When I got Marsali boosted up onto the table, I was terribly relieved to find that the cervix had begun to dilateâ€”but there was no sign of bleeding. It didnâ€™t remove the risk of hemorrhage, by any means, but it did mean the probability was much lower.

Her blood pressure seemed all right, so far as I could tell by looking at her, and the babyâ€™s heartbeat had steadied, though the baby had stopped moving, refusing to respond to pokes and shoves.

â€œSound asleep, I expect,â€ I said, smiling at Marsali. â€œResting up.â€

She gave me a tiny smile in return, and turned onto her side, grunting like a hog.

â€œI could use a bit of a rest, myself, after that walk.â€ She sighed, settling her head into the pillow. Adso, seconding this motion, leapt up onto the table, and curled himself into her breasts, rubbing his face affectionately against her.

I would have slung him out, but Marsali seemed to find some comfort in his presence, scratching his ears until he curled up under her chin, purring madly. Well, Iâ€™d delivered children in much less sanitary surroundings, cat notwithstanding, and this was likely to be a slow process; Adso would have decamped long before his presence became a hindrance.

I was feeling a bit more reassured, but not to the point of confidence. That subtle feeling of wrongness was still there. On the way, Iâ€™d considered the various options available to me; given the slight dilatation of the cervix and the now-steady heartbeat, I thought we might try the most conservative method of inducing labor, so as not to put undue stress upon mother or child. If emergency intervened . . . well, weâ€™d deal with that when and if we had to.

I only hoped the contents of the jar were usable; Iâ€™d never had occasion to open it before. Laminaria, said the label, written in Daniel Rawlingsâ€™s flowing script. It was a small jar of dark green glass, corked tight, and very light. When I opened it, a faint whiff of iodine floated out, but no scent of decay, thank goodness.

Laminaria is seaweed. Dried, itâ€™s no more than paper-thin slips of brownish-green. Unlike many dried seaweeds, though, Laminaria doesnâ€™t crumble easily. And it has a most astonishing capacity to absorb water.

Inserted into the opening of the cervix, it absorbs moisture from the mucous membranesâ€”and swells, slowly forcing the cervix further open as it does so, thus eventually causing labor to start. Iâ€™d seen Laminaria used, even in my own time, though in modern times it was most frequently employed to assist in expelling a dead child from the uterus. I shoved that thought well to the back of my mind, and selected a good piece.

It was a simple thing to do, and once done, nothing to do but wait. And hope. The surgery was very peaceful, full of light and the sounds of barn swallows rustling under the eaves.

â€œI hope Ian finds Fergus,â€ Marsali said after a period of silence.

â€œIâ€™m sure he will,â€ I replied, distracted by an attempt to light my small brazier using flint and steel. I should have told Lizzie to have Brianna bring matches. â€œYou said Fergus hadnâ€™t been home?â€

â€œNo.â€ Her voice sounded muffled, and I looked up to see her head bent over Adso, face hidden in his fur. â€œIâ€™ve scarce seen him at all, since . . . since the men came to the malting floor.â€

â€œAh.â€

I didnâ€™t know what to say to this. I hadnâ€™t realized that Fergus had made himself scarceâ€”though knowing what I did of eighteenth-century men, I supposed I could see why.

â€œHeâ€™s ashamed, the wee French gomerel,â€ Marsali said matter-of-factly, confirming my supposition. She turned her face, one blue eye visible above the curve of Adsoâ€™s head. â€œThinks it was his fault, aye? That I was there, I mean. Thinks if he was better able to provide, I shouldna have had to go and tend the malting.â€

â€œMen,â€ I said, shaking my head, and she laughed.

â€œAye, men. Not that heâ€™d say what the trouble is, oâ€™ course. Much better go off and brood about it, and leave me to hame wiâ€™ three wild bairns!â€ She rolled her eyes.

â€œAye, well, they do that, men,â€ said Mrs. Bug tolerantly, coming in with a lighted taper. â€œNo sense at all to them, but they mean weel. I heard ye clickinâ€™ away with that steel like a deathwatch, Mrs. Claire; why would ye no just come and fetch a bit oâ€™ fire like a sensible person?â€ She touched the taper to the kindling in my brazier, which promptly popped into flame.

â€œPractice,â€ I said mildly, adding sticks to the infant flame. â€œI have hopes of eventually learning to light a fire in less than a quarter of an hour.â€

Marsali and Mrs. Bug snorted in simultaneous derision.

â€œBless ye, lamb, a quarter-hourâ€™s no time at all! Why, often Iâ€™ve spent an hour and more, trying to catch a spark in damp tinderâ€”in Scotland, â€™specially, since nothingâ€™s ever dry in the winter there. Whyever dâ€™ye think folk go to such trouble, a-smooring the fire?â€

This caused a spirited discussion of the best way in which to smoor a fire for the night, including an argument over the proper blessing to be said while doing so, and this lasted long enough for me to have coaxed the brazier into a decent glow and set a small kettle in it for tea-making. Raspberry-leaf tea would encourage contractions.

Mention of Scotland seemed to have reminded Marsali of something, for she raised herself on one elbow.

â€œMother Claireâ€”dâ€™ye think Da would mind, if I was to borrow a sheet of paper and some ink? Iâ€™m thinkinâ€™ it would be as well if I wrote to my mother.â€

â€œI think that would be an excellent idea.â€ I went to fetch paper and ink, heart beating a little faster. Marsali was entirely calm; I wasnâ€™t. Iâ€™d seen it before, though; I wasnâ€™t sure whether it was fatalism, religious faith, or something purely physicalâ€”but women giving birth seemed very often to lose any sense of fear or misgiving, turning inward upon themselves and exhibiting an absorption that amounted to indifferenceâ€”simply because they had no attention to spare for anything beyond the universe bounded by their bellies.

As it was, my lingering sense of dread was muted, and two or three hours passed in quiet peace. Marsali wrote to Laoghaire, but also brief notes to each of her children. â€œJust in case,â€ she said laconically, handing the folded notes to me to put away. I noticed that she didnâ€™t write to Fergusâ€”but her eyes darted toward the door every time there was a sound.

Lizzie returned to report that Brianna was nowhere to be found, but Malva Christie turned up, looking excited, and was promptly put to work, reading aloud from Tobias Smollettâ€™s The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle.

Jamie came in, covered with road dust, and kissed me on the lips and Marsali on the forehead. He took in the unorthodox situation, and gave me the ghost of a raised eyebrow.

â€œHow is it, then, a muirninn?â€ he asked Marsali.

She made a small face and put her tongue out, and he laughed.

â€œYou havenâ€™t seen Fergus anywhere, have you?â€ I asked.

â€œAye, I have,â€ he said, looking slightly surprised. â€œDâ€™ye want him?â€ This question was addressed to both Marsali and myself.

â€œWe do,â€ I said firmly. â€œWhere is he?â€

â€œWoolamâ€™s Mill. Heâ€™s been interpreting for a French traveler, an artist come in search of birds.â€

â€œBirds, is it?â€ The notion seemed to affront Mrs. Bug, who put down her knitting and sat up straight. â€œOur Fergus speaks bird-tongue, does he? Well, ye just go and fetch the mannie this minute. Yon Frenchman can mind his own birds!â€

Looking rather taken aback at this vehemence, Jamie allowed me to usher him out into the hallway and as far as the front door. Safely out of earshot, he stopped.

â€œWhatâ€™s to do wiâ€™ the lass?â€ he demanded, low-voiced, and darted a glance back toward the surgery, where Malvaâ€™s clear, high voice had taken up her reading again.

I told him, as well as I could.

â€œIt may be nothing; I hope so. Butâ€”she wants Fergus. She says heâ€™s been keeping away, feeling guilty for what happened at the malting floor.â€

Jamie nodded.

â€œWell, aye, he would.â€

â€œHe would? Why, for heavenâ€™s sake?â€ I demanded in exasperation. â€œIt wasnâ€™t his fault!â€

He gave me a look suggesting that I had missed something patently obvious to the meanest intelligence.

â€œYe think that makes a difference? And if the lass should dieâ€”or mischief come to the child? Ye think heâ€™d not blame himself?â€

â€œHe shouldnâ€™t,â€ I said. â€œBut rather obviously he does. You donâ€™tâ€”â€ I stopped short, because in fact he did. Heâ€™d told me so, very clearly, the night he brought me back.

He saw the memory cross my face, and the hint of a smile, wry and painful, showed in his eyes. He reached out and traced the line of my eyebrow, where a healing gash had split through it.

â€œYe think I dinna feel that?â€ he asked quietly.

I shook my head, not in negation, but in helplessness.

â€œA manâ€™s wife is his to protect,â€ he said simply, and turned away. â€œIâ€™ll go fetch Fergus.â€



THE LAMINARIA HAD BEEN accomplishing its slow, patient work, and Marsali was beginning to have occasional contractions, though we had not really got down to it, yet. The light was beginning to fade when Jamie arrived with Fergusâ€”and Ian, met on the way.

Fergus was unshaven, covered with dust, and plainly hadnâ€™t bathed in days, but Marsaliâ€™s face lighted like the sun when she saw him. I didnâ€™t know what Jamie had told him; he looked grim and worriedâ€”but at sight of Marsali, he went to her like an arrow to its target, gathering her to him with such fervor that Malva dropped her book on the floor, staring in astonishment.

I relaxed a little, for the first time since I had entered Marsaliâ€™s house that morning.

â€œWell,â€ I said, and took a deep breath. â€œPerhaps weâ€™ll have a little food, shall we?â€

I left Fergus and Marsali alone, while the rest of us ate, and returned to the surgery to find them with heads close together, talking quietly. I hated to disturb them, but it was necessary.

On the one hand, the cervix had dilated very appreciably, and there was no sign of abnormal bleeding, which was a tremendous relief. On the other . . . the babyâ€™s heartbeat was skipping again. Almost certainly a cord problem, I thought.

I was very conscious of Marsaliâ€™s eyes, fixed on my face as I listened through my stethoscope, and I exerted every ounce of will in order to let nothing show.

â€œYouâ€™re doing very well,â€ I assured her, smoothing tumbled hair off her forehead and smiling into her eyes. â€œI think perhaps itâ€™s time to help things along a little.â€

There were assorted herbs that could assist labor, but most of them were not things Iâ€™d use, were there any danger of hemorrhage. At this point, though, I was uneasy enough to want to get things moving as quickly as possible. Raspberry-leaf tea might be a help without being so strong as to induce major or abrupt contractions. Ought I add blue cohosh? I wondered.

â€œThe babe needs to come quickly,â€ Marsali told Fergus, with every appearance of calm. Obviously, I hadnâ€™t been as successful in hiding my concern as Iâ€™d thought.

She had her rosary with her, and now wound it round her hand, the cross dangling. â€œHelp me, mon cher.â€

He lifted the hand with the rosary, and kissed it.

â€œOui, cherie.â€ He crossed himself then, and set to work.

Fergus had spent the first ten years of his life in the brothel where heâ€™d been born. Consequently, he knew a great deal more about womenâ€”in some waysâ€”than any other man Iâ€™d ever met. Even so, I was astonished to see him reach for the strings at the neck of Marsaliâ€™s shift, and draw it down, exposing her breasts.

Marsali didnâ€™t seem at all surprised, merely lying back and turning slightly toward him, the hump of her belly nudging him as she did so.

He knelt on a stool beside the bed, and placing a hand tenderly but absently on the bulge, bent his head toward Marsaliâ€™s breast, lips slightly pursed. Then he appeared to notice me gaping at him, and glanced up over her belly.

â€œOh.â€ He smiled at me. â€œYou have notâ€”well, I suppose you would perhaps not have seen this, milady?â€

â€œI canâ€™t say that I have.â€ I was torn between fascination and a feeling that I should avert my eyes. â€œWhat . . . ?â€

â€œWhen the birth pangs are slow to start, suckling the womanâ€™s breasts encourages the womb to move, thus to hasten the child,â€ he explained, and brushed a thumb unconsciously over one dark-brown nipple, so that it rose, round and hard as a spring cherry. â€œIn the brothel, if one of les filles had a difficulty, sometimes another would do such service for her. I have done it for ma douce beforeâ€”when FÃ©licitÃ© came. It helps; you will see.â€

And without more ado, he cupped the breast in both hands and took the nipple into his mouth, sucking gently, but with great concentration, his eyes closed.

Marsali sighed, and her body seemed to relax in the flowing way that a pregnant womanâ€™s does, as though she were suddenly boneless as a stranded jellyfish.

I was more than disconcerted, but I couldnâ€™t leave, in case anything drastic should happen.

I hesitated for a moment, then pulled out a stool and sat down on it, trying to be inconspicuous. In fact, though, neither of them appeared to be at all concerned with my presenceâ€”if they were even aware of me anymore. I did, however, turn away a little, so as not to stare.

I was both astonished and interested by Fergusâ€™s technique. He was entirely right; suckling by an infant does cause the uterus to contract. The midwives I had known at Lâ€™HÃ´pital des Anges in Paris had told me that, too; a newly delivered woman should be handed the child at once to nurse, so that the bleeding would slow. None of them had happened to mention use of the technique as a means of inducing labor, though.

â€œIn the brothel, if one of les filles had a difficulty, sometimes another would do such service for her,â€ heâ€™d said.

His mother had been one of les filles, though he had never known her. I could imagine a Parisian prostitute, dark-haired, likely young, groaning in laborâ€”and a friend kneeling to suckle her tenderly, cupping tender, swollen breasts and whispering encouragement, as the boisterous noises of satisfied customers echoed through the floors and walls.

Had she died, his mother? In childbirth with him or a subsequent child? Throttled by a drunken client, beaten by the madameâ€™s enforcer? Or was it only that she hadnâ€™t wanted him, hadnâ€™t wished to be responsible for a bastard child, and thus she had left him to the pity of the other women, one of the nameless sons of the street, a child of no one?

Marsali shifted on the bed, and I glanced to see that she was all right. She was. She had only moved in order to put her arms about Fergusâ€™s shoulders, bending her head to his. She had left off her cap; her yellow hair was loose, bright against the sleek darkness of his.

â€œFergus . . . I think Iâ€™m maybe going to die,â€ she whispered, her voice barely audible above the wind in the trees.

He released her nipple, but moved his lips delicately over the surface of her breast, murmuring. â€œYou always think you will die, pâ€™tite puce, all women think it.â€

â€œAye, thatâ€™s because a good many of them do, too,â€ she said a little sharply, and opened her eyes. He smiled, eyes still closed, the tip of his tongue flicking gently against her nipple.

â€œNot you,â€ he said softly, but with great assurance. He passed his hand over her stomach, first gently, then with more strength. I could see the mound firm itself, suddenly drawing up round and solid. Marsali drew a deep, sudden breath, and Fergus pressed the heel of his hand against the base of the mound, hard against her pubic bone, holding it there until the contraction relaxed.

â€œOh,â€ she said, sounding breathless.

â€œTu . . . non,â€ he whispered, still more softly. â€œNot you. I will not let you go.â€

I curled my hands in the stuff of my skirt. That looked like a nice, solid contraction. Nothing horrible seemed to be happening as a result.

Fergus resumed his work, pausing now and then to murmur something ridiculous to Marsali in French. I got up and sidled cautiously round toward the foot of the bed table. No, nothing untoward. I cast a quick look at the counter, to be sure all was in readiness, and it was.

Perhaps it would be all right. There was a streak of blood on the sheetâ€”but it was only a bit of bloody show, quite normal. There was still the childâ€™s worrying heartbeat, the possibility of a cord accidentâ€”but I could do nothing about that now. Marsali had made her decision, and it was the right one.

Fergus had resumed his suckling. I stepped quietly out into the hall, and swung the door half-closed, to give them privacy. If she did hemorrhage, I could be with her in a second.

I still had the jar of raspberry leaves in my hand. I supposed I might as well go ahead and make the teaâ€”if only to make myself feel useful!

Not finding his wife at home, old Arch Bug had come up to the house with the children. FÃ©licitÃ© and Joan were sound asleep on the settle, and Arch was smoking his pipe by the hearth, blowing smoke rings for a rapt Germain. Meanwhile Jamie, Ian, and Malva Christie seemed to be engaged in an amiable literary argument regarding the merits of Henry Fielding, Tobias Smollett, and . . .

â€œOvid?â€ I said, catching the tail end of one remark. â€œReally?â€

â€œSo long as you are secure you will count many friends,â€ Jamie quoted. â€œIf your life becomes clouded you will be alone. Dâ€™ye not think thatâ€™s the case for poor Tom Jones and wee Perry Pickle?â€

â€œBut surely true friends wouldnae abandon a man, only because heâ€™s in some difficulty!â€ Malva objected. â€œWhat sort of friend is that?â€

â€œRather the common sort, Iâ€™m afraid,â€ I said. â€œLuckily, there are a few of the other kind.â€

â€œAye, there are,â€ Jamie agreed. He smiled at Malva. â€œHighlanders make the truest friendsâ€”if only because they make the worst enemies.â€

She was slightly pink in the face, but realized that she was being teased.

â€œHmp,â€ she said, and lifted her nose in order to look down it. â€œMy faither says Highlanders are such fierce fighters because thereâ€™s sae little of any value in the Highlands, and the worst battles are always fought for the lowest stakes.â€

Everyone dissolved in laughter at that, and Jamie rose to come to me, leaving Ian and Malva to resume their wrangle.

â€œHow is it wiâ€™ the lass?â€ he asked quietly, dipping up hot water from the kettle for me.

â€œIâ€™m not sure,â€ I said. â€œFergus is . . . er . . . helping her.â€

Jamieâ€™s eyebrows went up.

â€œHow?â€ he asked. â€œI didna ken there was much a man had to do wiâ€™ that business, once heâ€™s got it properly begun.â€

â€œOh, youâ€™d be surprised,â€ I assured him. â€œI certainly was!â€

He looked intrigued by this, but was prevented from asking further questions by Mrs. Bugâ€™s demand that everyone leave off talking about wretched folk who get up to no good in the pages of books, and come sit down to eat.

I sat down to supper, too, but couldnâ€™t really eat, distracted as I was by concern for Marsali. The raspberry-leaf tea had finished steeping as we ate; I poured it out and took it to the surgeryâ€”rapping cautiously on the door before entering.

Fergus was flushed and breathless, but bright-eyed. He could not be persuaded to come and eat, insisting that he would stay with Marsali. His efforts were showing fruit; she was having regular contractions now, though still fairly far apart.

â€œIt will be fast, once the waters break,â€ Marsali told me. She was a little flushed, too, with a look of inward listening. â€œIt always is.â€

I checked the heartbeat againâ€”no great change; still bumpy, but not weakeningâ€”and excused myself. Jamie was in his study, across the hall. I went in and sat with him, so as to be handy when needed.

He was writing his usual evening note to his sister, pausing now and then to rub the cramp from his right hand before resuming. Upstairs, Mrs. Bug was putting the children to bed. I could hear FÃ©licitÃ© whining, and Germain attempting to sing to her.

Across the hall, small shufflings and murmurings, the shifting of weight and the creak of the table. And in the depths of my inner ear, echoing my own pulse, the soft, rapid beat of a babyâ€™s heart.

It could so easily end badly.

â€œWhat are ye doing, Sassenach?â€

I looked up, startled.

â€œIâ€™m not doing anything.â€

â€œYeâ€™re staring fit to see through the wall, and it doesna seem that ye like what yeâ€™re looking at.â€

â€œOh.â€ I dropped my gaze, and realized that I had been pleating and repleating the fabric of my skirt between my fingers; there was a large wrinkled patch in the fawn-colored homespun. â€œReliving my failures, I suppose.â€

He looked at me for a moment, then rose and came behind me, putting his hands on the base of my neck, kneading my shoulders with a strong, warm touch.

â€œWhat failures?â€ he asked.

I closed my eyes and let my head nod forward, trying not to groan with the sensations of pain from knotted muscles and the simultaneous exquisite relief.

â€œOh,â€ I said, and sighed. â€œPatients I couldnâ€™t save. Mistakes. Disasters. Accidents. Stillbirths.â€

That last word hung in the air, and his hands paused in their work for a moment, then resumed more strongly.

â€œThere are times, surely, when thereâ€™s nothing ye could do? You or anyone. Some things are beyond the power of anyone to make right, aye?â€

â€œYou never believe that, when itâ€™s you,â€ I said. â€œWhy should I?â€

He paused in his kneading, and I looked up over my shoulder at him. He opened his mouth to contradict me, then realized that he couldnâ€™t. He shook his head, sighed, and resumed.

â€œAye, well. I suppose itâ€™s true enough,â€ he said, with extreme wryness.

â€œThat what the Greeks called hubris, do you think?â€

He gave a small snort, which might have been amusement.

â€œI do. And ye ken where that leads.â€

â€œTo a lonely rock under a burning sun, with a vulture gnawing on your liver,â€ I said, and laughed.

So did Jamie.

â€œAye, well, a lonely rock under a burning sun is a verra good place to have company, I should think. And I dinna mean the vulture, either.â€

His hands gave a final squeeze to my shoulders, but he didnâ€™t take them away. I leaned my head back against him, eyes closed, taking comfort in his company.

In the momentary silence, we could hear small sounds across the hall, from the surgery. A muffled grunt from Marsali as a contraction came on, a soft French question from Fergus.

I felt that we really ought not to be listeningâ€”but neither of us could think of anything to say, to cover the sounds of their private conversation.

A murmur from Marsali, a pause, then Fergus said something hesitant.

â€œAye, like we did before FÃ©licitÃ©,â€ came Marsaliâ€™s voice, muffled, but quite clear.

â€œOui, butâ€”â€

â€œPut something against the door, then,â€ she said, sounding impatient.

We heard footsteps, and the door to the surgery swung open. Fergus stood there, dark hair disheveled, shirt half-buttoned, and his handsome face deeply flushed under the shadow of beard stubble. He saw us, and the most extraordinary look flitted across his face. Pride, embarrassment, and something indefinably . . . French. He gave Jamie a lopsided smile and a one-shouldered shrug of supreme Gallic insoucianceâ€”then firmly shut the door. We heard the grating sounds of a small table being moved, and a small thump as it was shoved against the door.

Jamie and I exchanged looks of bafflement.

Giggles came from behind the closed door, accompanied by a massive creaking and rustling.

â€œHeâ€™s no going toâ€”â€ Jamie began, and stopped abruptly, looking incredulous. â€œIs he?â€

Evidently so, judging from the faint rhythmic creaks that began to be heard from the surgery.

I felt a slight warmth wash through me, along with a mild sense of shockâ€”and a slightly stronger urge to laugh.

â€œWell . . . er . . . I have heard that . . . um . . . it does sometimes seem to bring on labor. If a child was overdue, the maÃ®tresses sage femme in Paris would sometimes tell women to get their husbands drunk and . . . er-hmm.â€

Jamie gave the surgery door a look of disbelief, mingled with grudging respect.

â€œAnd him with not even a dram taken. Well, if thatâ€™s what heâ€™s up to, the wee buggerâ€™s got balls, Iâ€™ll say that for him.â€

Ian, coming down the hall in time to hear this exchange, stopped dead. He listened for a moment to the noises proceeding from the surgery, looked from Jamie and me to the surgery door, back, then shook his head and turned around, going back to the kitchen.

Jamie reached out and gently closed the study door.

Without comment, he sat down again, picked up his pen, and began scratching doggedly away. I went over to the small bookshelf, and stood there staring at the collection of battered spines, taking nothing in.

Old wivesâ€™ tales were sometimes nothing more than old wivesâ€™ tales. Sometimes they werenâ€™t.

I was seldom troubled by personal recollections while dealing with patients; I had neither time nor attention to spare. At the moment, though, I had much too much of both. And a very vivid memory indeed of the night before Breeâ€™s birth.

People often say that women forget what childbirth is like, because if they remembered, no one would ever do it more than once. Personally, I had no trouble at all remembering.

The sense of massive inertia, particularly. That endless time toward the end, when it seems that it never will end, that one is mired in some prehistoric tar pit, every small move a struggle doomed to futility. Every square centimeter of skin stretched as thin as oneâ€™s temper.

You donâ€™t forget. You simply get to the point where you donâ€™t care what birth will feel like; anything is better than being pregnant for an instant longer.

Iâ€™d reached that point roughly two weeks before my due date. The date cameâ€”and passed. A week later, I was in a state of chronic hysteria, if one could be simultaneously hysterical and torpid.

Frank was physically more comfortable than I was, but in terms of nerves, there wasnâ€™t much to choose between us. Both of us were terrifiedâ€”not merely of the birth, but of what might come after. Frank being Frank, he reacted to terror by becoming very quiet, withdrawing into himself, to a place where he could control what was happening, by refusing to let anything in.

But I was in no mood to respect anyoneâ€™s barriers, and broke down in tears of sheer despair, after being informed by a cheerful obstetrician that I was not dilated at all, and â€œit might be several daysâ€”maybe another week.â€

Trying to calm me, Frank had resorted to rubbing my feet. Then my back, my neck, my shouldersâ€”anything I would let him touch. And gradually, I had exhausted myself and lain quiet, letting him touch me. And . . . and we were both terrified, and terribly in need of reassurance, and neither of us had any words with which to give it.

And he made love to me, slowly and gently, and we fell asleep in each otherâ€™s armsâ€”and woke up in a state of panic several hours later when my water broke.

â€œClaire!â€ I suppose Jamie had called my name more than once; I had been so lost in memory that I had forgotten entirely where I was.

â€œWhat?â€ I swung round, heart pounding. â€œHas something happened?â€

â€œNo, not yet.â€ He studied me for a moment, brow creased, then got up and came to stand by me.

â€œAre ye all right, Sassenach?â€

â€œYes. Iâ€”I was just thinking.â€

â€œAye, I saw that,â€ he said dryly. He hesitated, thenâ€”as a particularly loud moan came through the doorâ€”touched my elbow.

â€œAre ye afraid?â€ he said softly. â€œThat ye might be wiâ€™ child yourself, I mean?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said, and heard the note of desolation in my voice as clearly as he did. â€œI know Iâ€™m not.â€ I looked up at him; his face was blurred by a haze of unshed tears. â€œIâ€™m sad that Iâ€™m notâ€”that I never will be again.â€

I blinked hard, and saw the same emotions on his face that I feltâ€”relief and regret, mingled in such proportion that it was impossible to say which was foremost. He put his arms round me and I rested my forehead on his chest, thinking what comfort it was to know that I had company on this rock, as well.

We stood quietly for some time, just breathing. Then there came a sudden change in the surreptitious noises in the surgery. There was a small cry of surprise, a louder exclamation in French, and then the sound of feet landing heavily on the floor, together with the unmistakable splash of amniotic fluid.



THINGS DID MOVE quickly. Within an hour, I saw the crowning of a black-fuzzed skull.

â€œHeâ€™s got lots of hair,â€ I reported, easing the perineum with oil. â€œBe careful, donâ€™t push too hard! Not yet.â€ I spanned the curve of the emerging skull with my hand. â€œHeâ€™s got a really big head.â€

â€œI wouldna ever have guessed that,â€ said Marsali, red-faced and panting. â€œThank ye for telling me.â€

I barely had time to laugh, before the head eased neatly out into my hands, facedown. The cord was round the neck, but not tightly, thank God! I got a finger under it and eased it free, and didnâ€™t have to say, â€œPush!â€ before Marsali took a breath that went to China and shot the infant into my middle like a cannonball.

It was like being suddenly handed a greased pig, and I fumbled madly, trying to get the little creature turned upright and see whether heâ€”or sheâ€”was breathing.

Meanwhile, there were shrieks of excitement from Malva and Mrs. Bug, and heavy footsteps hastening down the hall from the kitchen.

I found the babyâ€™s face, hastily cleared the nostrils and mouth, blew a short puff of air into the mouth, snapped a finger against the sole of one foot. The foot jerked back in reflex, and the mouth opened wide in a lusty howl.

â€œBon soir, Monsieur Lâ€™Oeuf,â€ I said, checking hastily to be sure that it was indeed Monsieur.

â€œMonsieur?â€ Fergusâ€™s face split in an ears-wide grin.

â€œMonsieur,â€ I confirmed, and hastily wrapping the baby in a flannel, thrust him into his fatherâ€™s arms while I turned my attention to tying and cutting the cord, then tending to his mother.

His mother, thank God, was doing well. Exhausted and sweat-drenched, but likewise grinning. So was everyone else in the room. The floor was puddled, the bedding soaked, and the atmosphere thick with the fecund scents of birth, but no one seemed to notice in the general excitement.

I kneaded Marsaliâ€™s belly to encourage the uterus to contract, while Mrs. Bug brought her an enormous mug of beer to drink.

â€œHeâ€™s all right?â€ she said, emerging after thirstily engulfing this. â€œTruly all right?â€

â€œWell, heâ€™s got two arms, two legs, and a head,â€ I said. â€œI hadnâ€™t time to count the fingers and toes.â€

Fergus laid the baby on the table beside Marsali.

â€œSee for yourself, ma cher,â€ he said. He folded back the blanket. And blinked, then leaned closer, frowning.

Ian and Jamie stopped talking, seeing him.

â€œIs there something amiss, then?â€ Ian asked, coming over.

Sudden silence struck the room. Malva glanced from one face to another, bewildered.

â€œMaman?â€

Germain stood in the doorway, swaying sleepily.

â€œIs he here? Câ€™est Monsieur?â€

Without waiting for answer or permission, he staggered forward and leaned on the bloodstained bedding, mouth a little open as he stared at his newborn brother.

â€œHe looks funny,â€ he said, and frowned a little. â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with him?â€

Fergus had been standing stock-still, as had we all. At this, he looked down at Germain, then glanced back at the baby, then again to his firstborn son.

â€œIl est un nain,â€ he said, almost casually. He squeezed Germainâ€™s shoulder, hard enough to elicit a yelp of startlement from the boy, then turned suddenly on his heel and went out. I heard the opening of the front door, and a cold draft swept down the hall and through the room.

Il est un nain. He is a dwarf.

Fergus hadnâ€™t closed the door, and the wind blew out the candles, leaving us in semidarkness, lit only by the glow of the brazier.

WINTER WOLVES




LITTLE HENRI-CHRISTIAN appeared to be perfectly healthy; he was simply a dwarf. He was slightly jaundiced, though, with a faint gold cast to his skin that gave his round cheeks a delicate glow, like the petals of a daffodil. With a slick of black hair across the top of his head, he might have been a Chinese babyâ€”bar the huge, round blue eyes.

In a way, I supposed I should feel grateful to him. Nothing less than the birth of a dwarf could have deflected the attention of the Ridge from me and the events of the past month. As it was, people no longer stared at my healing face or stumbled awkwardly to find something to say to me. They had quite a lot to sayâ€”to me, to each other, and not infrequently, to Marsali, if neither Bree nor I was in time to stop them.

I supposed they must be saying the same things to Fergusâ€”if they saw him. He had come back, three days following the babyâ€™s birth, silent and dark-faced. He had stayed long enough to assent to Marsaliâ€™s choice of name, and to have a brief, private conversation with her. Then he had left again.

If she knew where he was, she wasnâ€™t saying. For the time being, she and the children remained at the Big House with us. She smiled and paid attention to the other children, as mothers must, though she seemed always to be listening for something that wasnâ€™t there. Fergusâ€™s footsteps? I wondered.

One good thing: she kept Henri-Christian always close to her, carrying him in a sling, or sitting by her feet in his basket of woven rushes. Iâ€™d seen parents who had given birth to children with defects; often, their response was to withdraw, unable to deal with the situation. Marsali dealt with it in the other way, becoming fiercely protective of him.

Visitors came, ostensibly to speak to Jamie about something or to get a bit of a tonic or a salve from meâ€”but really in hopes of catching a glimpse of Henri-Christian. It was no surprise, therefore, that Marsali tensed, clutching Henri-Christian to her bosom, when the back door opened and a shadow fell across the threshold.

She relaxed a little, though, seeing that the visitor was Young Ian.

â€œHello, coz,â€ he said, smiling at her. â€œAre ye well, then, and the bairn, too?â€

â€œVerra well,â€ she said firmly. â€œCome to visit your new cousin, have ye?â€ I could see that she eyed him narrowly.

â€œI have, aye, and brought him a wee present, too.â€ He lifted one big hand, and touched his shirt, which bulged a little with whatever was inside it. â€œYeâ€™re well, too, I hope, Auntie Claire?â€

â€œHallo, Ian,â€ I said, getting to my feet and putting aside the shirt Iâ€™d been hemming. â€œYes, Iâ€™m fine. Do you want some beer?â€ I was grateful to see him; Iâ€™d been keeping Marsali company while she sewedâ€”or rather, standing guard over her to repel the less-welcome sort of visitor, while Mrs. Bug was tending to the chickens. But I had a decoction of stinging-nettle brewing in the surgery, and needed to check on it. Ian could be trusted to take care of her.

Leaving them with refreshment, I escaped to my surgery and spent a pleasant quarter of an hour alone with the herbs, decanting infusions and separating a heap of rosemary to dry, surrounded by pungent scent and the peacefulness of plants. Such solitude was hard to come by these days, with children popping up underfoot like mushrooms. Marsali was anxious to go back to her own home, I knewâ€”but I was loath to let her go without Fergus there to provide some help.

â€œBloody man,â€ I muttered under my breath. â€œSelfish little beast.â€

Evidently, I wasnâ€™t the only one who thought so. As I came back down the hall, reeking of rosemary and ginseng root, I overheard Marsali expressing a similar opinion to Ian.

â€œAye, I ken heâ€™s taken back, who wouldna be?â€ she was saying, her voice full of hurt. â€œBut why must he run awa, and leave us alone? Did ye speak to him, Ian? Did he say anything?â€

So that was it. Ian had been gone on one of his mysterious journeys; he must have encountered Fergus somewhere, and told Marsali about it.

â€œAye,â€ he said, after a momentâ€™s hesitation. â€œJust a bit.â€ I hung back, not wanting to interrupt them, but I could see his face, the ferocity of his tattoos at odds with the sympathy that clouded his eyes. He leaned across the table, holding out his arms. â€œCan I hold him, coz? Please?â€

Marsaliâ€™s back stiffened with surprise, but she handed over the baby, who squirmed and kicked a little in his wrappings, but quickly settled against Ianâ€™s shoulder, making little smacking noises. Ian bent his head, smiling, and brushed his lips across Henri-Christianâ€™s big round head.

He said something soft to the baby, in what I thought was Mohawk.

â€œWhatâ€™s that ye said?â€ Marsali asked, curious.

â€œA sort of blessing, yeâ€™d call it.â€ He patted Henri-Christianâ€™s back, very softly. â€œYe call upon the wind to welcome him, the sky to give him shelter, and the water and the earth to yield him food.â€

â€œOh.â€ Marsaliâ€™s voice was soft. â€œThatâ€™s so nice, Ian.â€ But then she squared her shoulders, unwilling to be distracted. â€œYe spoke wiâ€™ Fergus, ye said.â€

Ian nodded, eyes closed. His cheek rested lightly on the babyâ€™s head. He didnâ€™t speak for a moment, but I saw his throat move, the big Adamâ€™s apple bobbing as he swallowed.

â€œI had a child, cousin,â€ he whispered, so softly that I barely heard him.

Marsali heard him. She froze, the needle she had picked up glinting in her hand. Then, moving very slowly, put it down again.

â€œDid ye, then?â€ she said just as softly. And rising, went round the table in a quiet rustle of skirts to sit beside him on the bench, close enough that he could feel her there, and laid a small hand against his elbow.

He didnâ€™t open his eyes, but drew breath, and with the baby nestled against his heart, began to talk, in a voice hardly louder than the crackle of the fire.



HE WOKE OUT OF SLEEP, knowing that something was deeply wrong. He rolled toward the back of the bed platform, where his weapons lay at hand, but before he could seize knife or spear, he heard again the sound that must have wakened him. It came from behind him; no more than a slight catch of breath, but he heard both pain and fear in it.

The fire burned very low; he saw no more than the dark top of Wakoâ€™teqehsnonhsaâ€™s head, a red glow outlining it, and the double mound of shoulder and hip beneath the furs. She didnâ€™t move or make the sound again, but something in those still dark curves cleft through his heart like a tomahawk striking home.

He gripped her shoulder fiercely, willing her to be all right. Her bones were small and hard through her flesh. He could find no proper words; all the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka had fled out of his head, and so he spoke in the first words that came to him.

â€œLassâ€”loveâ€”are ye all right, then? Blessed Michael defend us, are ye well?â€

She knew he was there, but didnâ€™t turn to him. Somethingâ€”a strange ripple, like a stone thrown in waterâ€”went through her, and the breath caught in her throat again, a small dry sound.

He didnâ€™t wait, but scrambled naked from the furs, calling for help. People came tumbling out into the dim light of the longhouse, bulky shapes hurrying toward him in a fog of questions. He couldnâ€™t speak; didnâ€™t need to. Within moments, Tewaktenyonh was there, her strong old face set in grim calm, and the women of the longhouse rushed past him, pushing him aside as they carried Emily away, wrapped in a deerâ€™s hide.

He followed them outside, but they ignored him, disappearing into the womenâ€™s house at the end of the village. Two or three men came out, looked after them, then shrugged, turned, and went back inside. It was cold, and very late, and plainly womenâ€™s business.

He went inside himself, after a few moments, but only long enough to pull on a few clothes. He couldnâ€™t stay in the longhouse, not with the bed empty of her and smelling of blood. There was blood on his skin as well, but he didnâ€™t pause to wash.

Outside, the stars had faded, but the sky was still black. It was bone-cold, and very still.

The hide that hung over the door of his longhouse moved, and Rollo slipped through, gray as a ghost. The big dog extended his paws and stretched, groaning with the stiffness of the hour and the cold. Then he shook his heavy ruff, snorted out a puff of white breath, and ambled slowly to his masterâ€™s side. He sat down heavily, with a resigned sigh, and leaned against Ianâ€™s leg.

Ian stood a moment longer, looking toward the house where his Emily was. His face was hot, fevered with urgency. He burned harsh and bright, like a coal, but he could feel the heat seeping out of him into the cold sky, and his heart turning slowly black. Finally, he slapped his palm against his thigh and turned away into the forest, walking fast, the dog padding big and soundless by his side.

â€œHail Mary, full of grace . . .â€ He paid no attention to where he was going, praying under his breath, but aloud, for the comfort of his own voice in the silent dark.

Ought he to be praying to one of the Mohawk spirits, he wondered? Would they be angry that he spoke to his old God, to Godâ€™s mother? Might they take revenge for such a slight, on his wife and child?

The child is dead already. He had no notion where that knowledge came from, but he knew it was so, as surely as if someone had spoken the words to him aloud. The knowledge was dispassionate, not yet food for grief; only a fact he knew to be trueâ€”and was appalled to know it.

On he went into the woods, walking, then running, slowing only when he must, to draw breath. The air was knife-cold and still, smelling of rot and turpentine, but the trees whispered just a little as he passed. Emily could hear them talk; she knew their secret voices.

â€œAye, and what good is that?â€ he muttered, face turned up to the starless void between the branches. â€œYe dinna say anything worth knowing. Ye dinna ken how it is with her now, do ye?â€

He could hear the dogâ€™s feet now and then, rustling among the dead leaves just behind him, thudding softly on patches of bare ground. He stumbled now and then, feet lost in the darkness, fell once bruisingly, stumbled to his feet, and ran clumsily on. He had stopped praying; his mind wouldnâ€™t form words any longer, couldnâ€™t choose among the fractured syllables of his different tongues, and his breath burned thick in his throat as he ran.

He felt her body against him in the cold, her full breasts in his hands, her small round buttocks thrusting back, heavy and eager as he rammed her, oh, God, he knew he ought not, he knew! And yet heâ€™d done it, night after night, mad for the slippery tight clutch of her, long past the day when he knew he should stop, selfish, mindless, mad and wicked with lust. . . .

He ran, and her trees murmured condemnation above him as he went.

He had to stop, sobbing for breath. The sky had turned from black to the color that comes before the light. The dog nosed at him, whining softly in his throat, amber eyes gone blank and dark in the no-light of the hour.

Sweat poured down his body under the leather shirt, soaked the draggled breechclout between his legs. His privates were chilled, shriveled against his body, and he could smell himself, a rank, bitter scent of fear and loss.

Rolloâ€™s ears pricked, and the dog whined again, moving a step away, back, away again, tail twitching nervously. Come, he was saying, as clearly as words. Come now!

For himself, Ian could have lain down on the frozen leaves, buried his face in the earth, and stayed. But habit pulled at him; he was accustomed to heed the dog.

â€œWhat?â€ he muttered, dragging a sleeve across his wet face. â€œWhat is it, then?â€

Rollo growled, deep in his throat. He was standing rigid, the hackles slowly rising on his neck. Ian saw it, and some distant tremor of alarm made itself felt through the fog of exhausted despair. His hand went to his belt, found emptiness there, and slapped at it, unbelieving. Christ, he had not so much as a skinning knife!

Rollo growled again, louder. A warning, meant to be heard. Ian turned, looking, but saw only the dark trunks of cedar and pine, the ground beneath them a mass of shadows, the air between them filled with mist.

A French trader who had come to their fire had called such a time, such a light, lâ€™heure du loupâ€”the hour of the wolf. And for good reason: it was a hunting time, when the night grows dim, and the faint breeze that comes before the light begins to rise, carrying the scent of prey.

His hand went to the other side of his belt, where the pouch of taseng should hang: bear grease steeped with mint leaves, to hide a manâ€™s scent while huntingâ€”or hunted. But that side too was empty, and he felt his heart beat quick and hard, as the cold wind dried the sweat from his body.

Rolloâ€™s teeth were bared, the growl a continuous rolling thunder. Ian stooped and seized a fallen pine branch from the ground. It was a good length, though flimsier than he would have liked, and unwieldy, clawed with long twigs.

â€œHome,â€ he whispered to the dog. He had no notion where he was, or where the village lay, but Rollo did. The dog backed slowly, eyes still fixed on the gray shadowsâ€”did they move, those shadows?

He was walking faster now, still backward, feeling the slope of the ground through the soles of his moccasins, sensing Rolloâ€™s presence from the rustle of the dogâ€™s feet, the faint whine that came now and then behind him. There. Yes, a shadow had moved! A gray shape, far away and seen too briefly to recognize, but there all the sameâ€”and recognizable by its presence alone.

If there was one, there were more. They did not hunt alone. They werenâ€™t near yet, though; he turned, beginning almost to run. Not in panic now, despite the fear in the pit of his stomach. A quick, steady lope, the hill-walkerâ€™s gait that his uncle had shown him, that would devour the steep, endless miles of the Scottish mountains, steady effort without exhaustion. He must save strength to fight.

He observed that thought with a wry twist of the mouth, snapping off the brittle pine twigs from his club as he went. A moment ago, he had wanted to die, and perhaps he would again, if Emilyâ€” But not now. If Emily . . . and besides, there was the dog. Rollo wouldnâ€™t leave him; they must defend each other.

There was water near; he heard it gurgling under the wind. But carried on the wind came another sound, a long, unearthly howl that brought the sweat out cold on his face again. Another answered it, to the west. Still far away, but they were hunting now, calling to one another. Her blood was on him.

He turned, seeking the water. It was a small creek, no more than a few feet across. He splashed into it without hesitation, splintering the skin of ice that clung to the banks, feeling the cold bite into his legs and feet as it soaked his leggings and filled his moccasins. He stopped for a split second, pulling off the moccasins, lest they be carried away in the current; Emily had made them for him, of moose hide.

Rollo had crossed the stream in two gigantic bounds, and paused on the opposite bank to shake a freezing spray of water from his coat before going on. He held to the bank, though; Ian stayed in the water, splashing shin-deep, staying as long as might be managed. Wolves hunted by wind as much as by ground scent, but no need to make it easy for them.

He had thrust the wet moccasins down the neck of his shirt, and icy trickles ran down chest and belly, soaking his breechclout. His feet were numb; he couldnâ€™t feel the rounded stones of the streambed, but now and then his foot slid on one, slippery with algae, and he lurched and stumbled to keep his balance.

He could hear the wolves more clearly; that was good, thoughâ€”the wind had changed, was toward him now, carrying their voices. Or was it only that they were closer now?

Closer. Rollo was wild, darting to and fro on the far bank, whining and growling, urging him on with brief yips. A deerâ€™s path came down to the stream on that side; he stumbled out of the water onto it, panting and shaking. It took several tries to get the moccasins on again. The soaked leather was stiff, and his hands and feet refused to work. He had to put down his club and use both hands.

He had just managed the second one when Rollo suddenly charged down the bank, roaring a challenge. He whirled on the frozen mud, catching up his club, in time to see a gray shape, nearly Rolloâ€™s size, on the far side of the water, its pale eyes startlingly near.

He screeched and flung the club in reflex. It sailed across the stream and struck the ground near the wolfâ€™s feet, and the thing vanished as though by magic. He stood stock-still for an instant, staring. He had not imagined it, surely?

No, Rollo was raving, bellowing and teeth bared, flecks of foam flying from his muzzle. There were stones at the streamâ€™s edge; Ian seized one, another, scraped up a handful, another, stubbing his fingers in haste on the rocks and frozen soil, holding up the front of his shirt to make a bag.

The more-distant wolf howled again; the near one answered, so close that the hairs rose up straight on the back of his neck. He heaved a rock in the direction of the call, turned, and ran, the bundle of rocks clutched hard against his belly.

The sky had lightened into dawn. Heart and lungs strained for blood and air, and yet it seemed as though he ran so slowly that he floated over the forest floor, passing like a drifting cloud, unable to go faster. He could see each tree, each separate needle of a spruce he passed, short and thick, soft silver-green in the light.

His breath came hard, his vision blurred and cleared, as tears of effort clouded his eyes, were blinked away, welled back again. A tree branch lashed his face and blinded him, the scent of it sharp in his nose.

â€œRed Cedar, help me!â€ he gasped, the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka coming to his lips as though he had never spoken English or called upon Christ and His mother.

Behind you. It was a small voice, quiet, perhaps no more than the voice of his own instinct, but he whirled at once, stone in hand, and slung it with all his force. Another, and another, and another, as fast as he could fling. There was a crack, a thump, and a yelp, and Rollo slewed and skidded, eager to turn and attack.

â€œCome-come-come!â€ He seized the big dogâ€™s ruff as he ran, dragging him round, forcing him along.

He could hear them now, or thought he could. The wind that comes at dawn rustled through the trees, and they whispered overhead, calling him this way, then that, guiding him as he ran. He saw nothing but color, half-blind with effort, but felt their embrace, cool in his mind; a prickling touch of spruce and fir, the skin of white aspen, smooth as a womanâ€™s, sticky with blood.

Go here, come this way, he thought he heard, and followed the sound of the wind.

A howl came from behind them, followed by short yips, and another of acknowledgment. Close, too close! He flung stones behind him as he ran, not looking, no time to turn and aim.

Then there were no more stones and he dropped the empty flap of shirt, arms pumping as he ran, a harsh panting in his ears that might have been his own breath, or the dogâ€™sâ€”or the sound of the beasts behind him.

How many of them? How far to go? He was beginning to stagger, streaks of black and red shooting through his vision. If the village was not nearby, he had no chance.

He lurched sideways, hit the yielding branch of a tree that bent under his weight, then pushed him upright, setting him roughly back on his feet. He had lost his impetus, though, and his sense of direction.

â€œWhere?â€ he gasped to the trees. â€œWhich way?â€

If there was an answer, he didnâ€™t hear it. There was a roar and a thud behind him, a mad scuffle punctuated with the growls and yelps of dogs fighting.

â€œRollo!â€ He turned and flung himself through a growth of dead vines, to find dog and wolf squirming and biting in a writhing ball of fur and flashing teeth.

He dashed forward, kicking and shouting, punching wildly, glad at last to have something to hit, to be fighting back, even if it was the last fight. Something ripped across his leg, but he felt only the jar of impact as he rammed his knee hard into the wolfâ€™s side. It squealed and rolled away, rounding on him at once.

It leaped, and its paws struck him in the chest. He fell back, struck his head glancingly on something, lost breath for an instant, and came to himself to find his hand braced beneath the slavering jaws, straining to keep them from his throat.

Rollo sprang onto the wolfâ€™s back, and Ian lost his grip, collapsing under the weight of reeking fur and squirming flesh. He flung out a hand, seeking anythingâ€”a weapon, a tool, a grip to pull himself freeâ€”and gripped something hard.

He wrenched it from its bed in the moss and smashed it against the wolfâ€™s head. Fragments of bloody teeth flew through the air and struck his face. He struck again, sobbing, and again.

Rollo was whining, a high keening noiseâ€”no, it was him. He bashed the rock down once more on the battered skull, but the wolf had stopped fighting; it lay across his thighs, legs twitching, eyes glazing as it died. He pushed it off in a frenzy of revulsion. Rolloâ€™s teeth sank into the wolfâ€™s outstretched throat, and ripped it out, in a final spray of blood and warm flesh.

Ian closed his eyes and sat still. It didnâ€™t seem possible to move, or to think.

After a time, it seemed possible to open his eyes, and to breathe, at least. There was a large tree at his back; he had fallen against the trunk when the wolf struck him; it supported him now. Among the twisted roots was a muddy hole, from which he had wrenched the stone.

He was still holding the stone; it felt as though it had grown to his skin; he couldnâ€™t open his hand. When he looked he saw that this was because the stone had shattered; sharp fragments had cut his hand, and the pieces of the stone were glued to his hand by drying blood. Using the fingers of his other hand, he bent back the clenched fingers, and pushed the broken pieces of the stone off his palm. He scraped moss from the tree roots, made a wad of it in his hand, then let the curled fingers close over it again.

A wolf howled, in the middle distance. Rollo, who had lain down by Ian, lifted his head with a soft wuff! The howl came again, and seemed to hold a question, a worried tone.

For the first time, he looked at the body of the wolf. For an instant, he thought it moved, and shook his head to clear his vision. Then he looked again.

It was moving. The distended belly rose gently, subsided. It was full light now, and he could see the tiny nubs of pink nipples, showing through the belly fur. Not a pack. A pair. But a pair no more. The wolf in the distance howled again, and Ian leaned to one side and vomited.

Eats Turtles came upon him a little later, sitting with his back against the red-cedar tree by the dead wolf, Rolloâ€™s bulk pressed close against him. Turtle squatted down, a short distance away, balanced on his heels, and watched.

â€œGood hunting, Wolfâ€™s Brother,â€ he said finally, in greeting. Ian felt the knot between his shoulder blades relax just a little. Turtleâ€™s voice held a quiet tone, but no sorrow. She lived, then.

â€œShe whose hearth I share,â€ he said, careful to avoid speaking her name. To speak it aloud might expose her to evil spirits nearby. â€œShe is well?â€

Turtle closed his eyes and raised both brows and shoulders. She was alive, and not in danger. Still, it was not for a man to say what might happen. Ian didnâ€™t mention the child. Neither did Turtle.

Turtle had brought a gun, a bow, and his knife, of course. He took the knife from his belt and handed it to Ian, matter-of-factly.

â€œYou will want the skins,â€ he said. â€œTo wrap your son, when he shall be born.â€

A shock went through Ian, like the shock of sudden rain on bare skin. Eats Turtles saw his face, and turned his head aside, avoiding his eyes.

â€œThis child was a daughter,â€ Turtle said matter-of-factly. â€œTewaktenyonh told my wife, when she came for a rabbit skin to wrap the body.â€

The muscles in his belly tightened and quivered; he thought that perhaps his own skin would burst, but it didnâ€™t. His throat was dry, and he swallowed once, painfully, then shook the moss away and held out his wounded hand for the knife. He bent slowly to skin the wolf.

Eats Turtles was poking with interest at the bloodstained remnants of the shattered stone, when the howl of a wolf brought him upright, staring.

It echoed through the forest, that howl, and the trees moved above them, murmuring uneasily at the sound of loss and desolation. The knife drew swiftly down the pale fur of the belly, dividing the two rows of pink nipples.

â€œHer husband will be nearby,â€ Wolfâ€™s Brother said, not looking up. â€œGo and kill him.â€



MARSALI STARED at him, scarcely breathing. The sadness in her eyes was still there, but had somehow diminished, overwhelmed with compassion. The anger had left her; she had taken back Henri-Christian, and held the fat bundle of her baby with both arms against her breast, her cheek against the bold round curve of his head.

â€œAh, Ian,â€ she said softly. â€œMo charaid, mo chridhe.â€

He sat looking down at his hands, clasped loosely in his lap, and seemed not to have heard her. Finally, though, he stirred, like a statue waking. Without looking up, he reached into his shirt and drew out a small, rolled bundle, bound with hair twine, and decorated with a wampum bead.

He undid this, and leaning over, spread the cured skin of an unborn wolf over the babyâ€™s shoulders. His big, bony hand smoothed the pale fur, cupping for a moment over Marsaliâ€™s hand where it held the child.

â€œBelieve me, cousin,â€ he said, very softly, â€œyour husband grieves. But he will come back.â€ Then he rose and left, silent as an Indian.

LE MAÃ®TRE DES

CHAMPIGNONS




THE SMALL LIMESTONE CAVE we used for a stable was home at the moment only to a nanny goat with two brand-new kids. All the animals born in the spring were now large enough to be turned out to forage in the wood with their mothers. The goat was still getting room service, though, in the form of kitchen scraps and a little cracked corn.

It had been raining for several days, and the morning broke cloudy and damp, every leaf dripping and the air thick with the scents of resin and soggy leaf mulch. Luckily, the cloudiness kept the birds subdued; the jays and mockingbirds were quick to learn, and kept a beady eye on the comings and goings of people with foodâ€”they dive-bombed me regularly as I made my way up the hill with my basin.

I was on my guard, but even so, a bold jay dropped from a branch in a flash of blue and landed in the basin, startling me. Before I could react, it had seized a fragment of corn muffin and darted off, so quickly that I could scarcely believe Iâ€™d seen it, save for the racing of my heart. Luckily I hadnâ€™t dropped the basin; I heard a triumphant screech from the trees, and hurried to get inside the stable before the jayâ€™s friends should try the same tactic.

I was surprised to find that the Dutch door was unbolted at the top and stood an inch or two ajar. There was no danger of the goats escaping, of course, but foxes and raccoons were more than capable of climbing over the lower door, and so both doors were normally bolted at night. Perhaps Mr. Wemyss had forgotten; it was his job to muck out the used straw and settle the stock for the night.

As soon as I pushed open the door, though, I saw that Mr. Wemyss was not to blame. There was a tremendous rustle of straw at my feet, and something big moved in the darkness.

I uttered a sharp yelp of alarm, and this time did drop the basin, which fell with a clang, scattering food across the floor and rousing the nanny goat, who started blatting her head off.

â€œPardon, milady!â€

Hand to my thumping heart, I stepped out of the doorway, so the light fell on Fergus, crouched on the floor, with straws sticking out of his hair like the Madwoman of Chaillot.

â€œOh, so there you are,â€ I said quite coldly.

He blinked and swallowed, rubbing his hand over a face dark with sprouting whiskers.

â€œIâ€”yes,â€ he said. He seemed to have nothing further to add to this. I stood glaring down at him for a moment, then shook my head and stooped to retrieve the potato peelings and other fragments that had fallen from the basin. He moved as though to help me, but I stopped him with a shooing gesture.

He sat still, watching me, hands around his knees. It was dim inside the stable, and water dripped steadily from the plants growing out of the cliffside above, making a curtain of falling drops across the open door.

The goat had stopped making noise, having recognized me, but was now stretching her neck through the railing of her pen, blueberry-colored tongue extended like an anteaterâ€™s, in an effort to reach an apple core that had rolled near the pen. I picked it up and handed it to her, trying to think where to start, and what to say when I did.

â€œHenri-Christianâ€™s doing well,â€ I said, for lack of anything else. â€œPutting on weight.â€

I let the remark trail off, bending over the rail to pour corn and scraps into the wooden feed trough.

Dead silence. I waited a moment, then turned round, one hand on my hip.

â€œHeâ€™s a very sweet little baby,â€ I said.

I could hear him breathing, but he said nothing. With an audible snort, I went and pushed the bottom half of the door open wide, so that the cloudy light outside streamed in, exposing Fergus. He sat with his face turned stubbornly away. I could smell him at a goodly distance; he reeked of bitter sweat and hunger.

I sighed.

â€œDwarves of this sort have got quite normal intelligence. Iâ€™ve checked him thoroughly, and he has all the usual reflexes and responses that he should have. Thereâ€™s no reason why he canâ€™t be educated, be able to workâ€”at something.â€

â€œSomething,â€ Fergus echoed, the word holding both despair and derision. â€œSomething.â€ At last, he turned his face toward me, and I saw the hollowness of his eyes. â€œWith respect, miladyâ€”you have never seen the life of a dwarf.â€

â€œAnd you have?â€ I asked, not so much in challenge as curiosity.

He closed his eyes against the morning light, nodding.

â€œYes,â€ he whispered, and swallowed. â€œIn Paris.â€

The brothel where he had grown up in Paris was a large one, with a varied clientele, famous for being able to offer something for almost any taste.

â€œThe house itself had les filles, naturellement, and les enfants. They are of course the bread and butter of the establishment. But there are always those who desire . . . the exotic, and will pay. And so now and then the madame would send for those who dealt in such things. La MaÃ®tresse des Scorpionsâ€”avec les flagellantes, tu comprends? Ou Le MaÃ®tre des Champignons.â€

â€œThe Master of Mushrooms?â€ I blurted.

â€œOui. The Dwarf Master.â€

His eyes had sunk into his head, his gaze turned inward and his face haggard. He was seeing in memory sights and people who had been absent from his thoughts for many yearsâ€”and was not enjoying the recollection.

â€œLes chanterelles, we called them,â€ he said softly. â€œThe females. The males, they were les morels.â€ Exotic fungi, valued for the rarity of their twisted shapes, the strange savor of their flesh.

â€œThey were not badly treated, les champignons,â€ he said, abstracted. â€œThey were of value, you see. Le MaÃ®tre would buy such infants from their parentsâ€”there was one born in the brothel, once, and the madame was delighted at her good fortuneâ€”or collect them from the streets.â€

He looked down at his hand, the long, delicate fingers moving restlessly, pleating the cloth of his breeches.

â€œThe streets,â€ he repeated. â€œThose who escaped the brothelsâ€”they were beggars. I knew one of them quite wellâ€”Luc, he was called. We would sometimes assist each otherâ€”â€ The shadow of a smile touched his mouth, and he waved his intact hand in the deft gesture of one picking pockets.

â€œBut he was alone, Luc,â€ he continued matter-of-factly. â€œHe had no protector. I found him one day in the alley, with his throat cut. I told the madame, and she sent the doorkeep out at once to seize the body, and sold it to a doctor in the next arondissement.â€

I didnâ€™t ask what the doctor had wanted with Lucâ€™s body. Iâ€™d seen the broad, dried hands of dwarves, sold for divination and protection. And other parts.

â€œI begin to see why a brothel might seem safe,â€ I said, swallowing heavily. â€œBut still . . .â€

Fergus had been sitting with his head braced on his hand, staring at the straw. At this, he looked up at me.

â€œI have parted my buttocks for money, milady,â€ he said simply. â€œAnd thought nothing of it, save when it hurt. But then I met milord, and found a world beyond the brothel and the streets. That my son might return to such places . . .â€ He stopped abruptly, unable to speak. He closed his eyes again, and shook his head, slowly.

â€œFergus. Fergus, dear. You canâ€™t think that Jamieâ€”that weâ€”would ever let such a thing happen,â€ I said, distressed beyond measure.

He drew a deep, trembling breath, and thumbed away the tears that hung on his lashes. He opened his eyes and gave me a smile of infinite sadness.

â€œNo, you would not, milady. But you will not live forever, nor will milord. Nor I. But the child will be a dwarf forever. And les petits, they cannot well defend themselves. They will be plucked up by those who seek them, taken and consumed.â€ He wiped his nose on his sleeve and sat up a little.

â€œIf, that is, they should be so fortunate,â€ he added, his voice hardening. â€œThey are not valued, outside the cities. Peasants, they believe the birth of such a child is at best a judgment on the sins of his parents.â€ A deeper shadow crossed his face, his lips drawing tight. â€œIt may be so. My sinsâ€”â€ But he broke off abruptly, turning away.

â€œAt worstâ€”â€ His voice was soft, head turned away, as though he whispered secrets to the shadows of the cave. â€œAt worst, they are seen as monstrous, children born of some demon who has lain with the woman. People stone them, burn themâ€”sometimes the woman, too. In the mountain villages of France, a dwarf child would be left for the wolves. But do you not know these things, milady?â€ he asked, suddenly turning back to face me.

â€œIâ€”I suppose so,â€ I said, and put out a hand to the wall, suddenly feeling the need of some support. I had known such things, in the abstract way one thinks of the customs of aborigines and savagesâ€”people whom one will never meet, safely distant in the pages of geography books, of ancient histories.

He was right; I knew it. Mrs. Bug had crossed herself, seeing the child, and then made the sign of the horns as protection from evil, pale horror on her face.

Shocked as we had all been, and then concerned with Marsali, and with Fergusâ€™s absence, I hadnâ€™t been away from the house for a week or more. I had no idea what people might be saying, on the Ridge. Fergus plainly did.

â€œTheyâ€™ll . . . get used to him,â€ I said as bravely as I could. â€œPeople will see that he isnâ€™t a monster. It may take some time, but I promise you, theyâ€™ll see.â€

â€œWill they? And if they let him live, what then will he do?â€ He rose to his feet quite suddenly. He stretched out his left arm, and with a jerk, freed the leather strip that held his hook. It fell with a soft thump into the straw, and left the narrow stump of his wrist bare, the pale skin creased with red from the tightness of the wrappings.

â€œMe, I cannot hunt, cannot do a proper manâ€™s work. I am fit for nothing but to pull the plow, like a mule!â€ His voice shook with anger and self-loathing. â€œIf I cannot work as a man does, how shall a dwarf?â€

â€œFergus, it isnâ€™tâ€”â€

â€œI cannot keep my family! My wife must labor day and night to feed the children, must put herself in the way of scum and filth who misuse her, whoâ€” Even if I was in Paris, I am too old and crippled to whore!â€ He shook the stump at me, face convulsed, then whirled and swung his maimed arm, smashing it against the wall, over and over.

â€œFergus!â€ I seized his other arm, but he jerked away.

â€œWhat work will he do?â€ he cried, tears streaming down his face. â€œHow shall he live? Mon Dieu! Il est aussi inutile que moi!â€

He bent and seized the hook from the ground, and hurled it as hard as he could at the limestone wall. It made a small chiming sound as it struck, and fell into the straw, startling the nanny and her kids.

Fergus was gone, the Dutch door left swinging. The goat called after him, a long maaaah! of disapproval.

I held on to the railing of the pen, feeling as though it was the only solid thing in a slowly tilting world. When I could, I bent and felt carefully in the straw until I touched the metal of the hook, still warm from Fergusâ€™s body. I drew it out and wiped bits of straw and manure carefully off it with my apron, still hearing Fergusâ€™s last words.

â€œMy God! He is as useless as I am!â€

A DEâ€™IL IN THE MILK




HENRI-CHRISTIANâ€™S EYES nearly crossed with the effort of focusing on the yarn bobble Brianna dangled over his face.

â€œI think his eyes might stay blue,â€ she said, peering thoughtfully at him. â€œWhat do you think heâ€™s looking at?â€ He lay in her lap, knees drawn up nearly to his chin, the soft blue eyes in question fixed somewhere far beyond her.

â€œOh, the wee ones still see heaven, my Mam said.â€ Marsali was spinning, trying out Briannaâ€™s new treadle wheel, but spared a quick glance at her newest son, smiling a little. â€œMaybe thereâ€™s an angel sitting on your shoulder, aye? Or a saint who stands behind ye.â€

That gave her an odd feeling, as though someone did stand behind her. Not creepy, thoughâ€”more a mild, warm sense of reassurance. She opened her mouth to say, â€œMaybe itâ€™s my father,â€ but caught herself in time.

â€œWhoâ€™s the patron saint of laundry?â€ she said instead. â€œThatâ€™s who we need.â€ It was raining; it had been raining for days, and small mounds of clothing lay scattered about the room or draped over the furniture: damp things in various states of drying, filthy things destined for the wash cauldron as soon as the weather broke, less-filthy things that might be brushed, shaken, or beaten into another few daysâ€™ wearing, and an ever-growing pile of things needing mending.

Marsali laughed, deftly feeding thread to the bobbin.

â€œYeâ€™d have to ask Da about that. He kens more saints than anybody. This is wonderful, this wheel! Iâ€™ve not seen this kind before. However did ye come to think of such a thing?â€

â€œOhâ€”saw one somewhere.â€ Bree flicked a hand, dismissing it. She hadâ€”in a folk-art museum. Building it had been time-consumingâ€”sheâ€™d first had to make a crude lathe, as well as soak and bend the wood for the wheel itselfâ€”but not terribly difficult. â€œRonnie Sinclair helped a lot; he knows what wood will do and what it wonâ€™t. I canâ€™t believe how good you are at that, and this your first time using one like it.â€

Marsali snorted, likewise dismissing the compliment.

â€œIâ€™ve spun since I was five, a piuthar. All thatâ€™s different here is I can sit while I do it, instead of walking to and fro â€™til I fall over wiâ€™ tiredness.â€

Her stockinged feet flickered back and forth under the hem of her dress, working the treadle. It made a pleasant whish-whir soundâ€”though this was barely audible over the babble at the other side of the room, where Roger was carving yet another car for the children.

Vrooms were a big hit with the small-fry, and the demand for them unceasing. Brianna watched with amusement as Roger fended off Jemâ€™s inquisitiveness with a deft elbow, frowning in concentration. The tip of his tongue showed between his teeth, and wood shavings littered the hearth and his clothes, andâ€”of courseâ€”one was stuck in his hair, a pale curl against its darkness.

â€œWhatâ€™s that one?â€ she asked, raising her voice to reach him. He looked up, his eyes a mossy green in the dim rainlight from the window behind him.

â€œI think itâ€™s a â€™57 Chevrolet pickup truck,â€ he said, grinning. â€œHere, then, a nighean. This oneâ€™s yours.â€ He brushed a last shaving from his creation and handed the blocky thing to FÃ©licitÃ©, whose mouth and eyes were round with awe.

â€œIssa vroom?â€ she said, clutching it to her bosom. â€œMy vroom?â€

â€œItâ€™s a druck,â€ Jemmy informed her with kindly condescension. â€œDaddy says.â€

â€œA truck is a vroom,â€ Roger assured FÃ©licitÃ©, seeing doubt begin to pucker her forehead. â€œItâ€™s just a bigger kind.â€

â€œIssa big vroom, see!â€ FÃ©licitÃ© kicked Jem in the shin. He yelped and grabbed for her hair, only to be butted in the stomach by Joan, always there to defend her sister.

Brianna tensed, ready to intervene, but Roger broke up the incipient riot by holding Jem and FÃ©licitÃ© each at armâ€™s length, glaring Joan into retreat.

â€œRight, you lot. No fighting, or we put the vrooms away â€™til tomorrow.â€

That quelled them instantly, and Brianna felt Marsali relax, resuming the rhythm of her spinning. The rain hummed on the roof, solid and steady; it was a good day to be inside, despite the difficulty of entertaining bored children.

â€œWhy donâ€™t you play something nice and quiet?â€ she said, grinning at Roger. â€œLike . . . oh . . . Indianapolis 500?â€

â€œOh, youâ€™re a great help,â€ he said, giving her a dirty look, but he obligingly set the children to work laying out a racetrack in chalk on the big hearthstone.

â€œToo bad Germainâ€™s not here,â€ he said casually. â€œWhereâ€™s he gone in the rain and all, Marsali?â€ Germainâ€™s vroomâ€”according to Roger, it was a Jaguar X-KE, though so far as Brianna could tell, it looked exactly like the others: a block of wood with a rudimentary cab and wheelsâ€”was sitting on the mantelpiece, awaiting its masterâ€™s return.

â€œHeâ€™s with Fergus,â€ Marsali answered calmly, not faltering in her rhythm. Her lips pressed together, though, and it was easy to hear the note of strain in her voice.

â€œAnd howâ€™s Fergus, then?â€ Roger looked up at her, kindly, but intent.

The thread skipped, bounced in Marsaliâ€™s hand, and wound itself up with a visible slub in it. She grimaced, and didnâ€™t reply until the thread was running once more smoothly through her fingers.

â€œWell, I will say, for a man wiâ€™ one hand, heâ€™s a bonny wee fighter,â€ she said at last, eyes on the thread and a wry note in her voice.

Brianna glanced at Roger, who raised an eyebrow back at her.

â€œWhoâ€™s he been fighting?â€ she asked, trying to sound casual.

â€œHe doesna often tell me,â€ Marsali said evenly. â€œThough yesterday it was the husband of a woman who asked him why he didna just strangle Henri-Christian at birth. He took offense,â€ she added, offhand, leaving it unclear as to whether it was Fergus, the husband, or both who had taken offense. Lifting the thread, she bit it sharply off.

â€œI should think so,â€ Roger murmured. His head was bent, marking off the starting line, so his hair fell over his forehead, obscuring his face. â€œNot the only one, though, I take it.â€

â€œNo.â€ Marsali began winding the thread onto the niddy-noddy, a small, seemingly permanent frown showing between her fair brows. â€œI suppose itâ€™s better than the ones who point and whisper. Those are the ones who think Henri-Christianâ€™s theâ€”the devilâ€™s seed,â€ she finished bravely, though her voice quivered a little. â€œI think theyâ€™d burn the wee manâ€”and me and the other weans along with him, if they thought they could.â€

Brianna felt the bottom of her stomach drop, and cuddled the object of discussion in her lap.

â€œWhat sort of idiots could possibly think such a thing?â€ she demanded. â€œLet alone say it out loud!â€

â€œLet alone do it, ye mean.â€ Marsali put aside the yarn and rose, leaning over to take Henri-Christian and put him to her breast. With his knees still curled up, his body was scarcely half the size of a normal babyâ€™sâ€”and with his large, round head with its sprout of dark hair, Brianna had to admit that he did look . . . odd.

â€œDa had a word here and there,â€ Marsali said. Her eyes were closed, and she was rocking slowly back and forth, cradling Henri-Christian close. â€œIf it werenâ€™t for that . . .â€ Her slender throat moved as she swallowed.

â€œDaddy, Daddy, letâ€™s go!â€ Jem, impatient with incomprehensible adult conversation, plucked at Rogerâ€™s sleeve.

Roger had been looking at Marsali, his lean face troubled. At this reminder, he blinked and glanced down at his thoroughly normal son, clearing his throat.

â€œAye,â€ he said, and took down Germainâ€™s car. â€œWell, then, look. Hereâ€™s the starting line. . . .â€

Brianna laid a hand on Marsaliâ€™s arm. It was thin, but strongly muscled, the fair skin gold from sun, spattered with tiny freckles. The sight of it, so small and brave-looking, clutched at her throat.

â€œTheyâ€™ll stop,â€ she whispered. â€œTheyâ€™ll see. . . .â€

â€œAye, maybe.â€ Marsali cupped Henri-Christianâ€™s small round bottom, holding him closer. Her eyes were still closed. â€œMaybe not. But if Germainâ€™s wiâ€™ Fergus, heâ€™ll maybe be more careful who he fights. Iâ€™d rather they didna kill him, aye?â€

She bowed her head over the baby, settling into the nursing and plainly disinclined to talk any further. Brianna patted her arm, a little awkwardly, then moved to take the seat by the spinning wheel.

Sheâ€™d heard the talk, of course. Or some of it. Particularly right after Henri-Christianâ€™s birth, which had sent shock waves through the Ridge. Beyond the first overt expressions of sympathy, there had been a lot of muttering, about recent events and what malign influence might have caused themâ€”from the assault on Marsali and the burning of the malting shed, to the kidnapping of her mother, the slaughter in the woods, and the birth of a dwarf. Sheâ€™d heard one injudicious girl murmur within her hearing something about â€œ. . . witchcraft, what would ye expect?â€â€”but had rounded fiercely to glare at the girl, who had paled and slunk off with her two friends. The girl had glanced back once, though, then turned away, the three of them spitefully sniggering.

But no one had ever treated her or her mother with any lack of respect. It was clear that a number of the tenants were rather afraid of Claireâ€”but they were much more afraid of her father. Time and habituation had seemed to be working, thoughâ€”until the birth of Henri-Christian.

Working the treadle was soothing; the whir of the spinning wheel faded into the sound of the rain and the bickering of the children.

At least Fergus had come back. When Henri-Christian was born, he had left the house and not come back for several days. Poor Marsali, she thought, with a mental scowl at Fergus. Left alone to deal with the shock. And everyone had been shocked, her included. Perhaps she couldnâ€™t really blame Fergus.

She swallowed, imagining, as she did whenever she saw Henri-Christian, what it would be like to have a child born with some terrible defect. She saw them now and thenâ€”children with cleft lips, the misshapen features of what her mother said was congenital syphilis, retarded childrenâ€”and every time, crossed herself and thanked God that Jemmy was normal.

But then, so were Germain and his sisters. Something like this could come out of the blue, at any time. Despite herself, she glanced at the small shelf where she kept her personal things, and the dark brown jar of dauco seeds. Sheâ€™d been taking them again, ever since Henri-Christianâ€™s birth, though she hadnâ€™t mentioned it to Roger. She wondered whether he knew; he hadnâ€™t said anything.

Marsali was singing softly under her breath. Did Marsali blame Fergus? she wondered. Or he her? She hadnâ€™t seen Fergus to talk to in some time. Marsali didnâ€™t seem critical of himâ€”and she had said she didnâ€™t want him killed. Brianna smiled involuntarily at the memory. Yet there was an undeniable sense of distance when she mentioned him.

The thread thickened suddenly, and she trod faster, trying to compensate, only to have it catch and snap. Muttering to herself, she stopped and let the wheel run itself downâ€”only then realizing that someone had been pounding on the door of the cabin for some time, the sound of it lost in the racket inside.

She opened the door to find one of the fisher-folksâ€™ children dripping on the stoop, small, bony, and feral as a wild cat. There were several of them among the tenant families, so alike that she had trouble telling them apart.

â€œAidan?â€ she guessed. â€œAidan McCallum?â€

â€œGood day, mistress,â€ the little boy said, bobbing his head in nervous acknowledgment of identity. â€œIs meenister to hame?â€

â€œMeeâ€”oh. Yes, I suppose so. Come in, wonâ€™t you?â€ Suppressing a smile, she swung the door wide, beckoning him in. The boy looked quite shocked to see Roger, crouched on the floor, playing Vroom with Jemmy and Joan and FÃ©licitÃ©, all industriously screeching and roaring to such effect that they hadnâ€™t noticed the newcomer.

â€œYou have a visitor,â€ she said, raising her voice to interrupt the bedlam. â€œHe wants the minister.â€ Roger broke off in mid-vroom, glancing up in inquiry.

â€œThe what?â€ he said, sitting up, cross-legged, his own car in hand. Then he spotted the boy, and smiled. â€œOh. Aidan, a charaid! What is it, then?â€

Aidan screwed up his face in concentration. Obviously, he had been given a specific message, committed to memory.

â€œMither says will ye come, please,â€ he recited, â€œfor to drive out a deâ€™il whatâ€™s got intae the milk.â€



THE RAIN WAS FALLING more lightly now, but they were still soaked nearly through by the time they reached the McCallum residence. If it could be dignified by such a term, Roger thought, slapping rain from his hat as he followed Aidan up the narrow, slippery path to the cabin, which was perched in a high and inconvenient notch in the side of the mountain.

Orem McCallum had managed to erect the walls of his shakily built cabin, and then had missed his footing and plunged into a rock-strewn ravine, breaking his neck within a month of arrival on the Ridge, and leaving his pregnant wife and young son to its dubious shelter.

The other men had come and hastily put a roof on, but the cabin as a whole reminded Roger of nothing so much as a pile of giant jackstraws, poised precariously on the side of the mountain and obviously only awaiting the next spring flood to slide down the mountain after its builder.

Mrs. McCallum was young and pale, and so thin that her dress flapped round her like an empty flour sack. Christ, he thought, what did they have to eat?

â€œOh, sir, I do thank ye for coming.â€ She bobbed an anxious curtsy to him. â€œIâ€™m that sorry to bring ye out in the rain and allâ€”but I just didna ken what else I might do!â€

â€œNot a problem,â€ he assured her. â€œEr . . . Aidan said, though, that ye wanted a minister. Iâ€™m not that, ye know.â€

She looked disconcerted at that.

â€œOh. Well, maybe not exactly, sir. But they do say as how your faither was a minister, and that ye do ken a great deal about the Bible and all.â€

â€œSome, yes,â€ he replied guardedly, wondering what sort of emergency might require Bible knowledge. â€œA . . . um . . . devil in your milk, was it?â€

He glanced discreetly from the baby in its cradle to the front of her dress, unsure at first whether she might mean her own breast milk, which would be a problem he was definitely not equipped to deal with. Fortunately, the difficulty seemed to lie with a large wooden pail sitting on the ramshackle table, a muslin cloth draped across it to keep flies out, small stones knotted into the corners as weights.

â€œAye, sir.â€ Mrs. McCallum nodded at it, obviously afraid to go nearer. â€œLizzie Wemyss, her from the Big House, she brought that to me last night. She said Herself said as I must give it to Aidan, and drink of it myself.â€ She looked helplessly at Roger. He understood her reservations; even in his own time, milk was regarded as a beverage only for infants and invalids; coming from a fishing village on the Scottish coast, she had quite possibly never seen a cow before coming to America. He was sure she knew what milk was, and that it technically was edible, but she had likely never tasted any.

â€œAye, thatâ€™s quite all right,â€ he assured her. â€œMy family all drink milk; it makes the weans grow tall and strong.â€ And wouldnâ€™t come amiss to a nursing mother on lean rations, which was undoubtedly what Claire had thought.

She nodded, uncertain.

â€œWell . . . aye, sir. I wasna quite sure . . . but the lad was hungry, and said heâ€™d drink it. So I went to dip him out a bit, but itâ€”â€ She glanced at the bucket with an expression of fearful suspicion. â€œWeel, if itâ€™s no a deâ€™ilâ€™s got into it, itâ€™s something else. Itâ€™s haunted, sir, Iâ€™m sure of it!â€

He didnâ€™t know what made him look at Aidan at that moment, but he surprised a fleeting look of deep interest that vanished immediately, leaving the boy with a preternaturally solemn expression.

So it was with a certain sense of forewarning that he leaned forward and gingerly lifted the cloth. Even so, he let out a yelp and jerked back, the weighted cloth flying sideways to clack against the wall.

The malevolent green eyes that glared at him from the middle of the bucket disappeared and the milk went gollup!, a spray of creamy drops erupting from the bucket like a miniature volcano.

â€œShit!â€ he said. Mrs. McCallum had backed away as far as she could get and was staring at the bucket in terror, both hands clapped across her mouth. Aidan had one hand pressed over his own mouth, and was similarly wide-eyedâ€”but a faint fizzing sound was audible from his direction.

Rogerâ€™s heart was pounding from adrenalineâ€”and a strong desire to wring Aidan McCallumâ€™s scrawny neck. He wiped the splattered cream deliberately from his face, then, gritting his teeth, reached gingerly into the bucket of milk.

It took several tries to grab the thing, which felt like nothing so much as a very muscular and animated glob of mucus, but the fourth try succeeded, and he triumphantly pulled a very large and indignant bullfrog out of the bucket, showering milk in every direction.

The frog dug its back legs ferociously into his slippery palm and broke his grip, launching itself in a soaring leap that covered half the distance to the door and made Mrs. McCallum scream out loud. The startled baby woke and added to the uproar, while the cream-covered frog plopped its way rapidly out of the door and into the rain, leaving yellow splotches in its wake.

Aidan prudently followed it out at a high rate of speed.

Mrs. McCallum had sat down on the floor, thrown her apron over her head, and was having hysterics under it. The baby was shrieking, and milk dripped slowly from the edge of the table, punctuating the patter of rain outside. The roof was leaking, he saw; long wet streaks darkened the unbarked logs behind Mrs. McCallum, and she was sitting in a puddle.

With a deep sigh, he plucked the baby out of its cradle, surprising it sufficiently that it gulped and quit screaming. It blinked at him, and stuck its fist in its mouth. He had no idea of its sex; it was an anonymous bundle of rags, with a pinched wee face and a wary look.

Holding it in one arm, he crouched and put the other round Mrs. McCallumâ€™s shoulders, patting her gingerly in hopes of getting her to stop.

â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ he said. â€œIt was just a frog, ye know.â€

Sheâ€™d been moaning like a banshee and uttering small intermittent screams, and she kept doing that, though the screams became less frequent, and the moaning disintegrated at last into more or less normal crying, though she refused to come out from under the apron.

His thigh muscles were cramped from squatting, and he was wet, anyway. With a sigh, he lowered himself into the puddle beside her and sat, patting her shoulder every now and then so sheâ€™d know he was still there.

The baby seemed happy enough, at least; it was sucking its fist, undisturbed by its motherâ€™s fit.

â€œHow oldâ€™s the wean?â€ he said conversationally, during a brief pause for breath. He knew its age approximately, because it had been born a week after Orem McCallumâ€™s deathâ€”but it was something to say. And for as old as it was, it seemed terribly small and light, at least by contrast to his memories of Jemmy at that age.

She mumbled something inaudible, but the crying eased off into hiccups and sighs. Then she said something else.

â€œWhatâ€™s that, Mrs. McCallum?â€

â€œWhy?â€ she whispered from under the faded calico. â€œWhy has God brought me here?â€

Well, that was a bloody good question; heâ€™d asked that one fairly often himself, but hadnâ€™t got back any really good answers yet.

â€œWell . . . we trust Heâ€™s got a plan of some sort,â€ he said a little awkwardly. â€œWe just donâ€™t know what it is.â€

â€œA fine plan,â€ she said, and sobbed once. â€œTo bring us all this way, to this terrible place, and then take my man from me and leave me here to starve!â€

â€œOh . . . itâ€™s no such a terrible place,â€ he said, unable to refute anything else in her statement. â€œThe woods and all . . . the streams, the mountains . . . itâ€™s . . . um . . . very pretty. When itâ€™s not raining.â€ The inanity of this actually made her laugh, though it quickly devolved into more weeping.

â€œWhat?â€ He put an arm round her and pulled her a little closer, both to offer comfort, and in order to make out what she was saying, under her makeshift refuge.

â€œI miss the sea,â€ she said very softly, and leaned her calico-swathed head against his shoulder, as though she was very tired. â€œI never shall see it again.â€

She was very likely right, and he could find nothing to say in reply. They sat for some time in a silence broken only by the babyâ€™s slobbering over its fist.

â€œI wonâ€™t let ye starve,â€ he said at last, softly. â€œThatâ€™s all I can promise, but I do. Ye wonâ€™t starve.â€ Muscles cramped, he got stiffly to his feet, and reached down to one of the small rough hands that lay limply in her lap. â€œCome on, then. Get up. Ye can feed the wean, while I tidy up a bit.â€



THE RAIN HAD CEASED by the time he left, and the clouds had begun to drift apart, leaving patches of pale blue sky. He paused at a turn in the steep, muddy path to admire a rainbowâ€”a complete one, that arched from one side of the sky to the other, its misty colors sinking down into the dark wet green of the dripping mountainside across from him.

It was quiet, save for the splat and drip of water from the leaves and the gurgle of water running down a rocky channel near the trail.

â€œA covenant,â€ he said softly, out loud. â€œWhatâ€™s the promise, then? Not a pot of gold at the end.â€ He shook his head and went on, grabbing at branches and bushes to keep from sliding down the mountainside; he didnâ€™t want to end up like Orem McCallum, in a tangle of bones at the bottom.

Heâ€™d talk to Jamie, and also to Tom Christie and Hiram Crombie. Among them, they could put out the word, and ensure the widow McCallum and her children got enough food. Folk were generous to shareâ€”but someone had to ask.

He glanced back over his shoulder; the crooked chimney was just visible above the trees, but no smoke came from it. They could gather enough firewood, she saidâ€”but wet as it was, it would be days before they had anything that would burn. They needed a shed for the wood, and logs cut, big enough to burn for a day, not the twigs and fallen branches Aidan could carry.

As though the thought had summoned him, Aidan came into view then. The boy was fishing, squatting on a rock beside a pool some thirty feet below, back turned to the trail. His shoulder blades stuck out through the worn fabric of his shirt, distinct as tiny angel wings.

The noise of the water covered Rogerâ€™s footsteps as he made his way down the rocks. Very gently, he fitted his hand around the skinny, pale neck, and the bony shoulders hunched in surprise.

â€œAidan,â€ he said. â€œA word wiâ€™ you, if ye please.â€



THE DARK CAME DOWN on All Hallowsâ€™ Eve. We went to sleep to the sound of howling wind and pelting rain, and woke on the Feast of All Saints to whiteness and large soft flakes falling down and down in absolute silence. There is no more perfect stillness than the solitude in the heart of a snowstorm.

This is the thin time, when the beloved dead draw near. The world turns inward, and the chilling air grows thick with dreams and mystery. The sky goes from a sharp clear cold where a million stars burn bright and close, to the gray-pink cloud that enfolds the earth with the promise of snow.

I took one of Breeâ€™s matches from its box and lit it, thrilling to the tiny leap of instant flame, and bent to put it to the kindling. Snow was falling, and winter had come; the season of fire. Candles and hearth fire, that lovely, leaping paradox, that destruction contained but never tamed, held at a safe distance to warm and enchant, but always, still, with that small sense of danger.

The smell of roasting pumpkins was thick and sweet in the air. Having ruled the night with fire, the jack-oâ€™-lanterns went now to a more peaceful fate as pies and compost, to join the gentle rest of the earth before renewal. I had turned the earth in my garden the day before, planting the winter seeds to sleep and swell, to dream their buried birth.

Now is the time when we reenter the womb of the world, dreaming the dreams of snow and silence. Waking to the shock of frozen lakes under waning moonlight and the cold sun burning low and blue in the branches of the ice-cased trees, returning from our brief and necessary labors to food and story, to the warmth of firelight in the dark.

Around a fire, in the dark, all truths can be told, and heard, in safety.

I pulled on my woolen stockings, thick petticoats, my warmest shawl, and went down to poke up the kitchen fire. I stood watching wisps of steam rise from the fragrant cauldron, and felt myself turn inward. The world could go away, and we would heal.

I AM THE RESURRECTION




November 1773

A HAMMERING ON THE DOOR roused Roger just before dawn. Next to him, Brianna made an inarticulate noise that experience interpreted as a statement that if he didnâ€™t get up and answer the door, she wouldâ€”but heâ€™d regret it, and so would the unfortunate person on the other side.

Resigned, he flung back the quilt and ran a hand through his tangled hair. The air struck cold on his bare legs, and there was an icy breath of snow in the air.

â€œNext time I marry someone, Iâ€™ll pick a lass who wakes up cheerful in the morning,â€ he said to the hunched form beneath the bedclothes.

â€œYou do that,â€ said a muffled voice from under the pillowâ€”whose indistinct nature did nothing to disguise its hostile intonation.

The hammering was repeated, and Jemmyâ€”who did wake up cheerful in the morningsâ€”popped up in his trundle, looking like a redheaded dandelion gone to seed.

â€œSomebodyâ€™s knocking,â€ he informed Roger.

â€œOh, are they? Mmphm.â€ Repressing an urge to groan, he rose and went to unbolt the door.

Hiram Crombie stood outside, looking more dour than usual in the milky half-light. Evidently not a happy riser, either, Roger reflected.

â€œMy wifeâ€™s auld mitherâ€™s passed iâ€™ the night,â€ he informed Roger without preamble.

â€œPassed what?â€ asked Jemmy with interest, poking his disheveled head out from behind Rogerâ€™s leg. He rubbed one eye with a fist, and yawned widely. â€œMr. Stornaway passed a stoneâ€”he showed it to me and Germain.â€

â€œMr. Crombieâ€™s mother-in-law has died,â€ Roger said, putting a quelling hand on Jemâ€™s head, with an apologetic cough toward Crombie. â€œIâ€™m sorry to hear that, Mr. Crombie.â€

â€œAye.â€ Mr. Crombie appeared indifferent to condolence. â€œMurdo Lindsay says as ye ken a bit of Scripture for the burying. The wifeâ€™s wonderinâ€™ would ye maybe come and say a word at the grave?â€

â€œMurdo said . . . oh!â€ The Dutch family, that was it. Jamie had forced him to speak at the graves. â€œAye, of course.â€ He cleared his throat by reflex; his voice was desperately hoarseâ€”as usual in the mornings, until heâ€™d had a cup of something hot. No wonder Crombie was looking dubious.

â€œOf course,â€ he repeated more strongly. â€œIs there . . . er . . . anything we can do to help?â€

Crombie made a small negative gesture.

â€œThe women will have her laid out by now, I expect,â€ he said, with the briefest of glances at the mound Brianna made in the bed. â€œWeâ€™ll start the digginâ€™ after breakfast. With luck, weâ€™ll have her under before snow falls.â€ He lifted a sharp chin toward an opaque sky the soft gray of Adsoâ€™s belly fur, then nodded, turned on his heel, and left without further congenialities.

â€œDaddyâ€”look!â€ Roger looked down to see Jem, fingers hooked in the corners of his mouth, pulled down to simulate the inverted â€œUâ€ of Hiram Crombieâ€™s customary expression. Small red brows wrinkled in a ferocious scowl, making the resemblance startling. Surprised into laughter, Roger gasped and choked, then coughed until he doubled over, wheezing.

â€œAre you all right?â€ Brianna had unearthed herself and was sitting up in bed, squint-eyed with sleep, but looking concerned.

â€œAye, fine.â€ The words came out in a thready wheeze, nearly soundless. He took a breath and hawked deeply, expectorating a repellent glob into his hand, for lack of a handkerchief.

â€œEew!â€ said the tender wife of his bosom, recoiling.

â€œLemme see, Daddy!â€ said his son and heir, jostling for a look. â€œEeew!â€

Roger stepped outside and wiped his hand in the wet grass by the door. It was cold out, so early, but Crombie was undoubtedly right; snow was on the way again. The air had that soft, muffled feel to it.

â€œSo old Mrs. Wilson is dead?â€ Brianna had come out after him, a shawl wrapped round her shoulders. â€œThatâ€™s too bad. Imagine coming so far, and then dying in a strange place, before youâ€™ve even had time to settle.â€

â€œWell, she had her family with her, at least. I expect she wouldna have wanted to be left alone to die in Scotland.â€

â€œMm.â€ Bree brushed strands of hair off her cheeks; sheâ€™d put her hair into a thick plait for sleeping, but a good bit of it had escaped from captivity and was waving up round her face in the cold, humid air. â€œShould I go up there, do you think?â€

â€œPay our respects? He said theyâ€™ve laid the old lady out already.â€

She snorted, white wisps of breath from her nostrils momentarily making him think of dragons.

â€œIt canâ€™t be later than seven A.M.; itâ€™s still bloody dark out! And I donâ€™t believe for a minute that his wife and sister have been laying out the old lady by candlelight. Hiram would balk at the expense of the extra candle, for one thing. No, he felt itchy about asking a favor, so he was trying to get under your skin about your wife being a lazy slattern.â€

That was perceptive, Roger thought, amusedâ€”particularly as she hadnâ€™t seen Crombieâ€™s eloquent glance at her recumbent form.

â€œWhatâ€™s a slattern?â€ Jemmy inquired, picking up instantly on anything vaguely improper-sounding.

â€œThatâ€™s a lady whoâ€™s no lady,â€ Roger informed him. â€œAnd a bad housekeeper, to boot.â€

â€œThatâ€™s one of the words that Mrs. Bug will wash out your mouth with soap if she hears you say it,â€ amended his wife with ungrammatical acuity.

Roger was still attired in nothing but a nightshirt, and his legs and feet were freezing. Jem was hopping around barefoot, too, but without the slightest sign of being cold.

â€œMummy is not one,â€ Roger said firmly, taking Jemâ€™s hand. â€œCome on, chum, letâ€™s nip up to the privy while Mummy makes breakfast.â€

â€œThanks for the vote of confidence,â€ Brianna said, yawning. â€œIâ€™ll take up a jar of honey or something to the Crombies later.â€

â€œI go, too,â€ Jemmy announced promptly.

Brianna hesitated for a moment, then looked at Roger and raised her brows. Jem had never seen a dead person.

Roger lifted one shoulder. It would have been a peaceful death, and it was, God knew, a fact of life on the mountain. He didnâ€™t suppose that seeing Mrs. Wilsonâ€™s body would give the child nightmaresâ€”though knowing Jem, it was quite likely to lead to a number of loud and embarrassing public questions. A bit of preparatory explanation might not be out of place, he reflected.

â€œSure,â€ he told Jem. â€œBut first we have to go up to the Big House after breakfast, and borrow a Bible from Grandda.â€



HE FOUND JAMIE at breakfast, the warm oatmeal smell of fresh parritch wrapping him like a blanket as he stepped into the kitchen. Before he could explain his errand, Mrs. Bug had sat him down with a bowl of his own, a jug of honey, a plate of savory fried bacon, hot toast dripping butter, and a fresh cup of something dark and fragrant that looked like coffee. Jem was next to him, already smeared with honey and buttered to the ears. For a traitorous instant, he wondered whether Brianna was perhaps a bit of a sluggard, though certainly never a slattern.

Then he glanced across the table at Claire, uncombed hair standing on end as she blinked sleepily at him over the toast, and generously concluded that it probably wasnâ€™t a conscious choice on Breeâ€™s part, but rather the influence of genetics.

Claire roused at once, though, when he explained his errand, between bites of bacon and toast.

â€œOld Mrs. Wilson?â€ she asked with interest. â€œWhat did she die of, did Mr. Crombie say?â€

Roger shook his head, swallowing oatmeal.

â€œOnly that sheâ€™d passed in the night. I suppose they found her dead. Her heart, maybeâ€”she must have been at least eighty.â€

â€œShe was about five years older than I am,â€ Claire said dryly. â€œShe told me.â€

â€œOh. Mmphm.â€ Clearing his throat hurt, and he took a sip of the hot, dark stuff in his cup. It was a brew of roasted chicory and acorns, but not that bad.

â€œI hope ye didna tell her how old you are, Sassenach.â€ Jamie reached across and snared the last piece of toast. Mrs. Bug, ever-vigilant, whisked the plate away to refill it.

â€œIâ€™m not that careless,â€ Claire said, dabbing a forefinger delicately into a smear of honey and licking it. â€œThey already think Iâ€™ve made some sort of pact with the devil; if I told them my age, theyâ€™d be sure of it.â€

Roger chuckled, but thought privately that she was right. The marks of her ordeal had nearly vanished, bruises faded and the bridge of her nose healed straight and clean. Even unkempt and puffy-eyed from sleep, she was more than handsome, with lovely skin, lushly thick curly hair, and an elegance of feature undreamt of among the Highland fisher-folk. To say nothing of the eyes, sherry-gold and startling.

Add to these natural gifts the twentieth-century practices of nutrition and hygieneâ€”she had all of her teeth, white and straightâ€”and she easily appeared a good twenty years younger than other women of her own age. He found that a comforting thought; perhaps Bree had inherited the art of aging beautifully from her mother, as well. He could always make his own breakfast, after all.

Jamie had finished his own meal and gone to fetch the Bible. He came back, laying it beside Rogerâ€™s plate.

â€œWeâ€™ll go up with ye to the burying,â€ he said, nodding at the book. â€œMrs. Bugâ€”can ye maybe put up a wee basket for the Crombies?â€

â€œDone it already,â€ she informed him, and plunked a large basket on the table before him, covered with a napkin and bulging with goodies. â€œYeâ€™ll take it, then? I must go tell Arch and fetch my good shawl, and weâ€™ll see ye at the graveside, aye?â€

Brianna came in then, yawning but well-groomed, and set about making Jem presentable while Claire vanished to find cap and shawl. Roger picked up the Bible, intending to thumb through the Psalms for something suitably somber but uplifting.

â€œMaybe the Twenty-third?â€ he said, half to himself. â€œNice and short. Always a classic. And it does mention death, at least.â€

â€œAre you going to give a eulogy?â€ Brianna asked, interested. â€œOr a sermon?â€

â€œOh, Christ, I hadnâ€™t thought of that,â€ he said in dismay. He cleared his throat experimentally. â€œIs there more coffee?â€

Heâ€™d been to a great many funerals in Inverness presided over by the Reverend, and was well aware that the paying customers considered such an event a dismal failure unless the preaching went on for at least half an hour. Granted, beggars couldnâ€™t be choosers, and the Crombies couldnâ€™t expectâ€”

â€œWhy do you have a Protestant Bible, Da?â€ Bree paused in the act of disentangling a piece of toast from Jemmyâ€™s hair, peering over Rogerâ€™s shoulder.

Surprised, he shut the cover, but she was right; King James Version, it said, the letters of the inscription nearly worn away.

â€œIt was given to me,â€ Jamie said. The reply was casual, but Roger glanced up; there was something odd in Jamieâ€™s voice. Brianna heard it, too; she shot her father a brief, sharp look, but his face was tranquil as he took a final bite of bacon and wiped his lips.

â€œDâ€™ye want a dram in your coffee, Roger Mac?â€ he said, nodding at Rogerâ€™s cup, as though it were the most natural thing in the world to offer whisky with breakfast.

In fact, the notion sounded really appealing, given the immediate prospects, but Roger shook his head.

â€œNo, thanks; Iâ€™ll do.â€

â€œAre you sure?â€ Brianna transferred the sharp look to him. â€œMaybe you should. For your throat.â€

â€œItâ€™ll be fine,â€ he said shortly. He was worried about his voice himself; he didnâ€™t need solicitude from the redheaded contingent, all three of whom were giving him thoughtful looks that he interpreted as casting extreme doubt upon his speaking abilities. Whisky might help his throat, but he doubted it would do much for his preachingâ€”and the last thing he wanted was to show up at a funeral reeking of strong drink in front of a lot of strict teetotalers.

â€œVinegar,â€ advised Mrs. Bug, bending to take away his plate. â€œHot vinegarâ€™s the thing. Cuts the phlegm, aye?â€

â€œIâ€™ll bet it would,â€ Roger said, smiling despite his misgivings. â€œBut I think I wonâ€™t, Mrs. Bug, thanks.â€ Heâ€™d awakened with a slight sore throat, and hoped the consumption of breakfast would cure it. It hadnâ€™t, and the thought of drinking hot vinegar made his tonsils seize up.

He held out his cup for more chicory coffee, instead, and set his mind to the task ahead.

â€œNowâ€”does anyone know anything about old Mrs. Wilson?â€

â€œSheâ€™s dead,â€ Jemmy piped up confidently. Everybody laughed, and Jem looked confused, but then joined the laughter, though plainly having not the slightest idea what was funny.

â€œGood start, sport.â€ Roger reached out and brushed crumbs from Jemmyâ€™s shirtfront. â€œMight be a point, at that. The Reverend had a decent sermon on something in the Epistlesâ€”the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life. I heard him give it more than once. What dâ€™ye think?â€ He raised a brow at Brianna, who frowned in thought and picked up the Bible.

â€œThat would probably work. Does this thing have a concordance?â€

â€œNo.â€ Jamie put down his coffee cup. â€œItâ€™s in Romans, chapter six, though.â€ Seeing the looks of surprise turned upon him, he flushed slightly, and jerked his head toward the Bible.

â€œI had that book in prison,â€ he said. â€œI read it. Come along, a bhailach, are ye ready now?â€



THE WEATHER WAS louring, clouds threatening anything from freezing rain to the first snow of the season, and occasional cold gusts of wind catching cloaks and skirts, bellying them out like sails. The men held tight to their hats, and the women huddled deep in their hoods, all walking with their heads down, like sheep pushing stubbornly into the wind.

â€œGreat weather for a funeral,â€ Brianna murmured, pulling her cloak tight around her after one such gust.

â€œMmphm.â€ Roger responded automatically, obviously unaware of what sheâ€™d said, but registering that sheâ€™d spoken. His brow was furrowed, and he seemed tight-lipped and pale. She put a hand on his arm, squeezing in reassurance, and he glanced at her with a faint smile, his face easing.

An unearthly wail cut through the air, and Brianna froze, clutching Rogerâ€™s arm. It rose to a shriek, then broke in a series of short, jerky gulps, coming down a scale of sobs like a dead body rolling down a staircase.

Gooseflesh prickled down her spine and her stomach clenched. She glanced at Roger; he looked nearly as pale as she felt, though he pressed her hand reassuringly.

â€œThat will be the ban-treim,â€ her father remarked calmly. â€œI didna ken there was one.â€

â€œNeither did I,â€ said her mother. â€œWho do you suppose it is?â€ She had startled, too, at the sound of it, but now looked merely interested.

Roger had been holding his breath, too; he let it out now, with a small rattling sound, and cleared his throat.

â€œA mourning woman,â€ he said. The words emerged thickly, and he cleared his throat again, much harder. â€œThey, um, keen. After the coffin.â€

The voice rose again out of the wood, this time with a more deliberate sound. Brianna thought there were words in the wailing, but couldnâ€™t make them out. Wendigo. The word came unbidden into her mind, and she shivered convulsively. Jemmy whimpered, trying to burrow inside his grandfatherâ€™s coat.

â€œItâ€™s nothing to fear, a bhailach.â€ He patted Jemmy on the back. Jem appeared unconvinced, and put his thumb in his mouth, huddling round-eyed into Jamieâ€™s chest as the wailing faded into moans.

â€œWell, come, then, weâ€™ll meet her, shall we?â€ Jamie turned aside and began making his way into the forest, toward the voice.

There was nothing to do but follow. Brianna squeezed Rogerâ€™s arm, but left him, walking close to her father so Jemmy could see her and be reassured.

â€œItâ€™s okay, pal,â€ she said softly. The weather was growing colder; her breath puffed out in wisps of white. The end of Jemmyâ€™s nose was red and his eyes seemed a little pink around the edgesâ€”was he catching a cold, too?

She put out a hand to touch his forehead, but just then the voice broke out afresh. This time, though, something seemed to have happened to it. It was a high, thready sound, not the robust keening theyâ€™d heard before. And uncertainâ€”like an apprentice ghost, she thought in uneasy jest.

An apprentice it proved to be, though not a ghost. Her father ducked under a low pine and she followed him, emerging in a clearing facing two surprised women. Or rather, a woman and a teenaged girl, with shawls wrapped over their heads. She knew them, but what were their names?

â€œMaduinn mhath, maighistear,â€ the older woman said, recovering from her surprise and dropping into a low curtsy to Jamie. Good morn to you, sir.

â€œAnd to you, my mistresses,â€ he replied, also in Gaelic.

â€œGood morn, Mrs. Gwilty,â€ Roger said in his soft, hoarse voice. â€œAnd to you, a nighean,â€ he added, bowing courteously to the girl. Olanna, that was it; Brianna recalled the round face, just like the â€œOâ€ that began her name. She was Mrs. Gwiltyâ€™s . . . daughter? Or her niece?

â€œAch, bonny boy,â€ the girl crooned, reaching out a finger to touch Jemâ€™s rounded cheek. He pulled back a little and sucked harder on his thumb, watching her suspiciously under the edge of his blue woolly bonnet.

The women spoke no English, but Briannaâ€™s Gaelic was sufficient by now to allow her to follow the conversation, if not to join fluently in it. Mrs. Gwilty was, she explained, showing her niece the way of a proper coronach.

â€œAnd a fine job of work you will make of it between you, Iâ€™m sure,â€ Jamie said politely.

Mrs. Gwilty sniffed, and gave her niece a disparaging look.

â€œMmphm,â€ she said. â€œA voice like a bat farting, but she is the only woman left of my family, and I shall not live forever.â€

Roger made a small choking noise, which he hastily developed into a convincing cough. Olannaâ€™s pleasant round face, already flushed from the cold, went a blotchy red, but she said nothing, merely cast her eyes down and huddled deeper into her shawl. It was a dark brown homespun, Brianna saw; Mrs. Gwiltyâ€™s was a fine wool, dyed blackâ€”and if it was a trifle frayed around the edges, she wore it still with the dignity of her profession.

â€œIt is sorrowful we are for you,â€ Jamie said, in formal condolence. â€œShe who is gone . . . ?â€ He paused in delicate inquiry.

â€œMy fatherâ€™s sister,â€ answered Mrs. Gwilty promptly. â€œWoe, woe, that she should be buried among strangers.â€ She had a lean, underfed face, the spare flesh deeply hollowed and bruised-looking round dark eyes. She turned these deep-set eyes on Jemmy, who promptly grabbed the edge of his bonnet and pulled it down over his face. Seeing the dark, bottomless eyes swivel in her direction, Brianna was hard-pressed not to do the same.

â€œI hopeâ€”that her shade will find comfort. Withâ€”with your family being here,â€ Claire said, in her halting Gaelic. It sounded most peculiar in her motherâ€™s English accent, and Brianna saw her father bite his lower lip in order not to smile.

â€œShe will not lack company for long.â€ Olanna blurted it out, then, catching Jamieâ€™s eye, went beet-red and buried her nose in her shawl.

This odd statement seemed to make sense to her father, who nodded.

â€œOch, so? Who is it ails?â€ He looked at her mother in question, but she shook her head slightly. If anyone was sick, they hadnâ€™t sought her help.

Mrs. Gwiltyâ€™s long, seamed upper lip pressed down over dreadful teeth.

â€œSeaumais Buchan,â€ she remarked with grim satisfaction. â€œHe lies fevered and his chest will kill him before the week is out, but weâ€™ve beaten him. A fortunate thing.â€

â€œWhat?â€ said Claire, frowning in bewilderment.

Mrs. Gwiltyâ€™s eyes narrowed at her.

â€œThe last person buried in a graveyard must stand watch over it, Sassenach,â€ Jamie explained in English. â€œUntil another comes to take his place.â€

Switching smoothly back to Gaelic, he said, â€œFortunate is she, and the more fortunate, in having such bean-treim to follow her.â€ He put a hand into his pocket and handed over a coin, which Mrs. Gwilty glanced at, then blinked and looked again.

â€œAh,â€ she said, gratified. â€œWell, we will do our best, the girl and I. Come then, a nighean, let me hear you.â€

Olanna, thus pressed to perform before company, looked terrified. Under her auntâ€™s monitory eye, though, there was no escape. Closing her eyes, she inflated her chest, thrust back her shoulders, and emitted a piercing, â€œEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEeeeEEE-uh-Ee-uh-Ee-uh,â€ before breaking off, gasping for breath.

Roger flinched as though the sound were bamboo splinters being shoved under his fingernails and Claireâ€™s mouth dropped open. Jemmyâ€™s shoulders were hunched up round his ears, and he clung to his grandfatherâ€™s coat like a small blue bur. Even Jamie looked a little startled.

â€œNot bad,â€ said Mrs. Gwilty judiciously. â€œPerhaps it will not be a complete disgrace. I am hearing that Hiram asked you to speak a word?â€ she added with a disparaging glance at Roger.

â€œHe has,â€ Roger replied, still hoarse, but as firmly as possible. â€œI am honored.â€

Mrs. Gwilty did not reply to this, but merely looked him up and down, then, shaking her head, turned her back and raised her arms.

â€œAaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAaaaaAAAAAAAaaaIIIIeeeeeeee,â€ she wailed, in a voice that made Brianna feel ice crystals in her blood. â€œWoe, woe, woooooooooooe! AAaayaaaAAaayaaaAAhaaaaahaaa! Woe is come to the house of Crombieâ€”Woe!â€

Dutifully turning her back on them, as well, Olanna joined in with a descant wail of her own. Claire rather untactfully but practically put her fingers in her ears.

â€œHow much did you give them?â€ she asked Jamie in English.

Jamieâ€™s shoulders shook briefly, and he hastily ushered her away, a firm hand on her elbow.

Beside Brianna, Roger swallowed, the sound just audible under the noise.

â€œYou should have had that drink,â€ she said to him.

â€œI know,â€ he said hoarsely, and sneezed.



â€œHAVE YOU EVEN heard of Seaumais Buchan?â€ I asked Jamie, as we picked our way across the sodden earth of the Crombieâ€™s dooryard. â€œWho is he?â€

â€œOh, Iâ€™ve heard of him, aye,â€ he replied, putting an arm round me to help swing me across a fetid puddle of what looked like goat urine. â€œOof. God, youâ€™re a solid wee thing, Sassenach.â€

â€œThatâ€™s the basket,â€ I replied absently. â€œI believe Mrs. Bugâ€™s put lead shot in it. Or maybe only fruitcake. Who is he, then? One of the fisher-folk?â€

â€œAye. Heâ€™s great-uncle to Maisie MacArdle, her whoâ€™s marrit to him that was a boatbuilder. Ye recall her? Red hair and a verra long nose, six bairns.â€

â€œVaguely. However do you remember these things?â€ I demanded, but he merely smiled, and offered me his arm. I took it, and we strode gravely through the mud and the scattered straw laid down across it, the laird and his lady come to the funeral.

The door of the cabin was open despite the cold, to let the spirit of the dead go out. Fortunately, it also let a little light come in, as the cabin was crudely built and had no windows. It was also completely packed with people, most of whom had not bathed any time in the preceding four months.

I was no stranger to claustrophobic cabins or unwashed bodies, though, and since I knew that one of the bodies present was probably clean but certainly dead, I had already begun breathing through my mouth by the time one of the Crombie daughters, shawled and red-eyed, invited us in.

Grannie Wilson was laid out on the table with a candle at her head, wrapped in the shroud she had no doubt woven as a new bride; the linen cloth was yellowed and creased with age, but clean and soft in the candlelight, embroidered on the edges with a simple pattern of vine leaves. It had been carefully kept, brought from Scotland at the cost of who knew what pains.

Jamie paused at the door, removing his hat, and murmured formal condolences, which the Crombies, male and female, accepted with nods and grunts, respectively. I handed over the basket of food and nodded back, with what I hoped was a suitable expression of dignified sympathy, keeping an eye on Jemmy.

Brianna had done her best to explain to him, but I had no idea what he might make of the situationâ€”or the corpse. He had been persuaded with some difficulty to emerge from his bonnet, and was looking round now with interest, his cowlick standing on end.

â€œIs that the dead lady, Grandma?â€ he whispered loudly to me, pointing at the body.

â€œYes, dear,â€ I said, with an uneasy glance at old Mrs. Wilson. She looked perfectly all right, though, done up properly in her best cap with a bandage under her jaw to keep her mouth closed, dry eyelids sealed against the glimmer of the candle. I didnâ€™t think Jemmy had ever met the old lady in life; there was no real reason for him to be upset at seeing her deadâ€”and heâ€™d been taken hunting regularly since he could walk; he certainly understood the concept of death. Besides, a corpse was definitely anticlimactic, after our encounter with the bean-treim. Still . . .

â€œWeâ€™ll pay our respects now, lad,â€ Jamie said quietly to him, and set him on the floor. I caught Jamieâ€™s glance at the door, where Roger and Bree were murmuring condolences in their turn, and realized he had been waiting for them to catch up, so that they could watch him, and know what to do next.

He led Jemmy through the press of people, who gave way respectfully, and up to the table, where he laid his hand on the corpseâ€™s chest. Oh, so it was that sort of funeral.

At some Highland funerals, it was the custom for everyone to touch the body, so that the dead person should not haunt them. I doubted that Grannie Wilson would have any interest in haunting me, but care never hurtâ€”and I did have an uneasy memory of a skull with silver fillings in its teeth, and my encounter with what might have been its possessor, seen by corpse-light on a black mountain night. Despite myself, I glanced at the candle, but it seemed a perfectly normal thing of brown beeswax, pleasantly fragrant and leaning a little crooked in its pottery candlestick.

Steeling myself, I leaned over and laid my own hand gently on the shroud. An earthenware saucer, holding a piece of bread and a heap of salt, sat on the dead womanâ€™s chest, and a small wooden bowl filled with dark liquidâ€”wine?â€”sat beside her on the table. What with the good beeswax candle, the salt, and the bean-treim, it looked as though Hiram Crombie was trying to do right by his late mother-in-lawâ€”though I wouldnâ€™t put it past him to thriftily reuse the salt after the funeral.

Something seemed wrong, though; an air of uneasiness curled among the cracked boots and rag-wrapped feet of the crowd like the cold draft from the door. At first I had thought it might be due to our presence, but that wasnâ€™t it; there had been a brief exhalation of approval when Jamie approached the body.

Jamie whispered to Jemmy, then boosted him up, legs dangling, to touch the corpse. He showed no reluctance, and peered into the dead womanâ€™s waxen face with interest.

â€œWhatâ€™s that for?â€ he asked loudly, reaching for the bread. â€œIs she going to eat it?â€

Jamie grabbed his wrist, and planted his hand firmly on the shroud instead.

â€œThatâ€™s for the sin-eater, a bhailach. Leave it, aye?â€

â€œWhatâ€™s aâ€”â€

â€œLater.â€ No one argued with Jamie when he used that tone of voice, and Jemmy subsided, putting his thumb back in his mouth as Jamie set him down. Bree came up and scooped him into her arms, belatedly remembering to touch the corpse herself, and murmur, â€œGod rest you.â€

Then Roger stepped forward, and there was a stir of interest among the crowd.

He looked pale, but composed. His face was lean and rather ascetic, usually saved from sternness by the gentleness of his eyes and a mobile mouth, ready to laugh. This was no time for laughter, though, and his eyes were bleak in the dim light.

He laid a hand on the dead womanâ€™s chest, and bowed his head. I wasnâ€™t sure whether he was praying for the repose of her soul, or for inspiration, but he stayed that way for more than minute. The crowd watched respectfully, with no sound save coughs and the clearing of throats. Roger wasnâ€™t the only one catching a cold, I thoughtâ€”and thought suddenly again of Seaumais Buchan.

â€œHe lies fevered and his chest will kill him before the week is out.â€ So Mrs. Gwilty had said. Pneumonia, perhapsâ€”or bronchitis, or even consumption. And no one had told me.

I felt a slight pang at that, equal parts annoyance, guilt, and unease. I knew the new tenants didnâ€™t yet trust me; I had thought that I should allow them to get used to me before I started dropping in on them at random. Many of them would never have seen an English person, before coming to the coloniesâ€”and I was well aware of their attitude toward both Sassenachs and Catholics.

But evidently there was now a man dying virtually on my doorstepâ€”and I hadnâ€™t even known of his existence, let alone his illness.

Should I go to see him, as soon as the funeral was over? But where in bloody hell did the man live? It couldnâ€™t be very close; I did know all the fisher-folk who had settled down the mountain; the MacArdles must be up across the ridge. I stole a look at the door, trying to judge how soon the threatening clouds would cut loose their burden of snow.

There were shufflings and the murmurs of low speech outside; more people had arrived, coming up from the nearby hollows, crowding round the door. I caught the words, â€œdÃ¨an caithris,â€ in a questioning tone, and suddenly realized what was odd about the present occasion.

There was no wake. Customarily, the body would have been washed and laid out, but then kept on display for a day or two, to allow everyone in the area time to come and pay their regards. Listening intently, I caught a distinct tone of disgruntlement and surpriseâ€”the neighbors thought this haste unseemly.

â€œWhy isnâ€™t there a wake?â€ I whispered to Jamie. He lifted one shoulder a fraction of an inch, but nodded toward the door, and the muffled sky beyond.

â€œThereâ€™s going to be a great deal of snow by nightfall, a Sorcha,â€ he said. â€œAnd likely to go on for days, by the looks of it. I wouldna want to be having to dig a grave and bury a coffin in the midst of that, myself. And should it snow for days, where are they to put the body in the meantime?â€

â€œThatâ€™s true, Mac Dubh,â€ said Kenny Lindsay, overhearing. He glanced round at the people near us, and edged closer, lowering his voice. â€œBut itâ€™s true, too, as Hiram Crombieâ€™s no owerfond of the auld besâ€”er, his good-mother.â€ He raised his chin a fraction, indicating the corpse. â€œSome say as he canna get the auld woman underground fast enoughâ€”before she changes her mind, aye?â€ He grinned briefly, and Jamie hid his own smile, looking down.

â€œSaves a bit on the food, too, I suppose.â€ Hiramâ€™s reputation as a cheapskate was well-knownâ€”which was saying something, among the thrifty but hospitable Highlanders.

A fresh bustle was taking place outside, as new arrivals came. There was a sort of congestion at the door, as someone sought to press inside, though the house was filled shoulder to shoulder, with the only bit of open floor space left under the table on which Mrs. Wilson reposed.

The people near the door gave way reluctantly, and Mrs. Bug surged into the cabin, arrayed in her best cap and shawl, Arch at her shoulder.

â€œYe forgot the whisky, sir,â€ she informed Jamie, handing him a corked bottle. Looking round, she at once spotted the Crombies and bowed to them ceremoniously, murmuring sympathy. Bobbing upright, she set her cap straight and looked expectantly round. Clearly, the festivities could now commence.

Hiram Crombie glanced round, then nodded to Roger.

Roger drew himself up slightly, nodded back, and began. He spoke simply for a few minutes, generalities about the preciousness of life, the enormity of death, and the importance of kin and neighbors in facing such things. This all seemed to be going over well with the punters, who were nodding slightly in approval and seemed to be settling down in expectation of decent entertainment.

Roger paused to cough and blow his nose, then shifted into what appeared to be some version of the Presbyterian funeral serviceâ€”or what he recalled of it, from his life with the Reverend Wakefield.

This too seemed to be acceptable. Bree seemed to relax a little, and put Jemmy down.

It was going well . . . and yet I was still conscious of a faint sense of uneasiness. Part of that, of course, was that I could see Roger. The growing warmth of the cabin was making his nose run; he kept his handkerchief in his hand, dabbing furtively and now and then stopping to blow his nose as discreetly as possible.

Phlegm, though, runs downhill. And as the congestion got worse, it began to affect his vulnerable throat. The choked note in his voice, always present, was getting noticeably worse. He was having to clear his throat repeatedly, in order to speak.

Beside me, Jemmy stirred restively, and from the corner of my eye, I saw Bree put a hand on his head to quiet him. He looked up at her, but her attention was fixed anxiously on Roger.

â€œWe give thanks to God for the life of this woman,â€ he said, and paused to clear his throatâ€”again. I found myself doing it with him in sheer nervous sympathy.

â€œShe is a servant of God, faithful and true, and now praises Him before His throne, with the saâ€”â€ I saw sudden doubt flicker across his face as to whether his present congregation countenanced the concept of saints, or would consider such a mention to be Romish heresy. He coughed, and resumed, â€œWith the angels.â€

Evidently angels were innocuous; the faces around me looked somber, but unoffended. Exhaling visibly, Roger picked up the little green Bible and opened it at a marked page.

â€œLet us speak together a psalm in praise of Him whoâ€”â€ He glanced at the page and, too late, realized the difficulty of translating an English psalm into Gaelic on the wing.

He cleared his throat explosively, and half a dozen throats among the crowd echoed him in reflex. On my other side, Jamie murmured, â€œOh, God,â€ in heartfelt prayer.

Jemmy tugged at his motherâ€™s skirt, whispering something, but was peremptorily shushed. I could see Bree yearning toward Roger, body tensed in the urgent desire to help somehow, if only by mental telepathy.

With no alternative in sight, Roger began to read the psalm, haltingly. Half the crowd had taken him at his word when he invited them to â€œspeak together,â€ and were reciting the psalm from memoryâ€”several times faster than he could read.

I closed my eyes, unable to watch, but there was no way to avoid hearing, as the congregation ripped through the psalm and fell silent, waiting in dour patience for Roger to stumble his way to the end. Which he did, doggedly.

â€œAmen,â€ said Jamie loudly. And alone. I opened my eyes to find everyone staring at us, with looks ranging from mild surprise to glowering hostility. Jamie took a deep breath and let it out, very slowly.

â€œJesus. Christ,â€ he said very softly.

A bead of sweat ran down Rogerâ€™s cheek, and he wiped it away with the sleeve of his coat.

â€œWould anyone wish to say a few words regarding the deceased?â€ he asked, glancing from face to face. Silence and the whine of the wind answered him.

He cleared his throat, and someone snickered.

â€œGrannieâ€”â€ whispered Jemmy, tugging on my skirt.

â€œShh.â€

â€œBut Grandmaâ€”â€ The sense of urgency in his voice made me turn and look down at him.

â€œDo you need to go to the privy?â€ I whispered, bending down to him. He shook his head, violently enough to make the heavy mop of red-gold hair flop to and fro on his forehead.

â€œO, God, our Heavenly Father, who art leading us through the changes of time to the rest and blessedness of eternity, be Thou near to us now, to comfort and to uphold.â€

I glanced up, to see that Roger had laid his hand once more on the corpse, evidently deciding to bring the proceedings to a close. From the relief evident in his face and voice, I thought he must be falling back on some accustomed prayer from the Book of Common Worship, familiar enough to him that he could manage it with fair fluency in Gaelic.

â€œMake us to know that Thy children are precious in Thy sight. . . .â€ He stopped, visibly struggling; the muscles of his throat worked, trying vainly to clear the obstruction in silence, but it was no good.

â€œErr . . . HRRM!â€ A sound, not quite laughter, ran through the room, and Bree made a small rumbling noise in her own throat, like a volcano getting ready to spew lava.

â€œGrannie!â€

â€œShh!â€

â€œ. . . thy sight. That they . . . live evermore with Thee and that Thy mercyâ€”â€

â€œGrannie!â€

Jemmy was wiggling as though a colony of ants had taken up residence in his breeches, an expression of agonized urgency on his face.

â€œI am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord; he that believeth in Me, though he were dead . . . rr-hm . . . yet shall he liveâ€”â€ With the end in sight, Roger was making a gallant finish, forcing his voice past its limits, hoarser than ever and cracking on every other word, but firm and loud.

â€œJust a minute,â€ I hissed. â€œIâ€™ll take you out in aâ€”â€

â€œNo, Grannie! Look!â€

I followed his outthrust finger, and for a moment, thought he was pointing at his father. But he wasnâ€™t.

Old Mrs. Wilson had opened her eyes.



THERE WAS AN INSTANTâ€™S silence, as everyoneâ€™s eyes fastened at once on Mrs. Wilson. Then there was a collective gasp, and an instinctive stepping back, with shrieks of dismay and cries of pain as toes were trodden on and people squashed against the unyielding rough logs of the walls.

Jamie grabbed Jemmy up off the floor in time to save his being crushed, inflated his lungs, and bellowed, â€œSheas!â€ at the top of his voice. Such was his volume that the crowd did indeed freeze momentarilyâ€”long enough for him to thrust Jemmy into Briannaâ€™s arms and elbow his way toward the table.

Roger had got hold of the erstwhile corpse, and was lifting her into a sitting position, her hand feebly flapping at the bandage round her jaws. I pushed after Jamie, ruthlessly shoving people out of the way.

â€œGive her a bit of air, please,â€ I said, raising my voice. The stunned silence was giving way to a rising murmur of excitement, but this quelled as I fumbled to untie the bandage. The room waited in quivering expectation as the corpse worked stiff jaws.

â€œWhere am I?â€ she said in a quavering voice. Her gaze passed disbelievingly round the room, settling at last on her daughterâ€™s face.

â€œMairi?â€ she said dubiously, and Mrs. Crombie rushed forward and fell on her knees, bursting into tears as she gripped her motherâ€™s hands.

â€œA MÃ thair! A MÃ thair!â€ she cried. The old woman set a trembling hand on her daughterâ€™s hair, looking as though she were not quite sure she was real.

I, meanwhile, had been doing my best to check the old ladyâ€™s vital signs, which were not all that vital, but nonetheless fairly good for someone who had been dead a moment before. Respiration very shallow, labored, a color like week-old oatmeal, cold, clammy skin despite the heat in the room, and I couldnâ€™t find a pulse at allâ€”though plainly she must have one. Mustnâ€™t she?

â€œHow do you feel?â€ I asked.

She put a trembling hand to her belly.

â€œI do feel that wee bit poorly,â€ she whispered.

I put my own hand on her abdomen, and felt it instantly. A pulse, where no pulse should be. It was irregular, stumbling, and bumpingâ€”but most assuredly there.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,â€ I said. I didnâ€™t say it loudly, but Mrs. Crombie gasped, and I saw her apron twitch, as she doubtless made the horns beneath it.

I hadnâ€™t time to bother with apology, but stood and grabbed Roger by the sleeve, pulling him aside.

â€œShe has an aortic aneurysm,â€ I said to him very softly. â€œShe must have been bleeding internally for some time, enough to make her lose consciousness and seem cold. Itâ€™s going to rupture very soon, and then sheâ€™ll die for real.â€

He swallowed audibly, his face very pale, but said only, â€œDo you know how long?â€

I glanced at Mrs. Wilson; her face was the same gray as the snow-laden sky, and her eyes were going in and out of focus like the flickering of a candle in a wind.

â€œI see,â€ Roger said, though I hadnâ€™t spoken. He took a deep breath and cleared his throat.

The crowd, which had been hissing amongst themselves like a flock of agitated geese, ceased at once. Every eye in the place was riveted on the tableau before them.

â€œThis our sister has been restored to life, as we all shall be one day by the grace of God,â€ Roger said softly. â€œIt is a sign to us, of hope and faith. She will go soon again to the arms of the angels, but has come back to us for a moment, to bring us assurance of Godâ€™s love.â€ He paused a moment, obviously groping for something further to say. He cleared his throat and bent his head toward Mrs. Wilsonâ€™s.

â€œDid you . . . wish to say anything, O, mother?â€ he whispered in Gaelic.

â€œAye, I do.â€ Mrs. Wilson seemed to be gaining strengthâ€”and with it, indignation. A faint pinkness showed in her waxy cheeks as she glared round at the crowd.

â€œWhat sort of wake is this, Hiram Crombie?â€ she demanded, fixing her son-in-law with a gimlet eye. â€œI see nay food laid out, nay drinkâ€”and what is this?â€ Her voice rose in a furious squeak, her eye having fallen on the plate of bread and salt, which Roger had hastily set aside when he lifted her.

â€œWhyâ€”â€ She looked wildly round at the assembled crowd, and the truth of it dawned upon her. Her sunken eyes bulged. â€œWhy . . . ye shameless skinflint! This is nay wake at all! Yeâ€™ve meant to bury me wiâ€™ nothing but a crust oâ€™ bread and a drap oâ€™ wine for the sin-eater, and a wonder ye spared that! Nay doot yeâ€™ll thieve the winding claes from my corpse to make cloots for your snotty-nosed bairns, and whereâ€™s my good brooch I said I wanted to be buried with?â€ One scrawny hand closed on her shrunken bosom, catching a fistful of wilted linen.

â€œMairi! My brooch!â€

â€œHere it is, Mother, here it is!â€ Poor Mrs. Crombie, altogether undone, was fumbling in her pocket, sobbing and gasping. â€œI put it away to be safeâ€”I meant to put it on ye beforeâ€”before . . .â€ She came out with an ugly lump of garnets, which her mother snatched from her, cradling it against her breast, and glaring round with jealous suspicion. Clearly she suspected her neighbors of waiting the chance to steal it from her body; I heard an offended inhalation from the woman standing behind me, but had no time to turn and see who it was.

â€œNow, now,â€ I said, using my best soothing bedside manner. â€œIâ€™m sure everything will be all right.â€ Aside from the fact that youâ€™re going to die in the next few minutes, that is, I thought, suppressing a hysterical urge to laugh inappropriately. Actually, it might be in the next few seconds, if her blood pressure rose any higher.

I had my fingers on the thumping big pulse in her abdomen that betrayed the fatal weakening of her abdominal aorta. It had to have begun to leak already, to make her lose consciousness to such a degree as to seem dead. Eventually, she would simply blow a gasket, and that would be it.

Roger and Jamie were both doing their best to soothe her, muttering in English and Gaelic and patting her comfortingly. She seemed to be responding to this treatment, though still breathing like a steam engine.

Jamieâ€™s production of the bottle of whisky from his pocket helped still further.

â€œWell, thatâ€™s more like it!â€ Mrs. Wilson said, somewhat mollified, as he hastily pulled the cork and waved the bottle under her nose so she could appreciate the quality of it. â€œAnd yeâ€™ve brought food, too?â€ Mrs. Bug had bustled her way to the front, basket held before her like a battering ram. â€œHmph! I never thought I should live to see Papists kinder than my ain kin!â€ This last was directed at Hiram Crombie, who had so far been opening and closing his mouth, without finding anything whatever to say in reply to his mother-in-lawâ€™s tirade.

â€œWhy . . . why . . .â€ he stammered in outrage, torn between shock, obvious fury, and a need to justify himself before his neighbors. â€œKinder than your ain kin! Why, have I not given ye a hame, these twenty years past? Fed and clothed ye as ye were my ain mither? B-borne your wicked tongue and foul t-tempers for years, and neverâ€”â€

Jamie and Roger both leapt in to try to stifle him, but instead interrupted each other, and in the confusion, Hiram was allowed to go on speaking his mind, which he did. So did Mrs. Wilson, who was no slouch at invective, either.

The pulse in her belly was throbbing under my hand, and I was hard put to it to keep her from leaping off the table and dotting Hiram with the bottle of whisky. The neighbors were agog.

Roger took mattersâ€”and Mrs. Wilsonâ€”firmly into his own hands, seizing her by her scrawny shoulders.

â€œMrs. Wilson,â€ he said hoarsely, but loudly enough to drown Hiramâ€™s indignant rebuttal of Mrs. Wilsonâ€™s most recent depiction of his character. â€œMrs. Wilson!â€

â€œEh?â€ She paused for breath, blinking up at him in momentary confusion.

â€œCease. And you, too!â€ He glared at Hiram, who was opening his mouth again. Hiram shut it.

â€œIâ€™ll no have this,â€ Roger said, and thumped the Bible down on the table. â€œItâ€™s not fitting, and Iâ€™ll not have it, dâ€™ye hear me?â€ He glowered from one to the other of the combatants, black brows low and fierce.

The room was silent, bar Hiramâ€™s heavy breathing, Mrs. Crombieâ€™s small sobs, and Mrs. Wilsonâ€™s faint, asthmatic wheeze.

â€œNow, then,â€ Roger said, still glaring round to prevent any further interruptions. He put a hand over Mrs. Wilsonâ€™s thin, age-spotted one.

â€œMrs. Wilsonâ€”dâ€™ye not ken that you stand before God this minute?â€ He darted a look at me, and I nodded; yes, she was definitely going to die. Her head was wobbling on her neck and the glow of anger fading from her eyes, even as he spoke.

â€œGod is near to us,â€ he said, lifting his head to address the congregation at large. He repeated this in Gaelic, and there was a sort of collective sigh. He narrowed his eyes at them.

â€œWe will not profane this holy occasion with anger nor bitterness. Nowâ€”sister.â€ He squeezed her hand gently. â€œCompose your soul. God willâ€”â€

But Mrs. Wilson was no longer listening. Her withered mouth dropped open in horror.

â€œThe sin-eater!â€ she cried, looking wildly round. She grabbed the dish from the table next to her, showering salt down the front of her winding-sheet. â€œWhere is the sin-eater?â€

Hiram stiffened as though goosed with a red-hot poker, then whirled and fought his way toward the door, the crowd giving way before him. Murmurs of speculation rose in his wake, only to stop abruptly as a piercing wail rose from outside, another rising behind it as the first one fell.

An awed â€œoooh!â€ rose from the crowd, and Mrs. Wilson looked gratified, as the bean-treim started in to earn their money in earnest.

Then there was a stirring near the door, and the crowd parted like the Red Sea, leaving a narrow path to the table. Mrs. Wilson sat bolt upright, dead-white and barely breathing. The pulse in her abdomen skittered and jumped under my fingers. Roger and Jamie had hold of her arms, supporting her.

A complete hush had fallen over the room; the only sounds were the howling of the bean-treimâ€”and slow, shuffling footsteps, soft on the ground outside, then suddenly louder on the boards of the floor. The sin-eater had arrived.

He was a tall man, or had been, once. It was impossible to tell his age; either years or illness had eaten away his flesh, so that his wide shoulders bowed and his spine had hunched, a gaunt head poking forward, crowned with a balding straggle of graying strands.

I glanced up at Jamie, eyebrows raised. I had never seen the man before. He shrugged slightly; he didnâ€™t know him, either. As the sin-eater came closer, I saw that his body was crooked; he seemed caved in on one side, ribs perhaps crushed by some accident.

Every eye was fixed on the man, but he met none of them, keeping his gaze focused on the floor. The path to the table was narrow, but the people shrank back as he passed, careful that he should not touch them. Only when he reached the table did he lift his head, and I saw that one eye was missing, evidently clawed away by a bear, judging from the welted mass of scar tissue.

The other one was working; he halted in surprise, seeing Mrs. Wilson, and glanced round, obviously unsure what to do next.

She wiggled one arm free of Rogerâ€™s grip and pushed the dish containing the bread and salt toward him.

â€œGet on, then,â€ she said, her voice high and a little frightened.

â€œBut youâ€™re not dead.â€ It was a soft, educated voice, betraying only puzzlement, but the crowd reacted as though it had been the hissing of a serpent, and recoiled further, if such a thing were possible.

â€œWell, what of it?â€ Agitation was making Mrs. Wilson tremble even more; I could feel a small constant vibration through the table. â€œYeâ€™ve been paid to eat my sinsâ€”be after doing it, then!â€ A thought occurred to her and she jerked upright, squinting at her son-in-law. â€œYe did pay him, Hiram?â€

Hiram was still flushed from the previous exchanges, but went a sort of puce at this, and clutched his sideâ€”clutching at his purse, I thought, rather than his heart.

â€œWell, Iâ€™m no going to pay him before heâ€™s done the job,â€ he snapped. â€œWhat sort of way is that to be carrying on?â€

Seeing renewed riot about to break out, Jamie let go his hold on Mrs. Wilson and fumbled hastily in his sporran, emerging with a silver shilling, which he thrust across the table toward the sin-eaterâ€”though careful, I saw, not to touch the man.

â€œNow yeâ€™ve been paid,â€ he said gruffly, nodding to him. â€œBest be about your business, sir.â€

The man looked slowly round the room, and the intake of breath from the crowd was audible, even over the wails of â€œWOOOOOOOOOOOEEEE to the house of CROMMMMBIIIEEEEEEâ€ going on outside.

He was standing no more than a foot away from me, close enough that I could smell the sweet-sour odor of him: ancient sweat and dirt in his rags, and something else, some faint aroma that spoke of pustulant sores and unhealed wounds. He turned his head and looked straight at me. It was a soft brown eye, amber in color, and startlingly like my own. Meeting his gaze gave me a queer feeling in the pit of the stomach, as though I looked for a moment into a distorting mirror, and saw that cruelly misshapen face replace my own.

He did not change expression, and yet I felt something nameless pass between us. Then he turned his head away, and reached out a long, weathered, very dirty hand to pick up the piece of bread.

A sort of sigh went through the room as he ateâ€”slowly gumming the bread, for he had few teeth. I could feel Mrs. Wilsonâ€™s pulse, much lighter now, and fast, like a hummingbirdâ€™s. She hung nearly limp in the menâ€™s grasp, the withered lids of her eyes drooping as she watched.

He wrapped both hands around the cup of wine, as though it were a chalice, and drank it down, eyes closed. He set the empty cup down and looked at Mrs. Wilson, curiously. I supposed he never had met one of his clients alive before, and wondered how long he had fulfilled this strange office.

Mrs. Wilson stared into his eyes, face blank as a childâ€™s. Her abdominal pulse was skipping like a stone, a few light beats, a pause, then a thump that struck my palm like a blow, and back to its erratic jumps.

The sin-eater bowed to her, very slowly. Then he turned round, and scampered for the door, with amazing speed for such an infirm specimen.

Several of the boys and younger men near the door rushed out after him, yelling; one or two seized sticks of wood from the fire basket by the hearth. Others were torn; they glanced toward the open door, where shouts and the thumps of thrown stones mingled with the wailing of the bean-treimâ€”but their eyes were drawn back ineluctably to Mrs. Wilson.

She looked . . . peaceful, was the only word. It was no surprise whatever to feel the pulse beneath my hand simply stop. Somewhere deeper, in my own depths, I felt the dizzying rush of the hemorrhage begin, a flooding warmth that pulled me into it, made black spots whirl before my eyes, and caused a ringing in my ears. I knew to all intents and purposes she had now died for good. I felt her go. And yet I heard her voice above the racket, very small but calm and clear.

â€œI forgive ye, Hiram,â€ she said. â€œYeâ€™ve been a good lad.â€

My vision had gone dark, but I could still hear and sense things dimly. Something grasped me, pulled me away, and a moment later I came to myself, leaning against Jamie in a corner, his arms supporting me.

â€œAre ye all right, Sassenach?â€ he was saying urgently, shaking me a little and patting my cheek.

The black-clad bean-treim had come as far as the door. I could see them outside, standing like twin pillars of darkness, falling snow beginning to whirl round them as the cold wind came inside, small hard dry flakes skittering and bouncing in its wake across the floor. The womenâ€™s voices rose and fell, blending with the wind. By the table, Hiram Crombie was trying to fix his mother-in-lawâ€™s garnet brooch to her shroud, though his hands shook and his narrow face was wet with tears.

â€œYes,â€ I said faintly, then â€œyesâ€ a little stronger. â€œEverything is all right now.â€





PART SIX




On the Mountain

BIRD-SPRING




March 1774

IT WAS SPRING, and the long months of desolation melted into running water, with streamlets pouring from every hill and miniature waterfalls leaping from stone to stone to stone.

The air was filled with the racket of birds, a cacophony of melody that replaced the lonely calling of geese passing by far overhead.

Birds go one by one in the winter, a single raven hunched brooding in a barren tree, an owl fluffed against the cold in the high, dark shadows of a barn. Or they go in flocks, a massed thunder of wings to bear them up and away, wheeling through the sky like handsful of pepper grains thrown aloft, calling their way in Vs of mournful courage toward the promise of a distant and problematic survival.

In winter, the raptors draw apart unto themselves; the songbirds flee away, all the color of the feathered world reduced to the brutal simplification of predator and prey, gray shadows passing overhead, with no more than a small bright drop of blood fallen back to earth here and there to mark the passing of life, leaving a drift of scattered feathers, borne on the wind.

But as spring blooms, the birds grow drunk with love and the bushes riot with their songs. Far, far into the night, darkness mutes but does not silence them, and small melodious conversations break out at all hours, invisible and strangely intimate in the dead of night, as though one overheard the lovemaking of strangers in the room next door.

I moved closer to Jamie, hearing the clear, sweet song of a thrush in the great red spruce that stood behind the house. It was still cold at night, but not with the bitter chill of winter; rather with the sweet fresh cold of thawing earth and springing leaves, a cold that sent the blood tingling and made warm bodies seek one another, nesting.

A rumbling snore echoed across the landingâ€”another harbinger of spring. Major MacDonald, who had arrived mud-caked and wind-bitten the night before, bringing unwelcome news of the outside world.

Jamie stirred briefly at the sound, groaned, farted briefly, and lay still. Heâ€™d stayed up late, entertaining the Majorâ€”if entertainment was the word for it.

I could hear Lizzie and Mrs. Bug in the kitchen below, talking as they banged pots and slammed doors in hopes of rousing us. Breakfast smells began to rise up the stairs, enticing, the bitter smell of roasting chicory spicing the thick warmth of buttered porridge.

The sound of Jamieâ€™s breathing had changed, and I knew he was awake, though he still lay with his eyes closed. I didnâ€™t know whether this denoted an urge to continue the physical pleasure of sleepâ€”or a marked disinclination to get up and deal with Major MacDonald.

He resolved this doubt at once by rolling over, enveloping me in his arms, and moving his lower body against mine in a manner that made it obvious that, while physical pleasure was what was on his mind, he was quite through sleeping.

He hadnâ€™t reached the point of coherent speech yet, though, and nuzzled my ear, making small interrogatory hums in his throat. Well, the Major was still asleep, and the coffeeâ€”such as it wasâ€”wouldnâ€™t be ready for a bit. I hummed back, reached to the bedside table for a bit of almond cream, and commenced a slow and pleasurable rummage through the layers of bedclothes and nightshirt to apply it.

Some small while later, snorts and thumps across the hall denoted the resurrection of Major MacDonald, and the delectable scents of frying ham and potatoes with onions had joined the throng of olfactory stimuli. The sweet smell of almond cream was stronger, though.

â€œGreased lightning,â€ Jamie said with a drowsy air of satisfaction. He was still in bed, lying on his side to watch me dress.

â€œWhat?â€ I turned from my looking glass to eye him. â€œWho?â€

â€œMe, I suppose. Or were ye not thunderstruck, there at the end?â€ He laughed, almost silently, rustling the bedclothes.

â€œOh, youâ€™ve been talking to Bree again,â€ I said tolerantly. I turned back to the glass. â€œThat particular figure of speech is a metaphor for extreme speed, not lubricated brilliance.â€

I smiled at him in the glass as I brushed knots out of my hair. He had unplaited it while I was anointing him, and subsequent exertions had caused it to explode. Come to think, it did faintly resemble the effects of electrocution.

â€œWell, I can be fast, too,â€ he said judiciously, sitting up and rubbing a hand through his own hair. â€œBut not first thing in the morning. There are worse ways to wake up, aye?â€

â€œYes, much worse.â€ Sounds of hawking and spitting came from across the landing, followed by the distinctive sound of someone with very vigorous bladder function employing a chamber pot. â€œIs he staying long, did he say?â€

Jamie shook his head. Rising slowly, he stretched himself like a cat and then came across in his shirt to put his arms around me. I hadnâ€™t yet poked up the fire, and the room was chilly; his body was pleasantly warm.

He rested his chin on top of my head, regarding our stacked reflections in the mirror.

â€œIâ€™ll have to go,â€ he said softly. â€œTomorrow, perhaps.â€

I stiffened a little, brush in hand.

â€œWhere? To the Indians?â€

He nodded, eyes on mine.

â€œMacDonald brought newspapers, wiâ€™ the text of letters from Governor Martin to various peopleâ€”Tryon in New York, General Gageâ€”asking help. Heâ€™s losing his grip upon the colonyâ€”insofar as he ever had oneâ€”and is seriously thinking of arming the Indians. Though that bit of information hasna made it into the newspapers, and a good thing, too.â€

He released me, and reached for the drawer where his clean shirts and stockings stayed.

â€œThat is a good thing,â€ I said, bundling back my hair and hunting for a ribbon to tie it with. Weâ€™d seen few newspapers through the winter, but even so, the level of disagreement between the Governor and the Assembly was clear; heâ€™d resorted to a practice of continuous proroguing, repeatedly dismissing the Assembly in order to prevent them passing legislation at odds with his desires.

I could well imagine what the public response would be to the revelation that he contemplated arming the Cherokee, Catawba, and Creek, and inciting them against his own people.

â€œIâ€™m guessing that he isnâ€™t actually going to do that,â€ I said, finding the blue ribbon I was looking for, â€œbecause if he hadâ€”does, I meanâ€”the Revolution would have got going in North Carolina right now, rather than in Massachusetts or Philadelphia two years from now. But why on earth is he publishing these letters in the newspaper?â€

Jamie laughed. He shook his head, pushing back the disheveled hair from his face.

â€œHeâ€™s not. Evidently, the Governorâ€™s mail is being intercepted. Heâ€™s no verra pleased about it, MacDonald says.â€

â€œI daresay not.â€ Mail was notoriously insecure, and always had been. In fact, we had originally acquired Fergus when Jamie hired him as a pickpocket, in order to steal letters in Paris. â€œHow is Fergus doing?â€ I asked.

Jamie made a small grimace, pulling on his stockings.

â€œBetter, I think. Marsali says heâ€™s staying more to home, which is good. And heâ€™s earning a wee bit, teaching French to Hiram Crombie. Butâ€”â€

â€œHiram? French?â€

â€œOh, aye.â€ He grinned at me. â€œHiramâ€™s set upon the idea that he must go and preach to the Indians, and he thinks heâ€™ll be best equipped to manage if heâ€™s got some French as well as English. Ianâ€™s teaching him a bit of the Tsalagi, too, but there are so many Indian tongues, heâ€™d never learn them all.â€

â€œWill wonders never cease,â€ I murmured. â€œDo you thinkâ€”â€

I was interrupted at this point by Mrs. Bug bellowing up the stairs, â€œIf Certain Persons are wantinâ€™ to let a good breakfast be spoilt, Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re welcome!â€

Like clockwork, Major MacDonaldâ€™s door popped open, and his feet clattered eagerly down the stairs.

â€œReady?â€ I said to Jamie. He seized my hairbrush and tidied himself with a few licks, then came to open the door and bowed, ushering me ceremoniously out.

â€œWhat ye said, Sassenach,â€ he said as he followed me down the stair. â€œAbout it starting in two years. Itâ€™s already well begun. Ye know that, aye?â€

â€œOh, yes,â€ I said, rather grimly. â€œBut I donâ€™t want to think about it on an empty stomach.â€



ROGER STOOD UP straight, measuring. The edge of the kiln pit he stood in came just under his chin. Six feet would be just about at eye level; only a few more inches, then. That was heartening. Setting the shovel against the dirt wall, he stooped, grabbed a wooden bucket full of earth, and heaved it up over the rim.

â€œDirt!â€ he yelled. There was no response to his shout. He rose on his toes, peering balefully round for his so-called assistants. Jemmy and Germain were meant to be taking it in turn to empty the buckets and pass them back down to him, but had a tendency to vanish abruptly.

â€œDirt!â€ he shouted as loudly as he could. The wee buggers couldnâ€™t have gone far; it took him less than two minutes to fill a bucket.

This call was answered, but not by the boys. A cold shadow fell over him, and he squinted up to see the silhouette of his father-in-law, stooping to grab the handle of the bucket. Jamie strode two paces and flung the dirt onto the slowly mounting heap, then came back, hopping down into the pit to return it.

â€œA tidy wee hole ye have here,â€ he said, turning round to survey it. â€œYe could barbecue an ox in it.â€

â€œIâ€™ll need one. Iâ€™m starving.â€ Roger wiped a sleeve across his forehead; the spring day was cool and crisp, but he was drenched with sweat.

Jamie had picked up his shovel and was examining the blade with interest.

â€œIâ€™ve never seen the like. Is it the lassâ€™s work?â€

â€œWith a bit of help from Dai Jones, aye.â€ It had taken roughly thirty secondsâ€™ work with an eighteenth-century shovel to convince Brianna that improvements could be made. It had taken three months to acquire a chunk of iron that could be shaped to her directions by the blacksmith and to persuade Dai Jonesâ€”who was Welsh and thus by definition stubbornâ€”into doing it. The normal spade was made of wood, and looked like nothing so much as a roof shingle attached to a pole.

â€œMay I try?â€ Enchanted, Jamie drove the pointed end of the new spade into the dirt at his feet.

â€œBe my guest.â€

Roger scrambled up out of the deep part of the pit into the shallower end of the kiln. Jamie stood in the part where the fire would go, according to Brianna, with a chimney to be raised over it. Items to be fired would sit in the longer, relatively shallow part of the pit and be covered over. After a week of shoveling, Roger was less inclined to think the distant possibility of plumbing was worth all the labor involved, but Bree wanted itâ€”and like her father, Bree was difficult to resist, though their methods varied.

Jamie shoveled briskly, tossing spadesful of dirt into the bucket, with small exclamations of delight and admiration at the ease and speed with which dirt could be dug. Despite his dim view of the occupation, Roger felt a sense of pride in his wifeâ€™s implement.

â€œFirst the wee matchsticks,â€ Jamie said, making a joke of it, â€œnow shovels. What will she think of next?â€

â€œIâ€™m afraid to ask,â€ Roger said, with a tinge of rue that made Jamie laugh.

The bucket filled, Roger picked it up and took it to empty, while Jamie filled the second. And without spoken agreement, they continued the job, Jamie digging, Roger carrying, finishing in what seemed no time at all.

Jamie climbed out of the pit and joined Roger on the edge, looking down at their handiwork in satisfaction.

â€œAnd if it doesna work well as a kiln,â€ Jamie observed, â€œshe can make a root cellar of it.â€

â€œWaste not, want not,â€ Roger agreed. They stood looking down into the hole, the breeze chilly through their damp shirts now that theyâ€™d stopped moving.

â€œDâ€™ye think ye might go back, you and the lass?â€ Jamie said. He spoke so casually that Roger missed his meaning at first, not catching on until he saw his father-in-lawâ€™s face, set in the imperturbable calm thatâ€”heâ€™d learned to his costâ€”generally covered some strong emotion.

â€œBack,â€ he repeated uncertainly. Surely he didnâ€™t meanâ€”but of course he did. â€œThrough the stones, do you mean?â€

Jamie nodded, seeming to find some fascination in the walls of the pit, where drying grass rootlets hung in tangles, and the jagged edges of stones protruded from the patchy damp dirt.

â€œIâ€™ve thought of it,â€ Roger said, after a pause. â€œWeâ€™ve thought. But . . .â€ He let his voice trail off, finding no good way to explain.

Jamie nodded again, though, as if he had. He supposed Jamie and Claire must have discussed it, even as he and Bree had, playing over the pros and cons. The dangers of the passageâ€”and he did not underestimate those dangers, the more so in light of what Claire had told him about Donner and his comrades; what if he made it throughâ€”and Bree and Jem didnâ€™t? It didnâ€™t bear thinking.

Beyond that, if they all survived the passage, was the pain of separationâ€”and he would admit that it would be painful for him, as well. Whatever its limitations or inconveniences, the Ridge was home.

Against those considerations, though, stood the dangers of the present time, for the four horsemen of the apocalypse rode widely here; it was no trick to catch a glimpse of pestilence or famine from the corner of your eye. And the pale horse and its rider were inclined to show up unexpectedlyâ€”and often.

But thatâ€™s what Jamie meant, of course, he realized belatedly.

â€œBecause of the war, ye mean.â€

â€œThe Oâ€™Brians,â€ Jamie said quietly. â€œThat will happen again, ken? Many times.â€

It was spring now, not autumn, but the cold wind that touched his bones was the same as the one that had blown brown and golden leaves across the face of the little girl. Roger had a sudden vision of the two of them, Jamie and himself, standing now at the edge of this cavernous hole, like bedraggled mourners at a graveside. He turned his back on the pit, looking instead into the budding green of the chestnut trees.

â€œYe know,â€ he said, after a momentâ€™s silence, â€œwhen I first learned whatâ€”what Claire is, what we are, all about itâ€”I thought, â€˜How fascinating!â€™ To actually see history in the making, I mean. In all honesty, I maybe came as much for that as for Bree. Then, I mean.â€

Jamie laughed shortly, turning round as well.

â€œOh, aye, and is it? Fascinating?â€

â€œMore than I ever thought,â€ Roger assured him, with extreme dryness. â€œBut why are ye asking now? I told ye a year ago that weâ€™d stay.â€

Jamie nodded, pursing his lips.

â€œYe did. The thing isâ€”I am thinking I must sell one or more of the gemstones.â€

That brought Roger up a bit. Heâ€™d not consciously thought it, of courseâ€”but the knowledge that the gems were there, in case of need . . . He hadnâ€™t realized what a sense of security that knowledge had held, until this moment.

â€œTheyâ€™re yours to sell,â€ he replied, cautious. â€œWhy now, though? Are things difficult?â€

Jamie gave him an exceedingly wry look.

â€œDifficult,â€ he repeated. â€œAye, ye could say that.â€ And proceeded to lay out the situation succinctly.

The marauders had destroyed not only a seasonâ€™s whisky in the making, but also the malting shed, only now rebuilding. That meant no surplus of the lovely drink this year to sell or trade for necessities. There were twenty-two more tenant families on the Ridge to be mindful of, most of them struggling with a place and a profession that they could never have imagined, trying merely to keep alive long enough to learn how to stay that way.

â€œAnd then,â€ Jamie added grimly, â€œthereâ€™s MacDonaldâ€”speak oâ€™ the devil.â€

The Major himself had come out onto the stoop, his red coat bright in the morning sun. He was dressed for travel, Roger saw, booted and spurred, and wearing his wig, laced hat in hand.

â€œA flying visit, I see.â€

Jamie made a small, uncouth noise.

â€œLong enough to tell me I must try to arrange the purchase of thirty muskets, with shot and powderâ€”at my own expense, mindâ€”to be repaid by the Crown, eventually,â€ he added, in a cynic tone that made it obvious how remote he considered this eventuality to be.

â€œThirty muskets.â€ Roger contemplated that, pursing his own lips in a soundless whistle. Jamie had not been able even to afford to replace the rifle he had given Bird for his help in the matter of Brownsville.

Jamie shrugged.

â€œAnd then there are wee matters like the dowry Iâ€™ve promised Lizzie Wemyssâ€”sheâ€™ll be wed this summer. And Marsaliâ€™s mother, Laoghaireâ€”â€ He glanced warily at Roger, unsure how much he might know regarding Laoghaire. More than Jamie would be comfortable knowing, Roger thought, and tactfully kept his face blank.

â€œI owe a bit to her, for maintenance. We can live, aye, with what weâ€™ve gotâ€”but for the rest . . . I must sell land, or the stones. And I willna give up the land.â€ His fingers drummed restlessly against his thigh, then stopped, as he raised his hand to wave to the Major, who had just spotted them across the clearing.

â€œI see. Well, then . . .â€ Plainly, it had to be done; it was foolish to sit on a fortune in gems, merely because they might one day be needed for a far-fetched and risky purpose. Still, the notion made Roger feel slightly hollow, like rappelling down a cliff and having someone cut your safety line.

Jamie blew out his breath.

â€œWell, so. Iâ€™ll send one wiâ€™ Bobby Higgins to his Lordship in Virginia. Heâ€™ll get me a good price, at least.â€

â€œAye, thatâ€™s aâ€”â€ Roger halted, his attention deflected by the scenario unfolding before him.

The Major, obviously well-breakfasted and cheerful, had come down the steps and was strolling toward themâ€”oblivious of the white sow, who had emerged from her den beneath the foundation and was ambling along the side of the house, bent on her own breakfast. It would be a matter of seconds before she spotted the Major.

â€œHoy!â€ Roger bellowed, and felt something tear in his throat. The pain was so sharp that it stopped him cold, and he clutched at his throat, struck suddenly mute.

â€œâ€™Ware the pig!â€ Jamie was shouting, waving and pointing. The Major thrust his head forward, hand behind his earâ€”then caught the repeated bellows of â€œPig!â€ and looked wildly round, just in time to see the white sow break into a ponderous trot, scything her tusks from side to side.

He would have been best served by wheeling and sprinting back to the safety of the stoop, but instead panic struck him and he ranâ€”away from the pig, coming straight for Jamie and Roger, who promptly ran in different directions.

Glancing back, Roger saw the Major gaining on the pig with long-legged leaps, his goal evidently the cabin. Between the Major and the cabin, though, lay the open hole of the groundhog kiln, masked by the heavy growth of long spring grass through which the Major bounded.

â€œPit!â€ Roger shouted, only the word came out in a strangled croak. Nonetheless, MacDonald seemed to hear him, for a bright red face turned in his direction, eyes bulging. It must have sounded like â€œPig!â€ for the Major glanced back over his shoulder then to see the sow trot faster, small pink eyes fixed on him with murderous intent.

The distraction proved nearly fatal, for the Majorâ€™s spurs caught and tangled, and he sprawled headlong in the grass, losing his grip on the laced hatâ€”which he had held throughout the chaseâ€”and sending it pinwheeling through the air.

Roger hesitated for an instant, but then ran back to help, with a smothered oath. He saw Jamie running back, too, spade held at the readyâ€”though even a metal shovel seemed pitifully inadequate to deal with a five-hundred-pound hog.

MacDonald was already scrambling to his feet, though; before either of them could reach him, he took off running as though the devil himself were breathing on his coattails. Arms pumping and face set in puce determination, he ran for his life, bounding like a jackrabbit through the grassâ€”and disappeared. One instant he was there, and the next he had vanished, as though by magic.

Jamie looked wide-eyed at Roger, then at the pig, who had stopped short on the far side of the kiln pit. Then, moving gingerly, one eye always on the pig, he sidled toward the pit, glancing sideways, as though afraid to see what lay at the bottom.

Roger moved to stand at Jamieâ€™s shoulder, looking down. Major MacDonald had fallen into the deeper hole at the end, where he lay curled up like a hedgehog, arms clasped protectively over his wigâ€”which had remained in place by some miracle, though now much bespattered with dirt and bits of grass.

â€œMacDonald?â€ Jamie called down. â€œAre ye damaged, man?â€

â€œIs she there?â€ quavered the Major, not emerging from his ball.

Roger glanced across the pit at the pig, now some distance away, snout down in the long grass.

â€œEr . . . aye, she is.â€ To his surprise, his voice came easy, if a little hoarse. He cleared his throat and spoke a little louder. â€œYe needna worry, though. Sheâ€™s busy eating your hat.â€

THE GUN-SMITH




JAMIE ACCOMPANIED MacDonald as far as Coopersville, where he set the Major on the road back to Salisbury, equipped with food, a disreputable slouched hat against the weather, and a small bottle of whisky to fortify his bruised spirits. Then, with an internal sigh, he turned into the McGillivraysâ€™ place.

Robin was at work in his forge, surrounded by the smells of hot metal, wood shavings, and gun oil. A lanky young man with a hatchet face was working the leather bellows, though his dreamy expression showed a certain lack of attention to the job.

Robin caught the shadow of Jamieâ€™s entrance and glanced up, gave a quick nod, and returned to his work.

He was hammering bar iron into flat bands; the iron cylinder he meant to wrap them round to form a gun barrel was waiting, propped between two blocks. Jamie moved carefully out of range of flying sparks and sat down on a bucket to wait.

That was Sengaâ€™s betrothed at the bellows . . . Heinrich. Heinrich Strasse. He picked the name unerringly out of the hundreds he carried in his mind, and along with it came automatically all he knew of young Heinrichâ€™s history, family, and connections, these appearing in his imagination round the boyâ€™s long, dreamy face in a constellation of social affinities, orderly and complex as the pattern of a snowflake.

He always saw people in this way, but seldom thought of it consciously. There was something about the shape of Strasseâ€™s face, though, that reinforced the mental imageryâ€”the long axis of forehead, nose, and chin, emphasized by a horsey upper lip, deeply grooved, the horizontal axis shorter, but no less sharply defined by long, narrow eyes and flat dark brows above them.

He could see the boyâ€™s originsâ€”the middle of nine children, but the eldest boy, son of an overbearing father and a mother who dealt with this by means of subterfuge and quiet maliceâ€”sprouting in a delicate array from the rather pointed top of his head, his religionâ€”Lutheran, but slack about itâ€”a lacy spray under an equally pointed chin, his relation with Robinâ€”cordial, but wary, as befitted a new son-in-law who was also an apprenticeâ€”extending like a fanned spike from his right ear, that with Uteâ€”a mix of terror and helpless abashmentâ€”from the left.

This notion entertained him very much, and he was obliged to look away, affecting interest in Robinâ€™s workbench, in order to keep from staring and rendering the lad uncomfortable.

The gunsmith was not tidy; scraps of wood and metal lay among a jumble of spikes, scribes, hammers, blocks of wood, bits of filthy garnet cloth and sticks of charcoal on the bench. A few papers were weighted down with a spoiled gunstock that had split in the making, their dirty edges fluttering in the hot breath of the forge. He would have taken no notice, save that he recognized the style of the drawing, would have known that boldness and delicacy of line anywhere.

Frowning, he rose and pulled the papers from under the gunstock. Drawings of a gun, executed from different anglesâ€”a rifle, there was the cutaway interior of the barrel, the grooves and landings clearâ€”but most peculiar. One drawing showed it whole, reasonably familiar, bar the odd hornlike growths on the barrel. But the next . . . the gun seemed as though someone had broken it over his knee; it was snapped through, stock and barrel pointing downward in opposite directions, joined only by . . . what sort of hinge was that? He closed one eye, considering.

The cessation of clamor from the forge and the loud hiss of hot metal in the sump broke his fascination with the drawings and made him look up.

â€œDid your lass show ye those?â€ Robin asked, with a nod at the papers. He pulled the tail of his shirt up from behind his leather apron, and mopped steam from his sweating face, looking amused.

â€œNo. What is she about? Is she wanting ye to make her a gun?â€ He relinquished the sheets to the gunsmith, who shuffled through them, sniffing with interest.

â€œOh, sheâ€™s no way of paying for that, Mac Dubh, unless Roger Macâ€™s discovered a pot oâ€™ fairy gold since last week. No, sheâ€™s only been telling me her notions of improvement in the art of riflery, asking what it might cost to make such a thing.â€ The cynic smile that had been lurking in the corner of Robinâ€™s mouth broadened into a grin, and he shoved the papers back at Jamie. â€œI can tell sheâ€™s yours, Mac Dubh. What other lass would spend her time thinking of guns, rather than gowns and bairns?â€

There was more than a little implied criticism in this remarkâ€”Brianna had undoubtedly been a good deal more forthright in manner than was becomingâ€”but he let it pass for the moment. He needed Robinâ€™s goodwill.

â€œWell, any woman has her fancies,â€ he observed mildly. â€œEven wee Lizzie, I supposeâ€”but Manfred will see to that, Iâ€™m sure. Heâ€™ll be in Salisbury just now? Or Hillsboro?â€

Robin McGillivray was by no means a stupid man. The abrupt transition of subject made him arch one brow, but he passed no remark. Instead, he sent Heinrich off to the house to fetch them some beer, waiting for the lad to disappear before turning back to Jamie, expectant.

â€œI need thirty muskets, Robin,â€ he said without preamble. â€œAnd Iâ€™ll need them quicklyâ€”within three months.â€

The gunsmithâ€™s face went comically blank with astonishment, but only for a moment. He blinked then, and closed his mouth with a snap, resuming his usual expression of sardonic good humor.

â€œStarting your own army, are ye, Mac Dubh?â€

Jamie merely smiled at that without answering. If word got around that he meant to arm his tenantry and muster his own Committee of Safety in answer to Richard Brownâ€™s banditry, that would do nay harm and might do good. Letting word get out that the Governor was working secretly to arm the savages, in case he required to suppress an armed rising in the backcountry, and that he, Jamie Fraser, was the agent of such actionâ€”that was an excellent way to get himself killed and his house burnt to the ground, to say nothing of what other trouble might ensue.

â€œHow many can ye find for me, Robin? And how fast?â€

The gunsmith squinted, thinking, then darted a sideways glance at him.

â€œCash?â€

He nodded, seeing Robinâ€™s lips purse in a soundless whistle of astonishment. Robin kent as well as anyone that he had no money to speak ofâ€”let alone the small fortune required to assemble that many guns.

He could see the speculation in Robinâ€™s eyes, as to where he might be planning to acquire that sort of moneyâ€”but the gunsmith said nothing aloud. McGillivrayâ€™s upper teeth sank into his lower lip in concentration, then relaxed.

â€œI can find six, maybe seven, betwixt Salisbury and Salem. Bruggeâ€â€”naming the Moravian gunsmithâ€”â€œwould do one or two, if he kent it was for you. . . .â€ Seeing the infinitesimal shake of Jamieâ€™s head he nodded in resignation. â€œAye, well, maybe seven, then. And Manfred and I can manage maybe three moreâ€”itâ€™s only muskets youâ€™re wanting, nothing fancy?â€ He tilted his head toward Briannaâ€™s drawing with a small flash of his earlier humor.

â€œNothing fancy,â€ Jamie said, smiling. â€œThatâ€™s ten, then.â€ He waited. Robin sighed, settling himself.

â€œIâ€™ll ask about,â€ he said. â€œBut itâ€™s no an easy matter. Particularly if ye dinna mean your name to be heard in connectionâ€”and I gather ye donâ€™t.â€

â€œYeâ€™re a man oâ€™ rare wit and discretion, Robin,â€ Jamie assured him gravely, making him laugh. It was true, for all that; Robin McGillivray had fought beside him at Culloden, lived three years with him in Ardsmuir; Jamie would trust him with his lifeâ€”and was. He began to wish the pig had eaten MacDonald after all, but put the unworthy thought from his mind and drank the beer Heinrich brought, chatting of inconsequence and trivia until it was polite to take his leave.

He had ridden Gideon, to bear MacDonald company on his horse, but meant to leave him in Dai Jonesâ€™s barn. Through a complex bit of bargaining, Gideon would cover John Woolamâ€™s spotted mareâ€”to be brought up when Woolam returned from Bear Creekâ€”and when the harvest was in come autumn, Jamie would collect a hundredweight of barley, with a bottle of whisky to Dai for his assistance.

Exchanging a bit of conversation with Daiâ€”he could never decide whether the blacksmith was truly a man of few words, or was it only that he despaired of making the Scots understand his Welsh singsongâ€”Jamie slapped Gideon encouragingly on the neck and left him to eat grain and fettle his loins against the coming of the spotted mare.

Dai had offered him food, but he declined; he was peckish, but looked forward to the peace of the five-mile walk home. The day was fine and pale blue, with the spring leaves murmuring to themselves overhead, and a bit of solitude would be welcome.

The decision had been made when he asked Robin to find him guns. But the situation bore thought.

There were sixty-four villages of the Cherokee; each with its own headman, its own peace chief and war chief. Only five of those villages were within his power to influenceâ€”the three villages of the Snowbird people, and two that belonged to the Overhill Cherokee. Those, he thought, would follow the leaders of the Overhill, regardless of his words.

Roger Mac had known relatively little of the Cherokee, or what their role might be in the looming fight. He had been able to say only that the Cherokee had not acted en masse; some villages chose to fight, some did notâ€”some fought for one side, some for another.

Well, so. It was not likely that anything he said or did would turn the tide of war, and that was a comfort. But he could not escape the knowledge that his own time to jump was coming. So far as anyone knew now, he was a loyal subject to His Majesty, a Tory beavering away in Geordieâ€™s interest, suborning savages and distributing guns with an eye to suppressing the riotous passions of Regulators, Whigs, and would-be republicans.

At some point, this facade must necessarily crumble to reveal him as a dyed-in-the-wool rebel and a traitor. But when? He wondered idly whether he might have a price on his head this time, and how much it would be.

It might be not so difficult, with the Scots. Grudge-bearing and hardheaded as they were, he was one of them, and personal liking might moderate the sense of outrage at his turning rebel, when the time came.

No, it was the Indians he worried overâ€”for he came to them as the agent of the King. How suddenly to explain his change of heart? And further, do it in such a way that they might share it? Surely they would see this as treachery at worst, grossly suspicious behavior at best. He thought they would not kill him, but how in Godâ€™s name to induce them to fall in with the cause of rebellion, when they enjoyed a stable and prosperous relation with His Majesty?

Oh, God, and there was John. What could he say to his friend, when the time came? Convince him by logic and rhetoric to change his coat as well? He hissed through his teeth and shook his head in consternation, tryingâ€”and failing utterlyâ€”to envision John Grey, lifelong soldier, ex-Royal Governor, that very soul of loyalty and honor, suddenly declaring himself for rebellion and republic.

He passed on, fretting in this fashion for some time, but gradually found the walking soothe his mind, and the peace of the day lighten his heart. There would be time before supper to take wee Jem fishing, he thought; the sun was bright, but there was a certain dampness to the air under the trees that was promising for a first hatch of flies on the water. He had a feeling in his bones that the trout would rise near sunset.

In this more pleasant frame of mind, he was glad to meet his daughter, some little way below the Ridge. His heart lifted at sight of her hair, streaming wanton down her back in ruddy glory.

â€œCiamar a tha thu, a nighean?â€ he said, kissing her cheek in greeting.

â€œTha mi gu math, mo athair,â€ she said, and she smiled, but he noted a small frown that troubled the smooth flesh of her forehead like the hatch of mayfly on a trout pond.

â€œIâ€™ve been waiting for you,â€ she said, taking his arm. â€œI wanted to talk to you before you go to the Indians tomorrow.â€ And there was that in her tone that drove all thought of fish from his mind upon the instant.

â€œOh, aye?â€

She nodded, but seemed to have some difficulty in finding wordsâ€”an occurrence that alarmed him still further. But he could not help her, without some notion what it was about, and so kept pace with her, silent but encouraging. A mockingbird was busy nearby, practicing its repertoire of calls. It was the bird who lived in the red spruce behind the house; he knew because it paused now and then in the midst of its chatter and trilling to give a fine imitation of Adso the catâ€™s midnight yowl.

â€œWhen you talked to Roger about the Indians,â€ Brianna said finally, and turned her head to look at him, â€œdid he mention something called the Trail of Tears?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, curious. â€œWhat is that?â€

She grimaced, hunching her shoulders in a way that seemed disconcertingly familiar.

â€œI thought maybe he hadnâ€™t. He said heâ€™d told you all he knew about the Indians and the Revolutionâ€”not that he knows all that much, it wasnâ€™t his specialtyâ€”but this happenedâ€”will happen later, after the Revolution. So he maybe didnâ€™t think it was important. Maybe itâ€™s not.â€

She hesitated, as though wanting him to tell her that it wasnâ€™t. He only waited, though, and she sighed, looking at her feet as she paced along. She was wearing sandals without stockings, and her long, bare toes were grimed with the soft dust of the wagon road. The sight of her feet always filled him with an odd mixture of pride at their elegant shape and a faint sense of shame at their sizeâ€”but as he was responsible for both, he supposed he had no grounds for complaint.

â€œAbout sixty years from now,â€ she said at last, eyes on the ground, â€œthe American government will take the Cherokee from their land and move them. A long wayâ€”to a place called Oklahoma. Itâ€™s a thousand miles, at least, and hundreds and hundreds of them will starve and die on the way. Thatâ€™s why they called itâ€”will call itâ€”the Trail of Tears.â€

He was impressed to hear that there should be a government capable of doing such a thing, and said so. She shot him an angry glance.

â€œTheyâ€™ll do it by cheating. Theyâ€™ll talk some of the Cherokee leaders into agreeing by promising them things and not keeping their bargain.â€

He shrugged.

â€œThatâ€™s how most governments behave,â€ he observed mildly. â€œWhy are ye telling me this, lass? I willâ€”thank Godâ€”be safely dead before any of it happens.â€

He saw a flicker cross her face at mention of his death, and was sorry to have caused her distress by his levity. Before he could apologize, though, she squared her shoulders and went on.

â€œIâ€™m telling you because I thought you should know,â€ she said. â€œNot all of the Cherokee wentâ€”some of them went farther up into the mountains and hid; the army didnâ€™t find them.â€

â€œAye?â€

She turned her head and gave him a look from those eyes that were his own, touching in their earnestness.

â€œDonâ€™t you see? Mama told you what would happenâ€”about Culloden. You couldnâ€™t stop it, but you saved Lallybroch. And your men, your tenants. Because you knew.â€

â€œOh, Christ,â€ he said, realizing with a shock what she meant. Recollection washed through him in a flood, the terror and desperation and uncertainty of that timeâ€”the numb despair that had carried him through that last fatal day. â€œYe want me to tell Bird.â€

She rubbed a hand over her face, and shook her head.

â€œI donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know if you should tell himâ€”or if you do, whether heâ€™ll listen. But Roger and I talked about it, after you asked him about the Indians. And I kept thinking about it . . . and, well, it just didnâ€™t seem right, to know and not do anything. So I thought Iâ€™d better tell you.â€

â€œAye, I see,â€ he said a little bleakly.

He had noticed before the inclination of persons with tender consciences to ease their discomfort by handing the necessity of taking action on to someone else, but forbore to mention it. She could hardly be telling Bird herself, after all.

As though the situation he faced with the Cherokee were not sufficiently difficult already, he thought wrylyâ€”now he must deal with saving unknown future generations of savages? The mockingbird zoomed past his ear, unnervingly close, clucking like a hen, of all things.

It was so incongruous that he laughed. And then realized that there was nothing else to do. Not now.

Brianna was looking at him curiously.

â€œWhat are you going to do?â€

He stretched himself, slowly, luxuriously, feeling the muscles of his back pull upon his bones, feeling each of them, alive and solid. The sun was coming down the sky, supper was beginning to cook, and for now, for this one last night, he need do nothing. Not yet.

â€œIâ€™m going fishing,â€ he said, smiling at his lovely, unlikely, problematical daughter. â€œFetch the wee lad, aye? Iâ€™ll get the poles.â€



James Fraser, Esq. from Fraserâ€™s Ridge

To my Lord John Grey, Mount Josiah Plantation,

this 2nd day of April, Anno Domini 1774

My lord,

I depart in the morning to visit the Cherokee, and so leave this with my wife, to be entrusted to Mr. Higgins when he shall next arrive, to be delivered with its accompanying parcel into your hands.

I presume upon your kindness and your solicitude for my family in asking your favor to help in selling the object I entrust to you. I suspect that your connexions might enable you to obtain a better price than I might do myselfâ€”and to do so discreetly.

I shall hope upon my return to confide in you the reasons for my action, as well as certain philosophical reflections which you may find of interest. In the meantime, believe me ever





Your most affectionate friend and humble servant,





J. Fraser

DRESS REHEARSAL




BOBBY HIGGINS looked uneasily at me over his mug of beer.

â€œBeg pardon, mum,â€ he said. â€œBut you wouldnâ€™t be a-thinking of practicing some type of physic upon me, would you? The worms are gone, Iâ€™m sure of it. And theâ€”the otherâ€â€”he blushed slightly and squirmed upon the benchâ€”â€œthatâ€™s quite all right, too. Iâ€™ve et so many beans, I fart quite regular, and not a touch of the fiery knives about it!â€

Jamie had frequently remarked upon the transparency of my features, but this was surprising perspicacity on Bobbyâ€™s part.

â€œIâ€™m thrilled to hear it,â€ I said, evading his question momentarily. â€œYou look quite in the pink of health, Bobby.â€

He did; the hollow, wasted look had left him, and his flesh was firm and solid, his eyes bright. The blind one hadnâ€™t gone milky, nor did it wander perceptibly; he must have some residual ability to detect light and shape, which strengthened my original diagnosis of a partially detached retina.

He nodded warily, and took a sip of beer, still keeping his eyes fixed on me.

â€œIâ€™m very well indeed, mum,â€ he said.

â€œSplendid. You donâ€™t happen to know how much you weigh, do you, Bobby?â€

The look of wariness vanished, replaced by modest pride.

â€œHappen I do, mum. I took some fleeces to the river port for his Lordship last month, and was a mercer there what had a scale for weighing outâ€”tobacco or rice, or blocks of indigo as it might be. Some of us fellows got to wagering for sport what this or that might weigh, and . . . well, ten stone four it is, mum.â€

â€œVery nice,â€ I said with approval. â€œLord Johnâ€™s cook must be feeding you well.â€ I thought he couldnâ€™t have weighed more than a hundred and ten pounds when I first saw him; a hundred and forty-four was still on the light side for a man of nearly six feet, but it was a major improvement. And a real stroke of luck, that he should have known his weight exactly.

Of course, if I didnâ€™t act fast, he might easily gain a stone or two; Mrs. Bug had set herself to outdo Lord Johnâ€™s Indian cook (of whom we had heard much), and to this end was shoveling eggs, onions, venison, and a slice of leftover pork pie onto Bobbyâ€™s plate, to say nothing of the basket of fragrant muffins already in front of him.

Lizzie, seated beside me, took one of these and spread it with butter. I noted with approval that she, too, was looking healthier, delicately flushedâ€”though I must remember to take a sample to check the malarial parasites in her blood. That would be an excellent thing to do while she was out. No way of getting an exact weight for her, unfortunatelyâ€”but she couldnâ€™t weigh more than seven stone, small and light-boned as she was.

Now, Bree and Roger at the other end of the scale . . . Roger had to weigh at least a hundred and eighty-five; Bree probably one-fifty. I took a muffin myself, thinking how best to bring up my plan. Roger would do it if I asked, of course, but Bree . . . Iâ€™d have to be careful there. Sheâ€™d had her tonsils out under ether at the age of ten, and hadnâ€™t liked the experience. If she found out what I was up to and began expressing her opinions freely, she might arouse alarm in the rest of my guinea pigs.

Enthused by my success at making ether, I had seriously underestimated the difficulty of inducing anyone to let me use it on them. Mr. Christie might well be an awkward bugger, as Jamie on occasion called himâ€”but he was not alone in his resistance to the notion of being rendered suddenly unconscious.

I would have thought that the appeal of painlessness was universalâ€”but not to people who had never experienced it. They had no context in which to place such a notion, and while they presumably didnâ€™t all think ether was a Papist plot, they did view an offer to remove pain from them as being in some way contrary to the divine vision of the universe.

Bobby and Lizzie, though, were sufficiently under my sway that I was fairly sure I could coaxâ€”or bullyâ€”them into a brief trial. If they then reported the experience in a positive light . . . but improved public relations was only the half of it.

The real necessity was to try my ether out on a variety of subjects, taking careful note of the results. The scare of Henri-Christianâ€™s birth had shown me how woefully unprepared I was. I needed to have some idea of how much to administer per unit of body weight, how long such-and-such a dose might last, and how deep the resulting stupor might be. The last thing I wanted was to be up to my elbows in someoneâ€™s abdomen, only to have them come suddenly round with a shriek.

â€œYouâ€™re doing it again, mum.â€ Bobbyâ€™s brow creased as he chewed slowly, eyes narrowed at me.

â€œWhat? What am I doing?â€ I feigned innocence, helping myself to a bit of the pork pie.

â€œWatching me. Same as a sparrer hawk watches a mouse, just afore she stoops. Iâ€™nâ€™t she?â€ he appealed to Lizzie.

â€œAye, she is,â€ Lizzie agreed, dimpling at me. â€œBut itâ€™s only her way, ken. Yeâ€™d make a big mouse, Bobby.â€ Being Scottish, she pronounced it â€œmoose,â€ which made Bobby laugh and choke over his muffin.

Mrs. Bug paused to pound him helpfully on the back, leaving him purple and gasping.

â€œWell, whaâ€™s amiss wiâ€™ him, then?â€ she asked, coming round to squint critically at Bobbyâ€™s face. â€œYeâ€™ve no got the shits again, have ye, lad?â€

â€œAgain?â€ I said.

â€œOh, no, mum,â€ he croaked. â€œPerish the thought! â€™Twas only eating green apples, the once.â€ He choked, coughed, and sat up straight, clearing his throat.

â€œCan we please not talk about me bowels, mum?â€ he asked plaintively. â€œNot over breakfast, at least?â€

I could feel Lizzie vibrating with amusement next to me, but she kept her eyes demurely on her plate, not to embarrass him further.

â€œCertainly,â€ I said, smiling. â€œI hope youâ€™ll be staying for a few days, Bobby?â€ Heâ€™d come the day before, bearing the usual assortment of letters and newspapers from Lord Johnâ€”along with a package containing a marvelous present for Jemmy: a musical jack-in-the-box, sent specially from London by the good offices of Lord Johnâ€™s son, Willie.

â€œOh, I sâ€™all, mum, yes,â€ he assured me, mouth full of muffin. â€œHis Lordship said I was to see if Mr. Fraser had a letter for me to carry back, so I must wait for him, mustnâ€™t I?â€

â€œOf course.â€ Jamie and Ian had gone to the Cherokee a week before; it was likely to be another week before they returned. Plenty of time to make my experiments.

â€œIs there anything I might do, mum, in the way of service to you?â€ Bobby asked. â€œSeeing as Iâ€™m here, I mean, and Mr. Fraser and Mr. Ian not.â€ There was a small tone of satisfaction in this; he got on all right with Ian, but there was no doubt that he preferred to have Lizzieâ€™s attention to himself.

â€œWhy, yes,â€ I said, scooping up a bit of porridge. â€œNow that you mention it, Bobby . . .â€

By the time I had finished explaining, Bobby still looked healthy, but a good deal less in bloom.

â€œPut me asleep,â€ he repeated uncertainly. He glanced at Lizzie, who looked a little uncertain, too, but who was much too used to being told to do unreasonable things to protest.

â€œYouâ€™ll only be asleep for a moment,â€ I assured him. â€œLikely you wonâ€™t even notice.â€

His face expressed considerable skepticism, and I could see him shifting about for some excuse. Iâ€™d foreseen that ploy, though, and now played my trump card.

â€œItâ€™s not only me needing to judge the dose,â€ I said. â€œI canâ€™t operate on someone and give the ether at the same timeâ€”or not easily. Malva Christie will be assisting me; sheâ€™ll need the practice.â€

â€œOh,â€ Bobby said thoughtfully. â€œMiss Christie.â€ A sort of soft, dreamy expression spread across his face. â€œWell. I sâ€™ouldnâ€™t want to put Miss Christie out, of course.â€

Lizzie made one of those economical Scottish noises in the back of her throat, managing to convey scorn, derision, and abiding disapproval in the space of two glottal syllables.

Bobby looked up in inquiry, a bit of pie poised on his fork.

â€œDid you say something?â€

â€œWho, me?â€ she said. â€œOâ€™ course not.â€ She got up abruptly and, carrying her apron before her, neatly shook crumbs into the fire, and turned to me.

â€œWhen dâ€™ye mean to do it?â€ she demanded, adding a belated, â€œmaâ€™am.â€

â€œTomorrow morning,â€ I said. â€œIt needs to be done on an empty stomach, so weâ€™ll do it first thing, before breakfast.â€

â€œFine!â€ she said, and stamped out.

Bobby blinked after her, then turned to me, bewildered.

â€œDid I say something?â€

Mrs. Bugâ€™s eye met mine in perfect understanding.

â€œNot a thing, lad,â€ she said, depositing a fresh spatulaful of scrambled eggs onto his plate. â€œEat up. Yeâ€™ll need your strength.â€



BRIANNA, CLEVER WITH her hands, had made the mask to my specifications, woven of oak splits. It was simple enough, a sort of double cage, hinged so that the two halves of it swung apart for the insertion of a thick layer of cotton wool between them, and then back together, the whole thing shaped to fit like a catcherâ€™s mask over the patientâ€™s nose and mouth.

â€œPut enough ether on to dampen the cotton wool all through,â€ I instructed Malva. â€œWeâ€™ll want it to take effect quickly.â€

â€œAye, maâ€™am. Oh, it does smell queer, doesnâ€™t it?â€ She sniffed cautiously, face turned half away as she dripped ether onto the mask.

â€œYes. Do be careful not to breathe too much of it yourself,â€ I said. â€œWe donâ€™t want you falling over in the midst of an operation.â€

She laughed, but dutifully held the mask further away.

Lizzie had bravely offered to go firstâ€”with the clear intent of deflecting Bobbyâ€™s attention from Malva to her. This was working; she lay in a languid pose on the table, cap off, and her soft, pale hair displayed to best advantage on the pillow. Bobby sat beside her, earnestly holding her hand.

â€œAll right, then.â€ I had a tiny minute-glass to hand, the best I could do by way of keeping accurate time. â€œPut it gently over her face. Lizzie, just breathe deeply, and count with me, one . . . two . . . goodness, that didnâ€™t take long, did it?â€

Sheâ€™d taken one long breath, rib cage rising highâ€”and then gone limp as a dead flounder as the breath went out. I hastily flipped the glass, and came to take her pulse. All well there.

â€œWait for a bit; you can feel it, when they start to come round, a sort of vibration in the flesh,â€ I instructed Malva, keeping one eye on Lizzie and the other on the glass. â€œPut your hand on her shoulder. . . . There, do you feel it?â€

Malva nodded, nearly trembling with excitement.

â€œTwo or three drops then.â€ She added these, her own breath held, and Lizzie relaxed again with a sigh like an escape of air from a punctured tire.

Bobbyâ€™s blue eyes were absolutely round, but he clung fiercely to Lizzieâ€™s other hand.

I timed the period to arousal once or twice more, then let Malva put her under a little more deeply. I picked up the lancet I had ready, and pricked Lizzieâ€™s finger. Bobby gasped as the blood welled up, looking back and forth from the crimson drop to Lizzieâ€™s angelically peaceful face.

â€œWhy, she donâ€™t feel it!â€ he exclaimed. â€œLook, sheâ€™s never moved a muscle!â€

â€œExactly,â€ I said, with a profound feeling of satisfaction. â€œShe wonâ€™t feel anything at all, until she comes round.â€

â€œMrs. Fraser says we could cut someone quite open,â€ Malva informed Bobby, self-importantly. â€œSlice into them, and get at whatâ€™s ailingâ€”and theyâ€™d never feel a thing!â€

â€œWell, not until they woke up,â€ I said, amused. â€œTheyâ€™d feel it then, Iâ€™m afraid. But it really is quite a marvelous thing,â€ I added more softly, looking down at Lizzieâ€™s unconscious face.

I let her stay under whilst I checked the fresh blood sample, then told Malva to take the mask off. Within a minute, Lizzieâ€™s eyelids began to flutter. She looked curiously round, then turned to me.

â€œWhen are ye going to start it, maâ€™am?â€

Despite assurances from both Bobby and Malva that she had been to all appearances dead as a doornail for the last quarter hour, she refused to believe it, asserting indignantly that she couldnâ€™t have beenâ€”though at a loss to explain the prick on her finger and the slide of freshly smeared blood.

â€œYou remember the mask on your face?â€ I asked. â€œAnd my telling you to take a deep breath?â€

She nodded uncertainly.

â€œAye, I do, then, and it felt for a moment as though I were chokingâ€”but then ye were all just staring down at me, next thing!â€

â€œWell, I suppose the only way to convince her is to show her,â€ I said, smiling at the three flushed young faces. â€œBobby?â€

Eager to demonstrate the truth of the matter to Lizzie, he hopped up on the table and laid himself down with a will, though the pulse in his slender throat was hammering as Malva dripped ether on the mask. He drew a deep, convulsive gasp the moment she put it on his face. Frowning a bit, he took anotherâ€”one moreâ€”and went limp.

Lizzie clapped both hands to her mouth, staring.

â€œJesus, Joseph, and Mary!â€ she exclaimed. Malva giggled, thrilled at the effect.

Lizzie looked at me, eyes wide, then back at Bobby. Stooping to his ear, she called his name, to no effect, then picked up his hand and wiggled it gingerly. His arm waggled limply, and she made a soft exclamation and set his hand down again. She looked quite agitated.

â€œCan he no wake up again?â€

â€œNot until we take away the mask,â€ Malva told her, rather smug.

â€œYes, but you donâ€™t want to keep someone under longer than you need to,â€ I added. â€œItâ€™s not good for them to be anesthetized too long.â€

Malva obediently brought Bobby back to the edge of consciousness and put him back under several times, while I made note of times and dosages. During the last of these notes, I glanced up, to see her looking down at Bobby with an intent sort of expression, seeming to concentrate on something. Lizzie had withdrawn to a corner of the surgery, plainly made uneasy by seeing Bobby unconscious, and sat on a stool, plaiting her hair and twisting it up under her cap.

I stood up and took the mask from Malvaâ€™s hand, setting it aside.

â€œYou did a wonderful job,â€ I told her, speaking quietly. â€œThank you.â€

She shook her head, face glowing.

â€œOh, maâ€™am! It was . . . Iâ€™ve never seen the like. Itâ€™s such a feeling, is it not? Like as we killed him, and brought him alive again.â€ She spread her hands out, looking at them half-unconsciously, as though wondering how she had done such a marvel, then closed them into small fists, and smiled at me, conspiratorially.

â€œI think I see why my faither says itâ€™s devilâ€™s work. Were he to see what itâ€™s likeâ€â€”she glanced at Bobby, who was beginning to stirâ€”â€œheâ€™d say no one but God has a right to do such things.â€

â€œReally,â€ I said, rather dryly. From the gleam in her eye, her fatherâ€™s likely reaction to what we had been doing was one of the chief attractions of the experiment. For an instant, I rather pitied Tom Christie.

â€œUm . . . perhaps youâ€™d better not tell your father, then,â€ I suggested. She smiled, showing small, sharp white teeth, and rolled her eyes.

â€œDonâ€™t you think it, maâ€™am,â€ she assured me. â€œHeâ€™d stop me coming, as quick asâ€”â€

Bobby opened his eyes, turned his head to one side, and threw up, putting a stop to the discussion. Lizzie gave a cry and hurried to his side, fussing over him, wiping his face and fetching him brandy to drink. Malva, looking slightly superior, stood aside and let her.

â€œOh, thatâ€™s queer,â€ Bobby repeated, for perhaps the tenth time, rubbing a hand across his mouth. â€œI saw the most terrible thingâ€”just for a moment, thereâ€”and then I felt sick, and here it was all over.â€

â€œWhat sort of terrible thing?â€ Malva asked, interested. He glanced at her, looking wary and uncertain.

â€œI scarcely know, tell â€™ee true, miss. Only as it was . . . dark, like. A form, as you might say; I thought â€™twas a womanâ€™s. But . . . terrible,â€ he finished, helpless.

Well, that was too bad. Hallucination wasnâ€™t an uncommon side effect, but I hadnâ€™t expected it with such a brief dose.

â€œWell, I imagine it was just a bit of nightmare,â€ I said soothingly. â€œYou know, itâ€™s a form of sleep, so itâ€™s not surprising that you might get the odd bit of dreaming now and then.â€

To my surprise, Lizzie shook her head at this.

â€œOh, no, maâ€™am,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s no sleep at all. When ye sleep, ken, ye give your soul up to the angelsâ€™ keeping, so as no ghoulies shall come near. But this . . .â€ Frowning, she eyed the bottle of ether, now safely corked again, then looked at me.

â€œI did wonder,â€ she said, â€œwhere does your soul go?â€

â€œEr . . .â€ I said. â€œWell, I should think it simply stays with your body. It must. I meanâ€”you arenâ€™t dead.â€

Both Lizzie and Bobby were shaking their heads decidedly.

â€œNo, it doesnâ€™t,â€ Lizzie said. â€œWhen yeâ€™re sleepinâ€™, yeâ€™re still there. When ye do thatâ€â€”she gestured toward the mask, a faint uneasiness on her small featuresâ€”â€œyeâ€™re not.â€

â€œThatâ€™s true, mum,â€ Bobby assured me. â€œYouâ€™re not.â€

â€œDâ€™ye think maybe ye go to limbo, wiâ€™ the unbaptized babes and all?â€ Lizzie asked anxiously.

Malva gave an unladylike snort.

â€œLimboâ€™s no real place,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s only a notion thought up by the Pope.â€

Lizzieâ€™s mouth dropped open in shock at this blasphemy, but Bobby luckily distracted her by feeling dizzy and requiring to lie down.

Malva seemed inclined to go on with the argument, but beyond repeating, â€œThe Pope . . .â€ once or twice, simply stood, swaying to and fro with her mouth open, blinking a little. I glanced at Lizzie, only to find her glassy-eyed as well. She gave an enormous yawn and blinked at me, eyes watering.

It occurred to me that I was beginning to feel a trifle light-headed myself.

â€œGoodness!â€ I snatched the ether mask from Malvaâ€™s hand, and guided her hastily to a stool. â€œLet me get rid of this, or weâ€™ll all be giddy.â€

I flipped open the mask, pulled the damp wad of cotton wool out of it, and carried it outside at armâ€™s length. Iâ€™d opened both the surgery windows, to provide ventilation and save us all being gassed, but ether was insidious. Heavier than air, it tended to sink toward the floor of a room and accumulate there, unless there was a fan or some other device to remove it. I might have to operate in the open air, I thought, were I using it for any length of time.

I laid the cotton-wool pad on a stone to dry out, and came back, hoping that they were all too groggy now to continue their philosophical speculations. I didnâ€™t want them following that line of thought; let it get around the Ridge that ether separated people from their souls, and Iâ€™d never get anyone to let me use it on them, no matter how dire the situation.

â€œWell, thank you all for helping,â€ I said, smiling as I entered the room, relieved to find them all looking reasonably alert. â€œYouâ€™ve done something very useful and valuable. You can all go along about your business now, thoughâ€”Iâ€™ll tidy up.â€

Malva and Lizzie hesitated for a moment, neither girl wanting to leave Bobby to the other, but under the impetus of my shooing, drifted toward the door.

â€œWhen are ye to be wed, Miss Wemyss?â€ Malva asked casuallyâ€”and loudly enough for Bobby to hearâ€”though she certainly knew; everyone on the Ridge did.

â€œIn August,â€ Lizzie replied coolly, lifting her small nose half an inch. â€œRight after the hayingâ€”Miss Christie.â€ And then I shall be Mrs. McGillivray, her satisfied expression said. And youâ€”Miss Christieâ€”without an admirer to your name. Not that Malva attracted no notice from young men; only that her father and brother were assiduous in keeping them away from her.

â€œI wish ye great joy of it,â€ Malva said. She glanced at Bobby Higgins, then back at Lizzie, and smiled, demure beneath her starched white cap.

Bobby stayed sitting on the table for a moment, looking after the girls.

â€œBobby,â€ I said, struck by the deeply thoughtful expression on his face, â€œthe figure you saw under the anestheticâ€”did you recognize it?â€

He looked at me, then his eyes slid back to the empty doorway, as though unable to keep away.

â€œOh, no, mum,â€ he said, in such a tone of earnest conviction that I knew he lied. â€œNot at all!â€

DISPLACED PERSONS




THEY HAD STOPPED to water the horses by the edge of the small lake the Indians called Thick Rushes. It was a warm day, and they hobbled the horses, stripped, and waded into the water, spring-fed and gloriously cold. Cold enough to shock the senses and, for a moment at least, drive away Jamieâ€™s moody contemplation of the note MacDonald had delivered him from John Stuart, the Indian Superintendent of the Southern Department.

It had been complimentary enough, praising his celerity and enterprise in drawing the Snowbird Cherokee into the British sphere of influenceâ€”but had gone on to urge more vigorous involvement, pointing out Stuartâ€™s own coup in directing the choice of leaders among the Choctaws and the Chickasaw, at a congress he had himself convened two years before.

. . . The competition and anxiety of the candidates for medals and commissions was as great as can be imagined and equalled the struggles of the most aspiring and ambitious for honours and preferment in great states. I took every step to be informed of characters and filled the vacancies with the most worthy and likely to answer the purposes of maintaining order and the attachment of this nation to the British interest. I urge you to strive for similar good results to be achieved among the Cherokee.

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said aloud, popping up among the rushes and shaking water from his hair. â€œIâ€™m to depose Tsisqua, nay doubt by assassination, and bribe them all to install Pipestone Carverâ€â€”the smallest and most self-effacing Indian Jamie had ever seenâ€”â€œas peace chief. Heugh!â€ He sank again, in a rush of bubbles, entertaining himself by cursing Stuartâ€™s presumption, watching his words rise up in wavering quicksilver balls, to disappear magically at the bright light of the surface.

He rose again, gasping, then gulped air and held his breath.

â€œWhat was that?â€ said a startled voice nearby. â€œIs it them?â€

â€œNo, no,â€ said another, low and urgent. â€œThere are only two; I see them both, over there, do you see?â€

He opened his mouth and breathed like a zephyr, striving to hear over the pounding of his heart.

He had understood them, but for an instant, could not put a name to their tongue. Indians, aye, but not Cherokee, they were . . . Tuscarora, that was it.

He hadnâ€™t spoken with any Tuscarora for years; most of them had gone north in the wake of the measles epidemic that had destroyed so manyâ€”going to join their Mohawk â€œfathersâ€ in the lands ruled by the Iroquois League.

These two were arguing in whispers, but near enough that he made out most of what they said; they were no more than a few feet from him, hidden by a thick growth of rushes and cattail plants that stood nearly as high as a manâ€™s head.

Where was Ian? He could hear distant splashing, at the far end of the lake, and turning his head gently, saw from the corner of his eye that Ian and Rollo were sporting in the water, the dog submerged to his ruff, paddling to and fro. If one didnâ€™t knowâ€”and the beast didnâ€™t sense the intruders and barkâ€”it looked very much like two men swimming.

The Indians had concluded that this was likely the caseâ€”two horses, thus two men, and both safely distant. With much creaking and rustling, they began to make their way stealthily in the direction of the horses.

Jamie was half-inclined to let them try to take Gideon and see how far they got with such an enterprise. But they might only make off with Ianâ€™s horse and the pack muleâ€”and Claire would be fashit, did he let them take Clarence. Feeling himself very much at a disadvantage, he slithered naked through the reeds, grimacing at the rasp of them on his skin, and crawled up among the cattails, into the mud of the shore.

Had they the wit to look back, they must have seen the cattails shakingâ€”and he hoped Ian would seeâ€”but they were intent on their errand. He could glimpse them now, skulking in the tall grass at the forest edge, glancing to and froâ€”but never in the right direction.

Only two, he was sure of that now. Young, from the way they moved, and unsure. He couldnâ€™t see if they were armed.

Slimed with mud, he crept further, sinking onto his belly in the rank grasses near the lake, squirming rapidly toward the shelter of a sumac bush. What he wanted was a club, and quickly.

In such circumstances, of course, nothing came to hand but twigs and long-rotted branches. For lack of better, he seized a good-sized stone, but then found what he wanted: a dogwood branch cracked by wind and hanging in reach, still attached to the tree. They were approaching the grazing horses now; Gideon saw them and lifted his head abruptly. He went on chewing, but his ears lay half back in patent suspicion. Clarence, the ever-sociable, took notice and raised his head, as well, ears twitching to alertness.

Jamie seized the chance, and as Clarence emitted a welcoming bray, he ripped the branch from the tree and charged the intruders, roaring, â€œTulach Ard!â€ at the top of his voice.

Wide eyes met his, and one man bolted, long hair flying. The other followed, but limping badly, going down on one knee as something gave way. He was up again at once, but too slow; Jamie swept the branch at his legs with a two-handed fury that knocked him flat, and leapt on his back, driving a vicious knee into his kidney.

The man made a strangled noise and froze, paralyzed by pain. Jamie had dropped his rockâ€”no, there it was. He snatched it up and thumped the man solidly behind the ear, for luck. Then he was off and running after the other, who had made for the wood but sheered off, blocked by a rock-bound streamlet in his path. Now the man was bounding through the sedges; Jamie saw him cast a terrified look toward the water, where Ian and Rollo were making their way toward him, swimming like beaver.

The Indian might have made it to the sanctuary of the forest, had one foot not suddenly sunk in soft mud. He staggered sideways, and Jamie was on him, feet sliding in the mud, grappling.

The man was young and wiry and fought like an eel. Jamie, with the advantage of size and weight, managed to push him over, and they fell together and rolled about in the sedges and mud, clawing and thumping. The Indian caught Jamieâ€™s long hair and yanked, bringing tears to his eyes; he punched the man hard in the ribs to make him let go, and when he did, butted him in the face.

Their foreheads met with a dull thunk, and blinding pain shot through his head. They fell apart, gasping, and Jamie rolled up onto his knees, head spinning and eyes watering, trying to see.

There was a blur of gray and a shriek of terror. Rollo gave one deep-chested, snarling bark, then settled into a rumbling, continuous growl. Jamie shut one eye, a hand to his throbbing forehead, and made out his opponent lying flat in the mud, Rollo poised over him, black lips drawn back to show all his teeth.

The splash of feet running through the shallows, and Ian was there, gasping for breath.

â€œAre ye all right, Uncle Jamie?â€

He took his hand away and looked at his fingers. No blood, though he would have sworn his head was split open.

â€œNo,â€ he said, â€œbut better than him. Oh, Jesus.â€

â€œDid ye kill the other one?â€

â€œProbably not. Oh, God.â€

Lowering himself to his hands and knees, he crawled a short distance away and threw up. Behind him, he could hear Ian sharply demanding to know who the men were and whether there were others with them, in Cherokee.

â€œTheyâ€™re Tuscarora,â€ he said. His head still throbbed, but he felt a little better.

â€œOh, aye?â€ Ian was surprised, but at once shifted into the tongue of the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka. The young captive, already terrorized by Rollo, looked as though he might die of fright, seeing Ianâ€™s tattoos and hearing him speak Mohawk. Kahnyenâ€™kehaka was of the same family as Tuscarora, and plainly the young man could make out what Ian said, for he replied, stammering with fear. They were alone. Was his brother dead?

Jamie rinsed his mouth with water, splashed it on his face. That was better, though a lump like a duckâ€™s egg was swelling over his left eye.

â€œBrother?â€

Yes, the young man said, his brother. If they did not mean to kill him now, might he go and see? His brother was wounded.

Ian glanced at Jamie for agreement, then called Rollo off with a word. The bedraggled captive struggled painfully to his feet, staggering, and set off back along the shore, followed by the dog and the two naked Scots.

The other man was indeed wounded; blood was seeping through a crude bandage round his leg. He had made the bandage of his shirt, and was bare-chested, scrawny, and starved-looking. Jamie glanced from one to the other; neither could be older than twenty, he thought, and likely younger than that, with their faces pinched by hunger and ill-usage, their clothes little more than rags.

The horses had moved off a little, nervous of the fighting, but the clothes the Scots had left hanging from the bushes were still there. Ian pulled on his breeches and went to fetch food and drink from the saddlebags, while Jamie dressed more slowly, interrogating the young man as the latter anxiously examined his brother.

They were Tuscarora, the young man confirmed. His name was a long one, meaning roughly â€œthe gleam of light on water in a springâ€; this was his brother, â€œthe goose that encourages the leader when they fly,â€ more simply known as Goose.

â€œWhat happened to him?â€ Jamie pulled his shirt over his head and noddedâ€”wincing at the movementâ€”at the gash in Gooseâ€™s leg, quite obviously made by something like an ax.

Light on Water took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a moment. He had a substantial knot on his head, as well.

â€œTsalagi,â€ he said. â€œWe were two score in number; the rest are dead, or taken. You will not give us to them, Lord? Please?â€

â€œTsalagi? Which?â€

Light shook his head; he could not say. His band had chosen to stay when his village moved north, but they had not prospered; there were not enough men to defend a village and hunt, and without defenders, others stole their crops, took their women.

Growing poorer, they, too, had taken to stealing and to begging to survive through the winter. More had died of cold and sickness, and the remnants moved from place to place, now and then finding a place to settle for a few weeks, but then driven out by the much stronger Cherokee.

A few days past, they had been set upon by a party of Cherokee warriors, who had taken them by surprise, killed most of them, and taken some women.

â€œThey took my wife,â€ Light said, his voice unsteady. â€œWe came toâ€”to take her back.â€

â€œThey will kill us, of course,â€ said Goose weakly, but with a fair amount of cheerfulness. â€œBut that doesnâ€™t signify.â€

â€œOf course not,â€ Jamie said, smiling despite himself. â€œDo you know where they took her?â€

The brothers knew the direction taken by the raiders, and had been following, to track them to their village. That way, they said, pointing toward a notch. Ian glanced at Jamie, and nodded.

â€œBird,â€ he said. â€œOr Fox, I should say,â€ for Running Fox was war chief of the village; a good warrior, though somewhat lacking in imaginationâ€”a trait Bird possessed in quantity.

â€œShall we help them, then?â€ Ian said in English. His feathery brows arched in question, but Jamie could see that it was a question in form only.

â€œOh, aye, I expect we will.â€ He rubbed gingerly at his forehead; the skin over the lump was already stretched and tender. â€œLetâ€™s eat first, though.â€



IT WAS NOT a question of whether the thing might be done; only how. Jamie and Ian both dismissed out of hand any suggestion that the brothers might steal back Lightâ€™s wife.

â€œThey will kill ye,â€ Ian assured them.

â€œWe donâ€™t mind,â€ Light said stoutly.

â€œOf course ye donâ€™t,â€ said Jamie. â€œBut what of your wife? Sheâ€™d be left alone, then, and in no better case.â€

Goose nodded judiciously.

â€œHeâ€™s right, you know,â€ he said to his glowering brother.

â€œWe could ask for her,â€ Jamie suggested. â€œA wife for you, Ian. Bird thinks well of ye; heâ€™d likely give her to you.â€

He was only half-joking. If no one had yet taken the young woman to wife, the person who had her as slave might be persuaded to give her to Ian, who was deeply respected.

Ian gave a perfunctory smile, but shook his head.

â€œNay, weâ€™d best ransom her. Orâ€”â€ He looked consideringly at the two Indians, industriously eating their way through the remainder of the food in the saddlebags. â€œMight we ask Bird to adopt them?â€

That was a thought, to be sure. For once they had got the young woman back, by whatever means, she and the brothers would be in the same dire caseâ€”wandering and hungry.

The brothers frowned, though, and shook their heads.

â€œFood is a good thing,â€ Goose said, licking his fingers. â€œBut we saw them kill our family, our friends. If we hadnâ€™t seen it ourselves, it would be possible. Butâ€”â€

â€œAye, I see,â€ Jamie said, and was struck for an instant by mild astonishment that he did see; evidently, he had spent longer among the Indians than he supposed.

The brothers exchanged glances, obviously communicating something. Decision made, Light made a gesture of respect to Jamie.

â€œWe are your slaves,â€ he pointed out with some diffidence. â€œIt is yours to decide what to do with us.â€ He paused delicately, waiting.

Jamie rubbed a hand over his face, considering that perhaps he hadnâ€™t spent quite enough time with Indians after all. Ian didnâ€™t smile, but seemed to emit a low vibration of amusement.

MacDonald had told him stories of campaigns during the French and Indian War; soldiers who took Indian prisoners commonly either killed them for scalp money or sold them as slaves. Those campaigns lay a scant ten years in the past; the peace since had been frequently uneasy, and God knew the various Indians made slaves of their prisoners, unless they choseâ€”for whatever inscrutable Indian motiveâ€”to adopt or kill them, instead.

Jamie had captured the two Tuscarora; ergo, by custom, they were now his slaves.

He understood quite well what Light was suggestingâ€”that he adopt the brothers, and doubtless the young woman, too, once heâ€™d rescued herâ€”and how in Godâ€™s name had he suddenly become responsible for doing that?

â€œWell, thereâ€™s nay market for their scalps just now,â€ Ian pointed out. â€œThough I suppose ye could sell the two of them to Bird. Though theyâ€™re no worth a great deal, scrawny and ill-feckit as they are.â€

The brothers stared at him, impassive, awaiting his decision. Light belched suddenly, and looked surprised at the sound. Ian did laugh at that, a low creaking noise.

â€œOh, I couldna do any such thing, and the three of ye ken that perfectly well,â€ Jamie said crossly. â€œI should have hit ye harder and saved myself trouble,â€ he said to Goose, who grinned at him, with gap-toothed good nature.

â€œYes, Uncle,â€ he said, bowing low in deep respect.

Jamie made a displeased sound in response, but the two Indians took no notice.

It would have to be the medals, then. MacDonald had brought him a chest bulging with medals, gilt buttons, cheap brass compasses, steel knife blades, and other bits of attractive rubbish. Since the chiefs derived their power from their popularity, and their popularity increased in direct proportion to their ability to give gifts, the British Indian agents exerted influence by distributing largesse to those chiefs who indicated a willingness to ally themselves to the Crown.

Heâ€™d brought only two small bags of such bribery; the rest left at home for future use. What he had on hand would, he was sure, be sufficient to ransom Mrs. Light, but to expend it all in such fashion would leave him empty-handed with respect to the other village chiefsâ€”and that wouldnâ€™t do.

Well, and he supposed he must send Ian back, then, to fetch more. But not until heâ€™d arranged the ransom; he wanted Ianâ€™s help in that matter.

â€œFine, then,â€ he said, standing up. He fought off a wave of dizziness. â€œBut I am not adopting them.â€ The last thing he needed just this minute was three more mouths to feed.

SCOTCHEE




ARRANGING THE RANSOM was, as he had supposed, a simple matter of bargaining. And in the end, Mrs. Light came fairly cheap, at the price of six medals, four knives, and a compass. Granted, he hadnâ€™t seen her until the conclusion of the dealingâ€”if he had, he might have offered even less; she was a small, pockmarked lass of perhaps fourteen, with a slight walleye.

Still, he reflected, there was no accounting for taste, and both Light and Goose had been willing to die for her. Doubtless she had a kind heart, or some other excellent quality of character, such as a talent and affinity for bed.

He was quite shocked to find himself thinking such a thing, and looked at her more closely. It was in no way obviousâ€”and yet, now that he did lookâ€”she did radiate that strange appeal, that remarkable gift, held by a few women, that bypassed such superficial appreciations as looks, age, or wit, and caused a man simply to wish to seize her andâ€”

He choked the sprouting image off at the root. Heâ€™d known a few such women, most of them French. And had thought more than once that perhaps it was his own wifeâ€™s French heritage that was responsible for her possession of that most desirable but very dangerous gift.

He could see Bird eyeing the girl thoughtfully, quite obviously regretting that he had let her go for so little. Fortunately, a distraction occurred to drive the matter from his attentionâ€”the return of a hunting party, bringing with them guests.

The guests were Cherokee of the Overhill Band, far from their home in the Tennessee mountains. And with them was a man Jamie had often heard of, but never met until this dayâ€”one Alexander Cameron, whom the Indians called â€œScotchee.â€

A dark, weathered man of middle-age, Cameron was distinguishable from the Indians only by his heavy beard and the long, inquisitive shape of his nose. He had lived with the Cherokee since the age of fifteen, had a Cherokee wife, and was much esteemed among them. He was also an Indian agent, thick with John Stuart. And his presence here, two hundred miles from home, caused Jamieâ€™s own long, inquisitive nose to twitch with interest.

The interest was frankly mutual; Cameron examined him with deep-set eyes in which intelligence and wiliness showed in equal measure.

â€œThe redheided Bear-Killer, och, och!â€ he exclaimed, shaking Jamie warmly by the hand, and then embracing him in the Indian fashion. â€œIâ€™ve heard such tales of ye, ken, and fair dyinâ€™ to meet ye to see were they true.â€

â€œI doubt it,â€ Jamie said. â€œThe last one I heard myself, Iâ€™d done for three bears at once, killinâ€™ the last of them high in a tree, where heâ€™d chased me after chewinâ€™ off my foot.â€

Despite himself, Cameron looked down at Jamieâ€™s feet, then looked up and hooted with laughter, all the lines of his face curving in such irresistible merriment that Jamie felt his own laughter bubble up.

It was not, of course, proper to speak of business yet awhile. The hunting party had brought down one of the woods buffaloes, and a great feast was preparing: the liver taken away to be singed and devoured at once, the strap of tender meat from the back roasted with whole onions, and the heartâ€”so Ian told himâ€”to be shared among the four of them: Jamie, Cameron, Bird, and Running Fox, a mark of honor.

After the liver had been eaten, they retired to Birdâ€™s house to drink beer for an hour or two, while the women made ready the rest of the food. And in the course of nature, he found himself outside, having a comfortable piss against a tree, when a quiet footfall came behind him, and Alexander Cameron stepped up alongside, undoing the fall of his breeches.

It seemed naturalâ€”though plainly Cameron had intended itâ€”to walk about together for a bit then, the cool air of the evening a respite from the smoke inside the house, and speak of things of common interestâ€”John Stuart, for one, and the ways and means of the Southern Department. Indians, for another; comparing the personalities and means of dealing with the various village chiefs, speculating as to who would make a leader, and whether there might be a great congress called within the year.

â€œYeâ€™ll be wondering, I expect,â€ Cameron said quite casually, â€œat my presence here?â€

Jamie made a slight motion of the shoulders, admitting interest, but indicating a polite lack of inquisition into Cameronâ€™s affairs.

Cameron chuckled.

â€œAye, well. Itâ€™s no secret, to be sure. Itâ€™s James Henderson, is what it isâ€”yeâ€™ll ken the name, maybe?â€

He did. Henderson had been Chief Justice of the Superior Court in North Carolinaâ€”until the Regulation had caused him to leave, climbing out the window of his courthouse and fleeing for his life from a mob bent on violence.

A wealthy man, and one with a due regard for the value of his skin, Henderson had retired from public life and set about increasing his fortune. To which end, he proposed now to buy an enormous tract of land from the Cherokee, this located in Tennessee, and establish townships there.

Jamie gave Cameron an eye, apprehending at once the complexity of the situation. For the one thing, the lands in question lay far, far inside the Treaty Line. For Henderson to instigate such dealings was an indicationâ€”had any been neededâ€”of just how feeble the grasp of the Crown had grown of late. Plainly, Henderson thought nothing of flouting His Majestyâ€™s treaty, and expected no interference with his affairs as a result of doing so.

That was one thing. For another, thoughâ€”the Cherokee held land in common, as all the Indians did. Leaders could and did sell land to whites, without such legal niceties as clear title, but were still subject to the ex post facto approval or disapproval of their people. Such approval would not affect the sale, which would be already accomplished, but could result in the fall of a leader, and in a good deal of trouble for the man who tried to take possession of land paid for in good faithâ€”or what passed for good faith, in such dealings.

â€œJohn Stuart knows of this, of course,â€ Jamie said, and Cameron nodded, with a small air of complacency.

â€œNot officially, mind,â€ he said.

Naturally not. The Superintendent of Indian Affairs could hardly countenance such an arrangement officially. At the same time, it would be smiled on unofficially, as such a purchase could not help but further the departmentâ€™s goal of bringing the Indians further under the sway of British influence.

Jamie wondered idly whether Stuart profited in any personal way from the sale. Stuart had a good reputation and was not known to be corruptâ€”but he might well have a silent interest in the matter. Then again, he might have no financial interest himself, and be turning an officially blind eye to the arrangement only in furtherance of the departmentâ€™s purposes.

Cameron, though . . . He couldnâ€™t say, of course, but would be most surprised if Cameron had no finger in the pie.

He did not know where Cameronâ€™s natural interest lay, whether with the Indians among whom he lived or with the British to whom he had been born. He doubted that anyone didâ€”perhaps not even Cameron. Regardless of his abiding interests, though, Cameronâ€™s immediate goals were clear. He wished the sale to be met with approvalâ€”or at least indifferenceâ€”by the surrounding Cherokee, thus keeping his own pet chiefs in good odor with their followers, and allowing Henderson to go forward with his plans with no undue harassment by Indians in the area.

â€œI shall not, of course, say anything for a day or two,â€ Cameron told him, and he nodded. There was a natural rhythm to such business. But of course, Cameron had told him now so that he might be of help when the subject arose in due course.

Cameron took it for granted that he would help. There was no explicit promise of a bit of Hendersonâ€™s pie for himself, but no need; it was the sort of opportunity that was a perquisite of being an Indian agentâ€”the reason that such appointments were considered plums.

Given what Jamie knew of the near future, he had neither expectation nor interest in Hendersonâ€™s purchaseâ€”but the subject did give him a welcome opportunity for a useful quid pro quo.

He coughed gently.

â€œYe ken the wee Tuscarora lassie I bought from Bird?â€

Cameron laughed.

â€œAye. And heâ€™s most perplexed what ye mean to do with her; he says ye willna take any of the lasses he sends to warm your bed. Sheâ€™s no so much to look atâ€”but still . . .â€

â€œNot that,â€ Jamie assured him. â€œSheâ€™s marrit, for the one thing. I brought two Tuscaroran lads with me; she belongs to one of them.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ Cameronâ€™s nose twitched with interest, scenting a story. Jamie had been waiting for this opportunity since the sight of Cameron first gave him the notion, and he told it well, with the satisfactory outcome that Cameron agreed to take the three displaced young Tuscaroras with him, and sponsor their adoption into the Overhill Band.

â€œItâ€™ll no be the first time,â€ he told Jamie. â€œThere are more and more of themâ€”wee scraps of what were villages, even whole peoplesâ€”wandering about the country starved and wretched. Heard of the Dogash, have ye?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œNor are ye like to,â€ Cameron said, shaking his head. â€œThereâ€™s no but ten or so of them left. They came to us last winter; offered themselves as slaves, only so that they might survive the cold. Noâ€”dinna fash yourself, man,â€ he assured Jamie, catching sight of Jamieâ€™s expression. â€œYour wee lads and the lass wonâ€™t be slaves; my word on it.â€

Jamie nodded his thanks, pleased with the business. They had wandered some distance outside the village, and stood talking near the edge of a gorge, where the wood opened suddenly over a vista of mountain ranges, rolling away and away like furrows plowed in some endless field of the gods, their backs dark and brooding beneath a starlit sky.

â€œHow can there ever be people enough to settle such a wilderness?â€ he said, moved suddenly by the sight of it. And yet the smell of woodsmoke and cooking meat hung heavy in the air. People did inhabit it, few and scattered as they were.

Cameron shook his head in contemplation.

â€œThey come,â€ he said, â€œand they keep on coming. My ain folk came from Scotland. You have,â€ he added, teeth a brief gleam in his beard. â€œAnd dinna mean to go back, Iâ€™ll warrant.â€

Jamie smiled at that, but made no answer, though a queer feeling rose in his wame at the thought. He did not mean to go back. Had said goodbye to Scotland at the rail of the Artemis, knowing full well it was likely his last sight of the place. And yet, the notion that he would never set foot there again had never fully settled on him â€™til this moment.

Calls of â€œScotchee, Scotcheeâ€ summoned them, and he turned to follow Cameron back to the village, conscious all the time of the glorious, terrifying emptiness behind himâ€”and the more terrifying emptiness within.



THEY SMOKED THAT night, after feasting, in ceremonious observance of Jamieâ€™s bargain with Bird, in welcome to Cameron. When the pipe had gone twice around the fire, they began to tell stories.

Stories of raids, of battles. Exhausted from the day, head still throbbing, mellowed by food and spruce beer, and slightly intoxicated by the smoke, Jamie had meant only to listen. Perhaps it was the thought of Scotland, so casually evoked by Cameronâ€™s remark. But at some point, a memory had stirred, and when the next expectant silence fell, he was surprised to hear his own voice, telling them of Culloden.

â€œAnd there near a wall I saw a man I knew, named MacAllister, besieged by a horde of enemies. He fought with gun and sword, but both failed himâ€”his blade was broken, his shield shattered upon his breast.â€

The fume of the pipe reached him and he raised it and drew deep, as though he drank the air of the moor, hazed with rain and the smoke of the day.

â€œStill they came, his enemies, to kill him, and he seized up a piece of metal, the tongue of a wagon, and with it, killed sixâ€â€”he held up both hands, fingers stuck up in illustrationâ€”â€œsix of them, before he was at last brought down.â€

Sounds of awe and tongue clicks of approval greeted this recounting.

â€œAnd you yourself, Bear-Killer, how many men did you kill in this battle?â€

The smoke burned in his chest, behind his eyes, and for an instant he tasted the bitter smoke of cannon fire, not sweet tobacco. He sawâ€”he sawâ€”Alistair MacAllister, dead at his feet among the red-clothed bodies, the side of his head crushed in and the round curve of his shoulder shining solid through the cloth of the shirt, so wetly did it cling to him.

He was there, on the moor, the wet and cold no more than a shimmer on his skin, rain slick on his face, his own shirt sopping and steaming on him with the heat of his rage.

And then he no longer stood on Drumossie, and became aware a second too late of the indrawn breaths around him. He saw Robert Talltreeâ€™s face, the wrinkles all turned up in astonishment, and only then looked down, to see all ten of his fingers flex and fold, and the four fingers of the right extend again, quite without his meaning it. The thumb wavered, indecisive. He watched this with fascination, then, coming finally to his wits, balled his right hand as well as he could and wrapped the left around it, as though to throttle the memory that had been thrust with such unnerving suddenness into the palm of his hand.

He looked up to see Talltree glance sharply at his face, and he saw the dark old eyes harden, then narrow under a frownâ€”and then the old man took the pipe, drank deep, and blew the smoke across him, bowing forward. Talltree did this twice more, and a hum of hushed approval at the honor came from the clustered men.

He took the pipe and returned the honor of the gesture, then passed it to the next man, refusing to speak further.

They didnâ€™t push him to, seeming to recognize and respect the shock he felt.

Shock. Not even that. What he felt was the blankest astonishment. Cautiously, unwilling, he stole a keek at that picture of Alistair. God, it was there.

He realized that he was holding his breath, not wanting to breathe the reek of blood and spilled bowels. He breathed, soft smoke and a copper tang of seasoned bodies, and could have wept, swept with sudden longing for the cold, sharp air of the Highlands, pungent with the scents of peat and gorse.

Alexander Cameron said something to him, but he couldnâ€™t reply. Ian, seeing the difficulty, leaned forward to answer, and they all laughed. Ian gave him a curious look, but then turned back to the conversation, beginning a story of a famous game of lacrosse he had played among the Mohawk. Leaving Jamie to sit still, wreathed in the smoke.

Fourteen men. And he did not remember a single face. And that random thumb, hovering uncertainly. Whatever did he mean by that? That he had fought yet another, but not made certain of the fellow?

He was afraid even to think of the memory. Unsure what to do with it. But at the same time, conscious of a sense of awe. And despite everything, grateful to have this small thing back.



IT WAS VERY LATE, and most of the men had gone to their own houses, or lay comfortably asleep around the fire. Ian had left the fire, but hadnâ€™t come back. Cameron was still there, smoking his own pipe now, though he shared this with Bird, taking turn and turn about.

â€œThere is a thing I would tell you,â€ Jamie said abruptly, in the midst of a drowsy silence. â€œBoth of you.â€ Bird raised his brows in slow question, drugged with tobacco.

He hadnâ€™t known he meant to say it. Had thought to wait, judge his timeâ€”if he spoke at all. Perhaps it was the closeness of the house, the dark intimacy of the fireside, or the intoxication of tobacco. Perhaps only the kinship of an exile for those who would suffer the same fate. But heâ€™d spoken; had no choice now but to tell them what he knew.

â€œThe women of my family are . . .â€ He groped, not knowing the Cherokee word. â€œThose who see in dreams what is to come.â€ He darted a look at Cameron, who appeared to take this in his stride, for he nodded, and closed his eyes to draw smoke into his lungs.

â€œHave they the Sight, then?â€ he asked, mildly interested.

Jamie nodded; it was as good an explanation as any.

â€œThey have seen a thing concerning the Tsalagi. Both my wife and my daughter have seen this thing.â€

Birdâ€™s attention sharpened, hearing this. Dreams were important; for more than one person to share a dream was extraordinary, and therefore most important.

â€œIt grieves me to tell you,â€ Jamie said, and meant it. â€œSixty years from this time, the Tsalagi will be taken from their lands, removed to a new place. Many will die on this journey, so that the path they tread will be called . . .â€ He groped for the word for â€œtears,â€ did not find it, and ended, â€œthe trail where they wept.â€

Birdâ€™s lips pursed, as though to draw smoke, but the pipe fumed unnoticed in his hands.

â€œWho will do this?â€ he asked. â€œWho can?â€

Jamie drew a deep breath; here was the difficulty. And yetâ€”so much less difficult than he had thought, now that it came to the matter.

â€œIt will be white men,â€ he said. â€œBut it will not be King Georgeâ€™s men.â€

â€œThe French?â€ Cameron spoke with a hint of incredulity, but frowned, nonetheless, trying to see how this might come to pass. â€œOr the Spanish, do they mean? The Spanish are a good deal closerâ€”but none sae many.â€ Spain still held the country south of Georgia, and parts of the Indies, but the English held Georgia firmly; there was little apparent chance of any northward movement by the Spaniards.

â€œNo. Not Spanish, not French.â€ He could wish Ian had stayed, for more than one reason. But the lad had not, and so he would have to struggle with the Tsalagi, which was an interesting tongue, but one in which he could talk fluently only of solid thingsâ€”and of a very limited future.

â€œWhat they tell meâ€”what my women sayâ€”â€ He struggled to find sensible words. â€œA thing that they see in their dreams, this thing will come to pass, if it concerns many people. But they think it may not come to pass, if it concerns a few, or one.â€

Bird blinked, confusedâ€”and no wonder. Grimly, Jamie tried again to explain.

â€œThere are large things, and there are small things. A large thing is a thing like a great battle, or the raising up of a notable chiefâ€”though he is one man, he is raised up by the voices of many. If my women dream of these large things, then they will happen. But in any large thing, there are many people. Some say do this; others, do that.â€ He zigzagged his hand to and fro, and Bird nodded.

â€œSo. If many people say, â€˜Do thisâ€™â€â€”he stabbed his fingers sharply to the leftâ€”â€œthen this happens. But what of the people who said, â€˜do thatâ€™?â€ And he jerked a thumb back the other way. â€œThese people may choose a different way.â€

Bird made the hm-hm-hm! sound he used when startled.

â€œSo it may be that some will not go?â€ Cameron asked sharply. â€œThey might escape?â€

â€œI hope so,â€ Jamie said simply.

They sat in silence for a bit, each man staring into the fire, each seeing his own visionsâ€”of the future, or the past.

â€œThis wife you have,â€ Bird said at last, deeply contemplative, â€œdid you pay a great deal for her?â€

â€œShe cost me almost everything I had,â€ he said, with a wry tone that made the others laugh. â€œBut worth it.â€



IT WAS VERY LATE when he went to the guesthouse; the moon had set, and the sky had that look of deep serenity, the stars singing to themselves in endless night. His body ached in every muscle, and he was so tired that he stumbled on the threshold. His instincts were still working, though, and he felt, rather than saw, someone move in the shadows of the sleeping-couch.

God, Bird was still at it. Well, tonight it wouldnâ€™t matter; he could lie naked with a covey of young women, and sleep sound. Too exhausted to be annoyed by her presence, he struggled for some polite acknowledgment of the woman. Then she stood up.

The firelight showed him an elderly woman, her hair in grizzled plaits, her dress of white buckskin decorated with paint and porcupine quills. He recognized Calls-in-the-Forest, dressed in her best. Birdâ€™s sense of humor had finally got completely out of hand; he had sent Jamie his mother.

All grasp of Tsalagi deserted him. He opened his mouth, but merely gaped at her. She smiled, very slightly, and held out her hand.

â€œCome and lie down, Bear-Killer,â€ she said. Her voice was kind and gruff. â€œIâ€™ve come to comb the snakes from your hair.â€

She drew him unresisting to the couch, and made him lie down with his head in her lap. Sure enough; she unplaited his hair and spread it out across her knees, her touch soothing to his throbbing head and the painful knot on his brow.

He had no idea how old she might be, but her fingers were muscular and tireless, making small, rhythmic circles in his scalp, on his temples, behind his ears, near to the bone at the base of his skull. She had thrown sweet grass and some other herb on the fire; the chimney hole was drawing well and he could see white smoke rising upward in a wavering pillar, very calm, but a sense of constant movement in it.

She was humming to herself, or rather whispering some song, the words too indistinct to make out. He watched the silent shapes stream upward in the smoke, and felt his body growing heavy, limbs filled with wet sand, his body a sandbag placed in the path of a flood.

â€œTalk, Bear-Killer,â€ she said very softly, breaking off her chant. She had a wooden comb in her hand; he felt the teeth of it caress his scalp, rounded with wear.

â€œI cannot call your words to me,â€ he said, searching for each word in Tsalagi, and thus speaking very slowly. She made a small snorting noise in reply.

â€œThe words donâ€™t matter, nor the tongue in which you speak,â€ she said. â€œOnly talk. I will understand.â€

And so he began haltingly to speakâ€”in Gaelic, as it was the only tongue that didnâ€™t seem to require any effort. He understood that he was to speak of what filled his heart, and so began with Scotlandâ€”and Culloden. Of grief. Of loss. Of fear.

And in the speaking turned from past to future, where he saw these three specters loom again, cold creatures coming toward him out of the fog, looking through their empty eyes.

Another stood among themâ€”Jack Randallâ€”confusingly on both sides of him. Those eyes were not empty, but alive, intent in a misty face. Had he killed the man, or not? If he had, did the ghost follow at his heels? Or if he had not, was it the thought of vengeance unsatisfied that haunted him, taunted him with its imperfect memory?

But in the speaking, he seemed somehow to rise a little way above his body, and see himself at rest, eyes open, fixed upward, his hair darkly flaming in a halo round his head, streaked with the silver of his age. And here he saw that he merely was, in a place between, apart. And quite alone. At peace.

â€œI hold to no evil in my heart,â€ he said, hearing his voice come slow, from a long way off. â€œThis evil does not touch me. More may come, but not this. Not here. Not now.â€

â€œI understand,â€ whispered the old woman, and went on combing his hair as the white smoke rose silent toward the hole to the sky.

A TAINT IN THE BLOOD




June 1774

I SAT BACK ON MY HEELS and stretched, tired but pleased. My back ached, my knees creaked like hinges, my fingernails were caked with dirt, and strands of hair stuck to my neck and cheeksâ€”but the new crops of pole beans, onions, turnips, and radishes were planted, the cabbages weeded and culled, and a dozen large peanut bushes had been pulled up and hung to dry on the garden palisades, safe from marauding squirrels.

I glanced up at the sun; still above the chestnut trees. Time enough then before supper for a last chore or two. I stood up and surveyed my small kingdom, debating where best to spend my remaining time. Rooting up the catmint and lemon balm that threatened to engulf the far corner of the garden? Carting baskets of nicely rotted manure up from the heap behind the barn? No, that was manâ€™s work.

Herbs? My three French lavender bushes stood knee-high, thick with deep blue swabs on slender stalks, and the yarrow was well in bloom, with lacy umbels of white and pink and yellow. I rubbed a finger under my itching nose, trying to recall whether this was the proper phase of the moon in which to cut yarrow. Lavender and rosemary should be cut in the morning, though, when the volatile oils had risen with the sun; it wasnâ€™t as potent if taken later in the day.

Down with the mint, then. I reached for the hoe I had left leaning against the fence, saw a face leering through the palisades, and started back, my heart leaping into my throat.

â€œOh!â€ My visitor had jumped back, too, equally startled. â€œBitte, maâ€™am! Didnâ€™t mean to fright ye.â€

It was Manfred McGillivray, peeping shyly through the drooping vines of morning glory and wild yam. Heâ€™d come earlier in the day, bringing a canvas-wrapped bundle containing several muskets for Jamie.

â€œThatâ€™s all right.â€ I stooped to pick up the hoe I had dropped. â€œAre you looking for Lizzie? Sheâ€™s inâ€”â€

â€œAch, no, maâ€™am. That is, Iâ€”do ye think I might have a word, maâ€™am?â€ he asked abruptly. â€œAlone, like?â€

â€œOf course. Come along in; we can talk while I hoe.â€

He nodded, and went round to let himself in by the gate. What might he want with me? I wondered. He had on a coat and boots, both covered in dust, and his breeches were badly creased. Heâ€™d been riding some way, then, not just from his familyâ€™s cabinâ€”and he hadnâ€™t been into the house yet; Mrs. Bug would have dusted him off, forcibly.

â€œWhere have you come from?â€ I asked, offering him the gourd dipper from my water bucket. He accepted it, drinking thirstily, then wiped his mouth politely on his sleeve.

â€œThank ye, maâ€™am. Iâ€™ve been to Hillsboro, for to fetch the . . . er . . . the things for Mr. Fraser.â€

â€œReally? That seems a long way,â€ I said mildly.

A look of profound uneasiness crossed his face. He was a nice-looking boy, tanned and handsome as a young faun under his crop of dark, curly hair, but he looked almost furtive now, glancing back over his shoulder toward the house, as though fearful of interruption.

â€œI . . . um . . . well, maâ€™am, thatâ€™s to do, a bit, with what I meant to speak to ye about.â€

â€œOh? Well . . .â€ I made a cordial gesture, indicating that he should feel free to unburden himself, and turned away to begin my hoeing, so that he might feel less self-conscious. I was beginning to suspect what he wanted to ask me, though I wasnâ€™t sure what Hillsboro had to do with it.

â€œItâ€™s . . . ah . . . well, itâ€™s to do with Mrs. Lizzie,â€ he began, folding his hands behind him.

â€œYes?â€ I said encouragingly, nearly sure that I was right in my suppositions. I glanced toward the western end of the garden, where the bees were buzzing happily among the tall yellow umbels of the dauco plants. Well, it was better than the eighteenth-century notion of condoms, at least.

â€œI canâ€™t marry her,â€ he blurted.

â€œWhat?â€ I stopped hoeing and straightened up, staring at him. His lips were pressed tightly together, and I saw now that what I had taken for shyness had been his attempt to mask a deep unhappiness that now showed plainly in the lines of his face.

â€œYouâ€™d better come and sit down.â€ I led him to the small bench Jamie had made me, set beneath the shade of a black gum tree that overhung the north side of the garden.

He sat, head drooping and hands trapped between his knees. I took off my broad-brimmed sun hat, wiped my face on my apron, and pinned up my hair more neatly, breathing in the cool freshness of the spruce and balsam trees that grew on the slope above.

â€œWhat is it?â€ I asked gently, seeing that he did not know how to start. â€œAre you afraid that perhaps you donâ€™t love her?â€

He gave me a startled look, then turned his head back to the studied contemplation of his knees.

â€œOh. No, maâ€™am. I meanâ€”I donâ€™t, but thatâ€™s no matter.â€

â€œIt isnâ€™t?â€

â€œNo. I meanâ€”Iâ€™m sure we should grow to be fond of one another, meine Mutter says so. And I like her well enough now, to be sure,â€ he added hastily, as though fearing this might sound insulting. â€œDa says sheâ€™s a tidy wee soul, and my sisters are verra fond of her indeed.â€

I made a noncommittal sound. I had had my doubts about this match to begin with, and it was beginning to sound as though they were justified.

â€œIs there . . . perhaps someone else?â€ I asked delicately.

Manfred shook his head slowly, and I heard him swallow hard.

â€œNo, maâ€™am,â€ he said in a low voice.

â€œYouâ€™re sure?â€

â€œAye, maâ€™am.â€ He drew a deep breath. â€œI meanâ€”there was. But thatâ€™s all done with now.â€

I was puzzled by this. If he had decided to renounce this mysterious other girlâ€”whether out of fear of his mother, or for some other reasonâ€”then what was stopping him from going through with the marriage to Lizzie?

â€œThe other girlâ€”is she by chance from Hillsboro?â€ Things were coming a little clearer. When I had first met him and his family at the Gathering, his sisters had exchanged knowing glances at mention of Manfredâ€™s visits to Hillsboro. They had known about it then, even if Ute had not.

â€œAye. Thatâ€™s why I went to Hillsboroâ€”I mean, I had to go, for the . . . er . . . But I meant to see . . . Myra . . . and tell her that I would be married to Miss Wemyss and couldna come to see her anymore.â€

â€œMyra.â€ So she had a name, at least. I sat back, tapping my foot meditatively. â€œYou meant toâ€”so you didnâ€™t see her, after all?â€

He shook his head again, and I saw a tear drop and spread suddenly on the dusty homespun of his breeches.

â€œNo, maâ€™am,â€ he said, his voice half-choked. â€œI couldnâ€™t. She was dead.â€

â€œOh, dear,â€ I said softly. â€œOh, I am so sorry.â€ The tears were falling on his knees, making spots on the cloth, and his shoulders shook, but he didnâ€™t make a sound.

I reached out and gathered him into my arms, holding him tight against my shoulder. His hair was soft and springy and his skin flushed with heat against my neck. I felt helpless to deal with his grief; he was too old to comfort with mere touch, too youngâ€”perhapsâ€”to find any solace in words. There was nothing I could do for the moment save hold him.

His arms went round my waist, though, and he clung to me for several minutes after his weeping was spent. I held him quietly, patting his back and keeping watch through the flickering green shadows of the vine-twined palisades, lest anyone else come looking for me in the garden.

At last he sighed, let go, and sat up. I groped for a handkerchief, and not finding one, pulled off my apron and handed it to him to wipe his face.

â€œYou neednâ€™t marry right away,â€ I said, when he seemed to have regained possession of himself. â€œItâ€™s only right that you should take a little time toâ€”to heal. But we can find some excuse to put the wedding off; Iâ€™ll speak to Jamieâ€”â€

But he was shaking his head, a look of sad determination taking the place of tears.

â€œNo, maâ€™am,â€ he said, low-voiced but definite. â€œI canâ€™t.â€

â€œWhy not?â€

â€œMyra was a whore, maâ€™am. She died of the French disease.â€

He looked up at me then, and I saw the terror in his eyes, behind the grief.

â€œAnd I think Iâ€™ve got it.â€



â€œYEâ€™RE SURE?â€ Jamie set down the hoof he had been trimming, and looked bleakly at Manfred.

â€œIâ€™m sure,â€ I said tartly. I had obliged Manfred to show me the evidenceâ€”in fact, I had taken scrapings from the lesion to examine microscopicallyâ€”then took him straight to find Jamie, barely waiting for the boy to do up his breeches.

Jamie looked fixedly at Manfred, plainly trying to decide what to say. Manfred, purple-faced from the double stress of confession and examination, dropped his own eyes before this basilisk gaze, staring at a crescent of black hoof paring that lay on the ground.

â€œIâ€™m that sorry, sir,â€ he murmured. â€œIâ€”I didna mean to . . .â€

â€œI shouldna suppose anyone does,â€ Jamie said. He breathed deeply and made a sort of subterranean growling noise that caused Manfred to hunch his shoulders and try to withdraw his head, turtlelike, into the safer confines of his clothing.

â€œHe did do the right thing,â€ I pointed out, trying to put the best face possible on the situation. â€œNow, I meanâ€”telling the truth.â€

Jamie snorted.

â€œWell, he couldna be poxing wee Lizzie, now, could he? Thatâ€™s worse than only going wiâ€™ a whore.â€

â€œI suppose some men would just keep quiet about it, and hope for the best.â€

â€œAye, some would.â€ He narrowed his eyes at Manfred, evidently looking for overt indications that Manfred might be a villain of this description.

Gideon, who disliked having his feet messed about and was consequently in bad temper, stamped heavily, narrowly missing Jamieâ€™s own foot. He tossed his head, and emitted a rumbling noise that I thought was roughly the equivalent of Jamieâ€™s growl.

â€œAye, well.â€ Jamie left off glaring at Manfred, and grabbed Gideonâ€™s halter. â€œGo along to the house with him, Sassenach. Iâ€™ll finish here, and then weâ€™ll have Joseph in and see whatâ€™s to do.â€

â€œAll right.â€ I hesitated, unsure whether to speak in front of Manfred. I didnâ€™t want to raise his hopes too much, until Iâ€™d had a chance to look at the scrapings under the microscope.

The spirochetes of syphilis were very distinctive, but I didnâ€™t think I had a stain that would allow me to see them with a simple light microscope such as mine was. And while I thought my homemade penicillin could likely eliminate the infection, I would have no way of knowing for certain, unless I could see them, and then see that they had disappeared from his blood.

I contented myself with saying, â€œI have got penicillin, mind.â€

â€œI ken that well enough, Sassenach.â€ Jamie switched his baleful look from Manfred to me. Iâ€™d saved his life with the penicillinâ€”twiceâ€”but he hadnâ€™t enjoyed the process. With a Scottish noise of dismissal, he bent and picked up Gideonâ€™s enormous hoof again.

Manfred seemed a bit shell-shocked, and said nothing on the way to the house. He hesitated at the door to the surgery, glancing uneasily from the gleaming microscope to the open box of surgical tools, and then toward the covered bowls lined up on the counter, in which I grew my penicillin colonies.

â€œCome in,â€ I said, but was obliged to reach out and take him by the sleeve before he would step across the threshold. It occurred to me that he hadnâ€™t been to the surgery before; it was a good five miles to the McGillivraysâ€™ place, and Frau McGillivray was entirely capable of dealing with her familyâ€™s minor ills.

I wasnâ€™t feeling terribly charitable toward Manfred at the moment, but gave him a stool and asked if he would like a cup of coffee. I thought he could probably use a stiff drink, if he was about to have an interview with Jamie and Joseph Wemyss, but supposed I had better keep him clear-headed.

â€œNo, maâ€™am,â€ he said, and swallowed, white-faced. â€œI mean, thank ye, no.â€

He looked extremely young, and very frightened.

â€œRoll up your sleeve then, please. Iâ€™m going to draw a bit of blood, but it wonâ€™t hurt much. How did you come to meet the, er, young lady? Myra, that was her name?â€

â€œAye, maâ€™am.â€ Tears welled in his eyes at her name; I suppose he really had loved her, poor boyâ€”or thought he had.

He had met Myra in a tavern in Hillsboro. She had seemed kind, he said, and was very pretty, and when she asked the young gunsmith to buy her a glass of geneva, he had obliged, feeling dashing.

â€œSo we drank a bit together, and she laughed at me, and . . .â€ He seemed rather at a loss to explain how matters had progressed from there, but he had waked up in her bed. That had sealed the matter, so far as he was concerned, and he had seized every excuse to go to Hillsboro thereafter.

â€œHow long did this affair go on?â€ I asked, interested. Lacking a decent syringe for drawing blood, Iâ€™d merely pierced the vein inside his elbow with a fleam, and drained off the welling blood into a small vial.

For the better part of two years, apparently.

â€œI kent I couldna wed her,â€ he explained earnestly. â€œMeine Mutter would never . . .â€ He trailed off, assuming the look of a startled rabbit hearing hounds in its immediate vicinity. â€œGruss Gott!â€ he said. â€œMy mother!â€

Iâ€™d been wondering about that particular aspect of the affair myself. Ute McGillivray wasnâ€™t going to be at all pleased to hear that her pride and joy, her only son, had contracted a disreputable disease, and furthermore, one which was about to lead to the breaking of his carefully engineered engagement and very likely to a scandal that the entire backcountry would hear about. The fact that it was generally a fatal disease would probably be a secondary concern.

â€œSheâ€™ll kill me!â€ he said, sliding off his stool and rolling his sleeve down hastily.

â€œProbably not,â€ I said mildly. â€œThough I supposeâ€”â€

At this fraught moment came the sound of the back door opening and voices in the kitchen. Manfred stiffened, dark curls quivering with alarm. Then heavy footsteps started down the hall toward the surgery, and he dived across the room, flung a leg across the windowsill, and was off, running like a deer for the trees.

â€œCome back here, you ass!â€ I bellowed through the open window.

â€œWhich ass is that, Auntie?â€ I turned to see that the heavy footsteps belonged to Young Ianâ€”heavy, because he was carrying Lizzie Wemyss in his arms.

â€œLizzie! Whatâ€™s the matter? Here, put her on the table.â€ I could see at once what the matter was: a return of the malarial fever. She was limp, but shivered nonetheless with chill, the contracting muscles shaking her like jelly.

â€œI found her in the dairy shed,â€ Ian said, laying her gently on the table. â€œThe deaf Beardsley came rushinâ€™ out as though the devil was chasing him, saw me, and dragged me in. She was on the floor, wiâ€™ the churn overturned beside her.â€

This was very worryingâ€”she hadnâ€™t had an attack for some time, but for a second time, the attack had come upon her too suddenly for her to go for help, causing almost immediate collapse.

â€œTop shelf of the cupboard,â€ I said to Ian, hastily rolling Lizzie on her side and undoing her laces. â€œThat bluish jarâ€”no, the big one.â€

He grabbed it without question, removing the lid as he brought it to me.

â€œJesus, Auntie! Whatâ€™s that?â€ He wrinkled his nose at the smell from the ointment.

â€œGallberries and cinchona bark in goose grease, among other things. Take some and start rubbing it into her feet.â€

Looking bemused, he gingerly scooped up a dollop of the purplish-gray cream and did as I said, Lizzieâ€™s small bare foot nearly disappearing between the large palms of his hands.

â€œWill she be all right, dâ€™ye think, Auntie?â€ He glanced at her face, looking troubled. The look of her was enough to trouble anyoneâ€”the clammy color of whey, and the flesh gone slack so that her delicate cheeks juddered with the chills.

â€œProbably. Close your eyes, Ian.â€ Iâ€™d got her clothes loosened, and now pulled off her gown, petticoats, pocket, and stays. I threw a ratty blanket over her before working the shift off over her headâ€”she owned only two, and wouldnâ€™t want one spoiled with the reek of the ointment.

Ian had obediently closed his eyes, but was still rubbing the ointment methodically into her feet, a small frown drawing his brows together, the look of concern lending him for a moment a brief but startling resemblance to Jamie.

I drew the jar toward me, scooped up some ointment, and, reaching under the blanket, began to rub it into the thinner skin beneath her armpits, then over her back and belly. I could feel the outlines of her liver distinctly, a large, firm mass beneath her ribs. Swollen, and tender from the way she grimaced at my touch; there was some ongoing damage there, certainly.

â€œCan I open my eyes now?â€

â€œOhâ€”yes, of course. Rub more up her legs, please, Ian.â€ Shoving the jar back in his direction, I caught a glimpse of movement in the doorway. One of the Beardsley twins stood there, clinging to the jamb, dark eyes fixed on Lizzie. Kezzie, it must be; Ian had said â€œthe deaf Beardsleyâ€ had come to fetch help.

â€œSheâ€™ll be all right,â€ I said to him, raising my voice, and he nodded once, then disappeared, with a single burning glance at Ian.

â€œWho was it ye were shouting at, Auntie Claire?â€ Ian looked up at me, clearly as much to preserve Lizzieâ€™s modesty as from courtesy to me; the blanket was turned back and his big hands were smoothing ointment into the skin above her knee, thumbs gently circling the small rounded curves of her patella, her skin so thin that the pearly bone seemed almost visible through it.

â€œWhoâ€”oh. Manfred McGillivray,â€ I said, suddenly recollecting. â€œDamn! The blood!â€ I leapt up and wiped my hands hurriedly on my apron. Thank God, Iâ€™d corked the vial; the blood inside was still liquid. It wouldnâ€™t keep long, though.

â€œDo her hands and arms, would you please, Ian? Iâ€™ve got to manage this quickly.â€

He moved obligingly to do as I said, while I hastily spilled a drop of blood on each of several slides, dragging a clean slide across each one to make a smear. What sort of stain might work on spirochetes? No telling; Iâ€™d try them all.

I explained the matter disjointedly to Ian, as I pulled stain bottles out of the cupboard, made up the solutions, and set the slides to soak.

â€œThe pox? Poor lad; he must be nearly mad wiâ€™ fright.â€ He eased Lizzieâ€™s arm, gleaming with ointment, under the blanket and tucked it gently round her.

I was momentarily surprised at this show of sympathy, but then remembered. Ian had been exposed to syphilis some years before, after his abduction by Geillis Duncan; I hadnâ€™t been sure that he had the disease, but had dosed him with the last of my twentieth-century penicillin, just in case.

â€œDid ye not tell him ye could cure him, though, Auntie?â€

â€œI hadnâ€™t the chance. Though Iâ€™m not absolutely sure that I can, to be honest.â€ I sat down on a stool, and took Lizzieâ€™s other hand, feeling for her pulse.

â€œYeâ€™re not?â€ His feathery brows went up at that. â€œYe told me I was cured.â€

â€œYou are,â€ I assured him. â€œIf you ever had the disease in the first place.â€ I gave him a sharp look. â€œYouâ€™ve never had a sore on your prick, have you? Or anywhere else?â€

He shook his head, mute, a dark wave of blood staining his lean cheeks.

â€œGood. But the penicillin I gave youâ€”that was some that Iâ€™d brought from . . . well, from before. That was purifiedâ€”very strong and certainly potent. Iâ€™m never sure, when I use this stuffâ€â€”I gestured at the culturing bowls on the counterâ€”â€œwhether itâ€™s strong enough to work, or even the right strain. . . .â€ I rubbed the back of my hand under my nose; the gallberry ointment, had a most penetrating smell.

â€œIt doesnâ€™t always work.â€ I had had more than one patient with an infection that didnâ€™t respond to one of my penicillin concoctionsâ€”though in those cases, I had often succeeded with another attempt. In a few instances, the person had recovered on his own before the second brew was ready. In one instance, the patient had died, despite applications of two different penicillin mixtures.

Ian nodded slowly, his eyes on Lizzieâ€™s face. The first bout of chills had spent itself and she lay quiet, the blanket barely moving over the slight round of her chest.

â€œIf yeâ€™re no sure, then . . . yeâ€™d not let him marry her, surely?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know. Jamie said heâ€™d speak to Mr. Wemyss, see what he thought of the matter.â€

I rose and took the first of the slides from its pinkish bath, shook off the clinging drops, and, wiping the bottom of the slide, placed it carefully on the platform of my microscope.

â€œWhat are ye looking for, Auntie?â€

â€œThings called spirochetes. Those are the particular kind of germ that causes syphilis.â€

â€œOh, aye.â€ Despite the seriousness of the situation, I smiled, hearing the note of skepticism in his voice. Iâ€™d shown him microorganisms before, butâ€”like Jamieâ€”like almost everyoneâ€”he simply couldnâ€™t believe that something so nearly invisible was capable of harm. The only one who had seemed to accept the notion wholeheartedly was Malva Christie, and in her case, I thought the acceptance was due simply to her faith in me. If I told her something, she believed me; very refreshing, after years of assorted Scots looking at me with varying degrees of squiggle-eyed suspicion.

â€œHas he gone home, dâ€™ye think? Manfred?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ I spoke absently, slowly moving the slide to and fro, searching. I could make out the red blood cells, pale pink discs that floated past my field of view, drifting lazily in the watery stain. No deadly spirals visibleâ€”but that didnâ€™t mean they werenâ€™t there, only that the stain I had used might not reveal them.

Lizzie stirred and moaned, and I looked round to see her eyes flutter open.

â€œThere, lass,â€ Ian said softly, and smiled at her. â€œBetter, is it?â€

â€œIs it?â€ she said faintly. Still, the corners of her mouth lifted slightly, and she put a hand out from under her blanket, groping. He took it in his, patting it.

â€œManfred,â€ she said, turning her head to and fro, eyes half-lidded. â€œIs Manfred here?â€

â€œUm . . . no,â€ I said, exchanging a quick glance of consternation with Ian. How much had she heard? â€œNo, he was here, but heâ€™sâ€”heâ€™s gone now.â€

â€œOh.â€ Seeming to lose interest, she closed her eyes again. Ian looked down at her, still stroking her hand. His face showed deep sympathyâ€”with perhaps a tinge of calculation.

â€œShall I maybe carry the lassie up to her bed?â€ he asked softly, as though she might be sleeping. â€œAnd then maybe go and find . . . ?â€ He tilted his head toward the open window, raising one eyebrow.

â€œIf you would, please, Ian.â€ I hesitated, and his eyes met mine, deep hazel and soft with worry and the shadow of remembered pain. â€œSheâ€™ll be all right,â€ I said, trying to infuse a sense of certainty into the words.

â€œAye, she will,â€ he said firmly, and stooped to gather her up, tucking the blanket under her. â€œIf Iâ€™ve anything to say about it.â€

IN WHICH THINGS

GANG AGLEY




MANFRED MCGILLIVRAY did not come back. Ian did, with a blackened eye, skinned knuckles, and the terse report that Manfred had declared a set intention of going off and hanging himself, and good riddance to the fornicating son of a bitch, and might his rotten bowels gush forth like Judas Iscariotâ€™s, the traitorous, stinking wee turd. He then stamped upstairs, to stand silent over Lizzieâ€™s bed for a time.

Hearing this, I hoped that Manfredâ€™s statement was merely the counsel of temporary despairâ€”and cursed myself for not having told him at once and in the strongest terms that he could be cured, whether it was absolutely true or not. Surely he wouldnâ€™t . . .

Lizzie was half-conscious, prostrated with the burning fevers and shaking agues of malaria, and in no fit state to be told of her betrothedâ€™s desertion, nor the cause of it. I would have to make some delicate inquiries, though, so soon as she was fit, because there was the possibility that she and Manfred had anticipated their marriage vows, and if so . . .

â€œWell, thereâ€™s the one thing about it,â€ Jamie observed grimly. â€œThe Beardsley twins were making ready to track our poxed lad down and castrate him, but now theyâ€™ve heard he means to hang himself, theyâ€™ve magnanimously decided that will do.â€

â€œThank the Lord for small blessings,â€ I said, sinking down at the table. â€œThey might really do it.â€ The Beardsleys, particularly Josiah, were excellent trackersâ€”and not given to idle threats.

â€œOh, they would,â€ Jamie assured me. â€œThey were most seriously sharpening their knives when I found them at it and told them not to trouble themselves.â€

I suppressed an involuntary smile at the image of the Beardsleys, bent side by side over a grindstone, their lean, dark faces set in identical scowls of vengeance, but the momentary flash of humor faded.

â€œOh, God. Weâ€™ll have to tell the McGillivrays.â€

Jamie nodded, looking pale at the thought, but pushed back his bench.

â€œIâ€™d best go straightaway.â€

â€œNot â€™til yeâ€™ve had a bite.â€ Mrs. Bug put a plate of food firmly in front of him. â€œYe dinna want to be dealing wiâ€™ Ute McGillivray on an empty stomach.â€

Jamie hesitated, but evidently found her argument to have merit, for he picked up his fork and addressed himself to the ragooâ€™d pork with grim determination.

â€œJamie . . .â€

â€œAye?â€

â€œPerhaps you should let the Beardsleys track Manfred down. Not to hurt him, I donâ€™t meanâ€”but we need to find him. He will die of it, if he isnâ€™t treated.â€

He paused, a forkful of ragoo halfway to his mouth, and regarded me under lowered brows.

â€œAye, and if they find him, heâ€™ll die of that, Sassenach.â€ He shook his head, and the fork completed its journey. He chewed and swallowed, evidently completing his plan as he did so.

â€œJosephâ€™s in Bethabara, courting. Heâ€™ll have to be told, and by rights, I should fetch him to go with me to the McGillivraysâ€™. But . . .â€ He hesitated, clearly envisioning Mr. Wemyss, that mildest and shyest of men, and no oneâ€™s notion of a useful ally. â€œNo. Iâ€™ll go and tell Robin. May be as heâ€™ll start searching for the lad himselfâ€”or Manfred may have thought better of it and run for home already.â€

That was a cheering thought, and I saw him off with hope in mind. But he returned near midnight, grim-faced and silent, and I knew that Manfred had not come home.

â€œYou told them both?â€ I asked, turning back the coverlet for him to crawl in beside me. He smelled of horse and night, cool and pungent.

â€œI asked Robin to walk outside wiâ€™ me, and told him. I hadna the nerve to tell Ute to her face,â€ he admitted. He smiled at me, snuggling under the quilt. â€œYe dinna think me too much a coward, I hope, Sassenach.â€

â€œNo, indeed,â€ I assured him, and leaned to blow out the candle. â€œDiscretion is the better part of valor.â€



WE WERE ROUSED just before dawn by a thunderous pounding on the door. Rollo, who had been sleeping on the landing, shot down the stair, roaring threats. He was closely followed by Ian, who had been sitting up by Lizzieâ€™s bed, keeping watch while I slept. Jamie leapt out of bed and, seizing a loaded pistol from the top of the wardrobe, rushed to join the fray.

Shocked and dazedâ€”I had been asleep for less than an hourâ€”I sat up, heart pounding. Rollo stopped barking for a moment, and I heard Jamie shout, â€œWho is it?â€ through the door.

This query was answered by a renewed pounding that echoed up the stairwell and seemed to shake the house, accompanied by an upraised feminine voice that would have done credit to Wagner in one of his more robust moods. Ute McGillivray.

I began to struggle out of the bedclothes. Meanwhile, a confusion of voices, renewed barking, the grate of the bolt being liftedâ€”and then more confused voices, all much louder. I ran to the window and looked out; Robin McGillivray was standing in the dooryard, having evidently just dismounted from one of a pair of mules.

He looked much older, and somehow deflated, as though the spirit had gone out of him, taking all his strength and leaving him flabby. He turned his head away from whatever riot was taking place on the stoop, closing his eyes. The sun was just up now, and the pure clear light showed up all the lines and hollows of exhaustion and a desperate unhappiness.

As though he sensed me looking at him, he opened his eyes and raised his face toward the window. He was red-eyed, disheveled. He saw me, but didnâ€™t respond to my tentative wave of greeting. Instead, he turned away, closing his eyes again, and stood, waiting.

The riot below had moved inside, and appeared to be progressing up the stairs, borne on a wave of Scottish expostulations and Germanic shrieks, punctuated by enthusiastic barking from Rollo, always willing to lend his efforts to further the festivities.

I seized my wrapper from its peg, but had barely got one arm into it before the door of the bedchamber was flung open, crashing into the wall so hard that it rebounded and hit her in the chest. Nothing daunted, she slammed it open again and advanced on me like a juggernaut, cap awry and eyes blazing.

â€œYou! Weibchen! How you dare, such insult, such lies to say my son about! You I kill, I tear off your hair, nighean na galladh! Youâ€”â€

She lunged at me and I flung myself sideways, narrowly avoiding her grab at my arm.

â€œUte! Frau McGillivray! Listen toâ€”â€

The second grab was more successful; she got hold of the sleeve of my night rail and wrenched, dragging the garment off my shoulder with a rending noise of torn cloth, even as she clawed at my face with her free hand.

I jerked back, and screamed with all my strength, my nerves recalling for one dreadful instant a hand striking at my face, hands pulling at me. . . .

I struck at her, the strength of terror flooding through my limbs, screaming, screaming, some tiny remnant of rationality in my brain watching this, bemused, appalledâ€”but completely unable to stop the animal panic, the unreasoning rage that geysered up from some deep and unsuspected well.

I hit out, hammering blindly, screamingâ€”wondering even as I did so, why, why was I doing this?

An arm grabbed me round the waist and I was lifted off the ground. A fresh spurt of panic ripped through me, and then I found myself suddenly alone, untouched. I was standing in the corner by the wardrobe, swaying drunkenly, panting. Jamie stood in front of me, shoulders braced and elbows raised, shielding me.

He was talking, very calmly, but I had lost the capacity to make sense of words. I pressed my hands back against the wall, and felt some sense of comfort from its solid bulk.

My heart was still hammering in my ears, the sound of my own breathing scaring me, it was so like the gasping sound when Harley Boble had broken my nose. I shut my mouth hard, trying to stop. Holding my breath seemed to work, allowing only small inhalations through my now-functioning nose.

The movement of Uteâ€™s mouth caught my eye and I stared at it, trying to fix myself once more in time and space. I was hearing words, but couldnâ€™t quite make the jump of comprehension. I breathed, letting the words flow over me like water, taking emotion from themâ€”anger, reason, protest, placation, shrillness, growlingâ€”but no explicit meaning.

Then I took a deep breath, wiped my faceâ€”I was surprised to find it wetâ€”and suddenly everything snapped back to normal. I could hear, and understand.

Ute was staring at me, anger and dislike clear on her face, but muted by a lurking horror.

â€œYou are mad,â€ she said, nodding. â€œI see.â€ She sounded almost calm at this point. â€œWell, then.â€

She turned to Jamie, automatically twisting up untidy handsful of grizzled blond hair, stuffing them under her enormous cap. The ribbon had been torn; a loop of it dangled absurdly over one eye.

â€œSo, she is mad. I will say so, but still, my sonâ€”my son!â€”is gone. So.â€ She stood heaving, surveying me, and shook her head, then turned again to Jamie.

â€œSalem is closed to you,â€ she said curtly. â€œMy family, those who know usâ€”they will not trade with you. Nor anyone else I speak to, to tell them the wicked thing she has done.â€ Her eye drifted back to me, a cold, gelid blue, and her lip curled in a heavy sneer under the loop of torn ribbon.

â€œYou are shunned,â€ she said. â€œYou do not exist, you.â€ She turned on her heel and walked out, forcing Ian and Rollo to sidestep hastily out of her way. Her footfalls echoed heavily on the stair, a ponderous, measured tread, like the tolling of a passing bell.

I saw the tension in Jamieâ€™s shoulders relax, little by little. He was still wearing his nightshirtâ€”there was a damp patch between his shoulder bladesâ€”and had the pistol still in his hand.

The front door boomed shut below. Everyone stood still, struck silent.

â€œYou wouldnâ€™t really have shot her, would you?â€ I asked, clearing my throat.

â€œWhat?â€ He turned, staring at me. Then he caught the direction of my glance, and looked at the pistol in his hand as though wondering where that had come from.

â€œOh,â€ he said, â€œno,â€ and shook his head, reaching up to put it back on top of the wardrobe. â€œI forgot I had it. Though God kens well enough that I should like to shoot the besotted auld besom,â€ he added. â€œAre ye all right, Sassenach?â€

He stooped to look at me, his eyes soft with worry.

â€œIâ€™m all right. I donâ€™t know whatâ€”but itâ€™s all right. Itâ€™s gone now.â€

â€œAh,â€ he said softly, and looked away, lashes coming down to hide his eyes. Had he felt it, too, then? Found himself suddenly . . . back? I knew he had sometimes. Remembered waking from sleep in Paris to see him braced in an open window, pressing so hard against the frame that the muscles stood out in his arms, visible by moonlight.

â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ I repeated, touching him, and he gave me a brief, shy smile.

â€œYe should have bitten her,â€ Ian was saying earnestly to Rollo. â€œSheâ€™s got an arse the size of a hogshead of tobaccoâ€”how could ye miss?â€

â€œProbably afraid of being poisoned,â€ I said, coming out of my corner. â€œDo you suppose she meant itâ€”or no, she meant it, certainly. But do you suppose she can do it? Stop anyone trading with us, I mean.â€

â€œShe can stop Robin,â€ Jamie said, a certain grimness returning to his expression. â€œFor the rest . . . weâ€™ll see.â€

Ian shook his head, frowning, and rubbed his knuckled fist gingerly against his thigh.

â€œI kent I should have broken Manfredâ€™s neck,â€ he said with real regret. â€œWe could haâ€™ told Frau Ute he fell off a rock, and saved a deal of trouble.â€

â€œManfred?â€ The small voice made everyone turn as one, to see who had spoken.

Lizzie stood in the doorway, thin and pale as a starveling ghost, her eyes huge and glassy with recent fever.

â€œWhat about Manfred?â€ she said. She swayed dangerously, and put out a hand to the jamb, to save herself falling. â€œWhatâ€™s happened to him?â€

â€œPoxed and gone,â€ Ian said curtly, drawing himself up. â€œYe didna give him your maidenheid, I hope.â€



IN THE EVENT, Ute McGillivray was not quite able to fulfill her threatâ€”but she did enough damage. Manfredâ€™s dramatic disappearance, the breaking of his engagement to Lizzie, and the reason for it was a fearful scandal, and word of it spread from Hillsboro and Salisbury, where he had worked now and then as an itinerant gunsmith, to Salem and High Point.

But thanks to Uteâ€™s efforts, the story was even more confused than would be normal for such gossip; some said that he was poxed, others that I had maliciously and falsely accused him of being poxed, because of some fancied disagreement with his parents. Others, more kindly, did not believe Manfred was poxed, but said that doubtless I had been mistaken.

Those who believed him to be poxed were divided as to how he had achieved that condition, half of them convinced that he had got it from some whore, and a good many of the rest speculating that he had got it from poor Lizzie, whose reputation suffered terriblyâ€”until Ian, Jamie, the Beardsley twins, and even Roger took to defending her honor with their fists, at which point people did not, of course, stop talkingâ€”but stopped talking where any of her champions might hear directly.

All of Uteâ€™s numerous relatives in and around Wachovia, Salem, Bethabara, and Bethania of course believed her version of the story, and tongues wagged busily. All of Salem did not cease trading with usâ€”but many people did. And more than once, I had the unnerving experience of greeting Moravians I knew well, only to have them stare past me in stony silence, or turn their backs upon me. Often enough that I no longer went to Salem.

Lizzie, beyond a certain initial mortification, seemed not terribly upset at the rupture of her engagement. Bewildered, confused, and sorryâ€”she saidâ€”for Manfred, but not desolated by his loss. And since she seldom left the Ridge anymore, she didnâ€™t hear what people said about her. What did trouble her was the loss of the McGillivraysâ€”particularly Ute.

â€œDâ€™ye see, maâ€™am,â€ she told me wistfully, â€œIâ€™d never had a mother, for my own died when I was born. And then Muttiâ€”she asked me to call her so when I said Iâ€™d marry Manfredâ€”she said I was her daughter, just like Hilda and Inga and Senga. Sheâ€™d fuss over me, and bully me and laugh at me, just as she did them. And it was . . . just so nice, to have all that family. And now Iâ€™ve lost them.â€

Robin, who had been sincerely attached to her, had sent her a short, regretful note, sneaked out through the good offices of Ronnie Sinclair. But since Manfredâ€™s disappearance, neither Ute nor the girls had come to see her, nor sent a single word.

It was Joseph Wemyss, though, who was most visibly affected by the affair. He said nothing, plainly not wishing to make matters worse for Lizzieâ€”but he drooped, like a flower deprived of rain. Beyond his pain for Lizzie, and his distress at the blackening of her reputation, he, too, missed the McGillivrays, missed the joy and comfort of suddenly being part of a large, exuberant family, after so many years of loneliness.

Worse, though, was that while Ute had not been able to carry out her threat entirely, she had been able to influence her near relativesâ€”including Pastor Berrisch, and his sister, Monika, who, Jamie told me privately, had been forbidden to see or speak to Joseph again.

â€œThe Pastorâ€™s sent her away to his wifeâ€™s relatives in Halifax,â€ he said, shaking his head sadly. â€œTo forget.â€

â€œOh, dear.â€

And of Manfred, there was no slightest trace. Jamie had sent word through all his usual avenues, but no one had seen him since his flight from the Ridge. I thought of himâ€”and prayed for himâ€”daily, haunted by pictures of him skulking in the woods alone, the deadly spirochetes multiplying in his blood day by day. Or, much worse, working his way to the Indies on some ship, pausing in every port to drown his sorrows in the arms of unsuspecting whores, to whom he would pass on the silent, fatal infectionâ€”and they, in turn . . .

Or sometimes, the nightmare image of a bundle of rotting clothes hanging from a tree limb, deep in the forest, with no mourners save the crows who came to pick the flesh from his bones. And despite everything, I could not find it in my heart to hate Ute McGillivray, who must be thinking the same thoughts.

The sole bright spot in this ruddy quagmire was that Thomas Christie, quite contrary to my expectations, had allowed Malva to continue to come to the surgery, his sole stipulation being that if I proposed to involve his daughter in any further use of the ether, he was to be told ahead of time.

â€œThere.â€ I stood back, gesturing to her to look through the eyepiece of the microscope. â€œDo you see them?â€

Her lips pursed in silent fascination. It had taken no little effort to find a combination of staining and reflected sunlight that would reveal the spirochetes, but I had succeeded at last. They werenâ€™t strongly visible, but you could see them, if you knew what you were looking forâ€”and despite my complete conviction in my original diagnosis, I was relieved to see them.

â€œOh, yes! Wee spirals. I see them plain!â€ She looked up at me, blinking. â€œDâ€™ye mean seriously to tell me that these bittie things are whatâ€™s poxed Manfred?â€ She was too polite to express open skepticism, but I could see it in her eyes.

â€œI do indeed.â€ I had explained the germ theory of disease a number of times, to a variety of disbelieving eighteenth-century listeners, and in the light of this experience had little expectation of finding a favorable reception. The normal response was either a blank stare, indulgent laughter, or a sniff of dismissal, and I was more or less expecting a polite version of one of these reactions from Malva.

To my surprise, though, she seemed to grasp the notion at onceâ€”or at least pretended to.

â€œWell, so.â€ She put both hands on the counter and peered again at the spirochetes. â€œThese wee beasties cause the syphilis, then. However do they do that? And why is it that the bittie things ye showed me from my teeth donâ€™t make me ill?â€

I explained, as best I could, the notion of â€œgood bugsâ€ or â€œindifferent bugsâ€ versus â€œbad bugs,â€ which she seemed to grasp easilyâ€”but my explanation of cells, and the concept of the body being composed of these, left her frowning at the palm of her hand in confusion, trying to make out the individual cells. She shook off her doubt, though, and folding up her hand in her apron, returned to her questions.

Did the bugs cause all disease? The penicillinâ€”why did it work on some of the germs, but not all? And how did the bugs get from one person to another?

â€œSome travel by airâ€”thatâ€™s why you must try to avoid people coughing or sneezing on youâ€”and some by waterâ€”which is why you mustnâ€™t drink from a stream that someoneâ€™s been using as a privyâ€”and some . . . well, by other means.â€ I didnâ€™t know how much she might know about sex in humansâ€”she lived on a farm, clearly she knew how pigs, chickens, and horses behavedâ€”and I was wary of enlightening her, lest her father hear about it. I rather thought heâ€™d prefer her to be dealing with ether.

Naturally, she pounced on my evasion.

â€œOther means? What other means are there?â€ With an internal sigh, I told her.

â€œThey do what?â€ she said, incredulous. â€œMen, I mean. Like an animal! Whyever would a woman let a man do that to her?â€

â€œWell, they are animals, you know,â€ I said, suppressing an urge to laugh. â€œSo are women. As to why one would let them . . .â€ I rubbed my nose, looking for a tasteful way of putting it. She was moving rapidly ahead of me, though, putting two and two together.

â€œFor money,â€ she said, looking thunderstruck. â€œThatâ€™s what a whore does! She lets them do such things to her for money.â€

â€œWell, yesâ€”but women who arenâ€™t whoresâ€”â€

â€œThe bairns, aye, ye said.â€ She nodded, but was plainly thinking of other things; her small, smooth forehead was wrinkled in concentration.

â€œHow much money do they get?â€ she asked. â€œI should want a lot, I think, to let a manâ€”â€

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I said, somewhat taken aback. â€œDifferent amounts, I expect. Depending.â€

â€œDepending . . . oh, if he was maybe ugly, ye mean, ye could make him pay more? Or if she were ugly . . .â€ She gave me a quick, interested look. â€œBobby Higgins told me of a whore he kent in London, that her looks was spoilt by vitriol.â€ She looked up at the cupboard where I kept the sulfuric acid under lock and key, and shivered, her delicate shoulders quivering with revulsion at the thought.

â€œYes, he told me about her, too. Vitriol is what we call a causticâ€”a liquid that burns. Thatâ€™s whyâ€”â€

But her mind had already returned to the subject of fascination.

â€œTo think of Manfred McGillivray doing such a thing!â€ She turned round gray eyes on me. â€œWell, and Bobby. He must have been, mustnâ€™t he?â€

â€œI do believe soldiers are inclinedâ€”â€

â€œBut the Bible,â€ she said, squinting thoughtfully. â€œIt says ye mustna be whoring after idols. Does that mean men went about sticking their pricks intoâ€”did the idols look like women, dâ€™ye think?â€

â€œIâ€™m sure thatâ€™s not what it means, no,â€ I said hastily. â€œMore a metaphor, you know. Er . . . lusting after something, I think it means, not, er . . .â€

â€œLust,â€ she said thoughtfully. â€œThatâ€™s to want something sinful bad, is it not?â€

â€œYes, rather.â€ Heat was wavering over my skin, dancing in tiny veils. I needed cool air, quickly, or Iâ€™d be flushed as a tomato and drenched with sweat. I rose to go out, but felt I really mustnâ€™t leave her with the impression that sex had to do only with money or babiesâ€”even though it well might, for some women.

â€œThere is another reason for intercourse, you know,â€ I said, speaking over my shoulder as I headed for the door. â€œWhen you love someone, you want to give them pleasure. And they want to do the same for you.â€

â€œPleasure?â€ Her voice rose behind me, incredulous. â€œYe mean some women like it?â€

BEES AND SWITCHES




I WAS BY NO MEANS SPYING. One of my hives had swarmed, and I was looking for the fugitive bees.

New swarms usually didnâ€™t travel far, and stopped frequently, often resting for hours in a tree fork or open log, where they formed a ball of humming conference. If they could be located before making up their collective mind about where to settle, they could often be persuaded into a temptingly empty basket hive, and thus hauled back into captivity.

The trouble with bees is that they donâ€™t leave footprints. Now I was casting to and fro on the mountainside, nearly a mile from the house, an empty basket hive slung on a rope over my shoulder, trying to follow Jamieâ€™s instructions regarding hunting, and think like a bee.

There were huge blooming patches of galax, fire-weed, and other wildflowers on the hillside far above me, but there was a very attractive dead snagâ€”if one was a beeâ€”poking out of the heavy growth some way below.

The basket hive was heavy, and the slope was steep. It was easier to go down than up. I hitched up the rope, which was beginning to rub the skin off my shoulder, and began sidling downward through sumac and hobble-bush, bracing my feet against rocks and grabbing at branches to keep from slipping.

Concentrating on my feet, I didnâ€™t take particular notice of where I was. I emerged into a gap in the bushes from which the roof of a cabin was visible, some distance below me. Whose was that? The Christiesâ€™, I thought. I wiped a sleeve across the sweat dripping from the point of my chin; the day was warm, and I hadnâ€™t brought a canteen. Perhaps I would stop and ask for water on the way home.

Making my way at last to the snag, I was disappointed to find no sign of the swarm. I stood still, blotting sweat from my face and listening, in hopes of picking up the beesâ€™ telltale deep drone. I heard the hum and whine of assorted flying insects, and the genial racket of a flock of foraging pygmy nuthatches on the slope aboveâ€”but no bees.

I sighed and turned to make my way around the snag, but then paused, my eye caught by a glimpse of white below.

Thomas Christie and Malva were in the small clearing at the back of their cabin. I had caught the flash of his shirt as he moved, but now he stood motionless, arms crossed.

His attention appeared to be fixed on his daughter, who was cutting branches from one of the mountain ash trees at the side of the clearing. What for? I wondered.

There seemed something very peculiar about the scene, though I couldnâ€™t think exactly what. Some attitude of body? Some air of tension between them?

Malva turned and walked toward her father, several long, slender branches in her hand. Her head was bent, her step dragging, and when she handed him the branches, I understood abruptly what was going on.

They were too far away for me to hear them, but he apparently said something to her, gesturing brusquely toward the stump they used as a chopping block. She knelt down by it, bent forward, and lifted up her skirts, exposing her bare buttocks.

Without hesitation, he raised the switches and slashed them hard across her rump, then whipped them back in the other direction, crisscrossing her flesh with vivid lines that I could see even at such a distance. He repeated this several times, whipping the springy twigs back and forth with a measured deliberation whose violence was the more shocking for its lack of apparent emotion.

It hadnâ€™t even occurred to me to look away. I stood stock-still in the shrubbery, too stunned even to brush away the gnats that swarmed around my face.

Christie had thrown down the switches, turned on his heel, and gone into the house before I could do more than blink. Malva sat back on her heels and shook down her skirts, smoothing the fabric gingerly over her bottom as she rose. She was red-faced, but not weeping or distraught.

Sheâ€™s used to it. The thought came unbidden. I hesitated, not knowing what to do. Before I could decide, Malva had settled her cap, turned, and walked into the woods with an air of determinationâ€”headed straight toward me.

I ducked behind a big tulip poplar, before I was even aware of making a decision. She wasnâ€™t injured, and I was sure she wouldnâ€™t like to know that anyone had seen the incident.

Malva passed within a few feet of me, puffing a little on the climb, and snorting through her nose and muttering in a way that made me think she was very angry, rather than upset.

I peered cautiously round the poplar, but caught no more than a glimpse of her cap, bobbing through the trees. There were no cabins up there, and she hadnâ€™t carried a basket or any tools for foraging. Perhaps she only wanted to be alone, to recover herself. No surprise, if so.

I waited until she was safely out of sight, then made my own way slowly down the slope. I didnâ€™t stop at the Christie cabin, thirsty as I was, and had quite lost interest in errant bees.



I MET JAMIE AT a stiled fence, some little distance from home, in conversation with Hiram Crombie. I nodded in greeting, and waited in some impatience for Crombie to finish his business, so I could tell Jamie what I had just witnessed.

Luckily, Hiram showed no inclination to linger; I made him nervous.

I told Jamie at once what I had seen, and was annoyed to find that he didnâ€™t share my concern. If Tom Christie thought it necessary to whip his daughter, that was his affair.

â€œBut he might be . . . it might beâ€”perhaps it doesnâ€™t stop with a switching. Perhaps he does . . . other things to her.â€

He shot me a look of surprise.

â€œTom? Dâ€™ye have any reason to think so?â€

â€œNo,â€ I admitted reluctantly. The Christie mÃ©nage gave me an uncomfortable feeling, but that was likely only because I didnâ€™t get on with Tom. I wasnâ€™t so foolish as to think that a tendency toward Bible-thumping meant a person wouldnâ€™t engage in wickednessâ€”but in all fairness, it didnâ€™t mean he did, either. â€œBut surely he shouldnâ€™t be whipping her like thatâ€”at her age?â€

He glanced at me in mild exasperation.

â€œYe dinna understand a thing, do ye?â€ he said, echoing my thought exactly.

â€œI was about to say just that, to you,â€ I said, giving him look for look. He didnâ€™t look away, but held my gaze, his own slowly taking on a wry amusement.

â€œSo it will be different?â€ he said. â€œIn your world?â€ There was just enough edge in his voice to remind me forcibly that we were not in my worldâ€”nor ever would be. Sudden gooseflesh ran up my arm, lifting the fine blond hairs.

â€œA man wouldna beat a woman, then, in your time? Not even for good cause?â€

And what was I to say to that? I couldnâ€™t lie, even if I wanted to; he knew my face much too well.

â€œSome do,â€ I admitted. â€œBut itâ€™s not the same. Thereâ€”then, I meanâ€”a man who beat his wife would be a criminal. But,â€ I added in fairness, â€œa man who beat his wife then would most often be using his fists.â€

A look of astonished disgust crossed his face.

â€œWhat sort of man would do that?â€ he asked incredulously.

â€œA bad one.â€

â€œSo I should think, Sassenach. And ye dinna think thereâ€™s a difference?â€ he asked. â€œYeâ€™d see it the same, if I were to smash your face, rather than only take a tawse to your bum?â€

Blood flared abruptly in my cheeks. He once had taken a strap to me, and I hadnâ€™t forgotten it. I had wanted to kill him at the timeâ€”and didnâ€™t feel kindly toward him at the memory. At the same time, I wasnâ€™t stupid enough to equate his actions with those of a modern-day wife-beater.

He glanced at me, raised one eyebrow, then understood what I was recalling. He grinned.

â€œOh,â€ he said.

â€œOh, indeed,â€ I said very cross. I had succeeded in putting that extremely humiliating episode out of mind, and didnâ€™t at all like having it recalled.

He, on the other hand, was plainly enjoying the recollection. He eyed me in a manner I found grossly insufferable, still grinning.

â€œGod, ye screamed like a ban-sidhe.â€

I began to feel a distinct throbbing of blood in my temples.

â€œI bloody well had cause to!â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said, and the grin widened. â€œYe did. Your own fault, mind,â€ he added.

â€œMy fâ€”â€

â€œIt was,â€ he said firmly.

â€œYou apologized!â€ I said completely outraged. â€œYou know you did!â€

â€œNo, I didnâ€™t. And it was still your fault to begin with,â€ he said, with complete lack of logic. â€œYe wouldna have got nearly such a wicked tanning, if yeâ€™d only minded me in the first place, when I told ye to kneel andâ€”â€

â€œMinded you! You think I would have just meekly given in and let youâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™ve never seen ye do anything meek, Sassenach.â€ He took my arm to help me over the stile, but I jerked free, puffing with indignation.

â€œYou beastly Scot!â€ I dropped the hive on the ground at his feet, picked up my skirts, and scrambled over the stile.

â€œWell, I havena done it again,â€ he protested, behind me. â€œI promised, aye?â€

I whirled round on the other side and glared at him.

â€œOnly because I threatened to cut your heart out if you ever tried!â€

â€œWell, even so. I could haveâ€”and ye ken that well, Sassenach. Aye?â€ Heâ€™d quit grinning, but there was a distinct glint in his eye.

I took several deep breaths, trying simultaneously to control my annoyance and think of some crushing rejoinder. I failed in both attempts, and with a briefly dignified â€œHmph!â€ turned on my heel.

I heard the rustle of his kilt as he picked up the hive, hopped over the stile, and came after me, catching up within a stride or two. I didnâ€™t look at him; my cheeks were still flaming.

The infuriating fact was that I did know that. I remembered all too well. He had used his sword belt to such effect that I hadnâ€™t been able to sit comfortably for several daysâ€”and if he should ever decide to do it again, there was absolutely nothing to stop him.

I was, for the most part, able to ignore the fact that I was legally his property. That didnâ€™t alter the fact that it was a factâ€”and he knew it.

â€œWhat about Brianna?â€ I demanded. â€œWould you feel the same way about it, if young Roger suddenly decided to take his belt or a switch to your daughter?â€

He appeared to find something amusing in the notion.

â€œI think heâ€™d have the devil of a fight on his hands if he tried,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s a braw wee lassie, no? And she has your notions of what constitutes wifely obedience, Iâ€™m afraid. But then,â€ he added, swinging the hiveâ€™s rope across his shoulder, â€œye never ken what goes on in a marriage, do ye? Perhaps sheâ€™d be pleased if he tried.â€

â€œPleased?!â€ I gawked at him in astonishment. â€œHow can you think that any woman would everâ€”â€

â€œOh, aye? What about my sister?â€

I stopped dead in the middle of the path, staring at him.

â€œWhat about your sister? Surely you arenâ€™t telling meâ€”â€

â€œI am.â€ The glint was back, but I didnâ€™t think he was joking.

â€œIan beat her?â€

â€œI do wish yeâ€™d stop calling it that,â€ he said mildly. â€œIt sounds as though Ian took his fists to her, or blackened her eyes. I gave ye a decent skelping, but I didna bloody ye, for Godâ€™s sake.â€ His eyes flicked briefly toward my face; everything had healed, at least outwardly; the only trace left was a tiny scar through one eyebrowâ€”invisible, unless one parted the hairs there and looked closely. â€œNeither would Ian.â€

I was completely flabbergasted to hear this. I had lived in close proximity with Ian and Jenny Murray for months at a time, and had never seen the slightest indication that he possessed a violent nature. For that matter, it was impossible to imagine anyone trying such a thing on Jenny Murray, who hadâ€”if such a thing was possibleâ€”an even stronger personality than her brother.

â€œWell, what did he do? And why?â€

â€œWell, heâ€™d only take his belt to her now and then,â€ he said, â€œand only if she made him.â€

I took a deep breath.

â€œIf she made him?â€ I asked calmly, under the circumstances.

â€œWell, ye ken Ian,â€ he said, shrugging. â€œHeâ€™s no the one to be doing that sort of thing unless Jenny deviled him into it.â€

â€œI never saw anything of that sort going on,â€ I said, giving him a hard look.

â€œWell, sheâ€™d scarcely do it in front of ye, would she?â€

â€œAnd she would, in front of you?â€

â€œWell, not precisely, no,â€ he admitted. â€œBut I wasna often in the house, after Culloden. Now and then, though, Iâ€™d come down for a visit, and Iâ€™d see that she was . . . brewing for something.â€ He rubbed his nose and squinted against the sun, searching for words. â€œSheâ€™d devil him,â€ he said at last, shrugging. â€œPick at him over nothing, make wee sarcastic remarks. Sheâ€™dâ€”â€ His face cleared a bit, as he came up with a suitable description. â€œSheâ€™d act like a spoilt wee lassie in need of the tawse.â€

I found this description completely incredible. Jenny Murray had a sharp tongue, and few inhibitions about using it on anyone, her husband included. Ian, the soul of good nature, merely laughed at her. But I simply couldnâ€™t countenance the notion of her behaving in the manner described.

â€œWell, so. Iâ€™d seen that a time or two, as I say. And Ian would give her an eye, but held his peace. But then the once, I was out hunting, near sunset, and took a small deer on the hill just behind the brochâ€”ye ken the place?â€

I nodded, still feeling stunned.

â€œIt was close enough to carry the carcass to the house without help, so I brought it down to the smoke shed and hung it. There was no one aboutâ€”I found out later the children had all gone to the market in Broch Mhorda, and the servants with them. So I thought the house was empty altogether, and stepped into the kitchen to find a bite and a cup of buttermilk before I left.â€

Thinking the house empty, he had been startled by noises in the bedchamber overhead.

â€œWhat sort of noises?â€ I asked, fascinated.

â€œWell . . . shrieks,â€ he said, shrugging. â€œAnd giggling. A bit of shoving and banging, with a stool or some such falling over. If it werenâ€™t for the yaffling, I should have thought there were thieves in the house. But I kent it was Jennyâ€™s voice, and Ianâ€™s, andâ€”â€ He broke off, his ears going pink at the memory.

â€œSo then . . . there was a bit moreâ€”raised voices, likeâ€”and then the crack of a belt on a bum, and the sort of skelloch ye could hear across six fields.â€

He took a deep breath, shrugging.

â€œWell, I was taken back a bit, and couldna think what to do at once.â€

I nodded, understanding that, at least.

â€œI expect it would be a bit of an awkward situation, yes. It . . . er . . . went on, though?â€

He nodded. His ears were a deep red by now, and his face flushed, though that might only be from heat.

â€œAye, it did.â€ He glanced at me. â€œMind, Sassenach, if Iâ€™d thought he meant harm to her, I should have been up the stairs in an instant. But . . .â€ He brushed away an inquisitive bee, shaking his head. â€œThere wasâ€”it feltâ€”I canna even think how to say it. It wasna really that Jenny kept laughing, because she didnaâ€”but that I felt she wanted to. And Ian . . . well, Ian was laughing. Not out loud, I dinna mean; it was just . . . in his voice.â€

He blew out his breath, and swiped his knuckles along his jaw, wiping sweat.

â€œI stayed quite frozen there, wiâ€™ a bit of pie in my hand, listening. I came to myself only when the flies started lighting in my open mouth, and by that time, theyâ€™d . . . ah . . . they were . . . mmphm.â€ He hunched his shoulders, as though his shirt were too tight.

â€œMaking it up, were they?â€ I asked very dryly.

â€œI expect so,â€ he replied, rather primly. â€œI left. Walked all the way to Foyne, and stayed the night with Grannie MacNab.â€ Foyne was a tiny hamlet, some fifteen miles from Lallybroch.

â€œWhy?â€ I asked.

â€œWell, I had to,â€ he said logically. â€œI couldna ignore it, after all. It was either walk about and think of things, or else give in and abuse myself, and I couldna verra well do thatâ€”it was my own sister, after all.â€

â€œYou mean to say you canâ€™t think and engage in sexual activity at the same time?â€ I asked, laughing.

â€œOf course not,â€ he saidâ€”thus confirming a long-held private opinion of mineâ€”and gave me a look as though I were crazy. â€œCan you?â€

â€œI can, yes.â€

He raised one eyebrow, plainly unconvinced.

â€œWell, Iâ€™m not saying I do, always,â€ I admitted, â€œbut itâ€™s possible. Women are used to doing more than one thing at onceâ€”they have to, because of the children. Anyway, go back to Jenny and Ian. Why on earthâ€”â€

â€œWell, I did walk about and think of it,â€ Jamie admitted. â€œI couldna seem to stop thinking of it, to be honest. Grannie MacNab could see Iâ€™d something on my mind, and pestered me over the supper until . . . ah . . . well, until I told her about it.â€

â€œReally. What did she say?â€ I asked, fascinated. Iâ€™d known Grannie MacNab, a sprightly old person with a highly forthright mannerâ€”and a lot of experience with human weakness.

â€œShe cackled like thorns under a pot,â€ he said, one side of his mouth turning up. â€œI thought sheâ€™d fall into the fire wiâ€™ merriment.â€

Recovered to some extent, though, the old lady had wiped her eyes and explained matters to him, kindly, as though addressing a simpleton.

â€œShe said it was because of Ianâ€™s leg,â€ Jamie said, glancing at me to see whether this made sense to me. â€œShe said that such a thing would make no difference to Jenny, but it would to him. She said,â€ he added, his color heightening, â€œthat men havena got any idea what women think about bed, but they always think they have, so it causes trouble.â€

â€œI knew I liked Grannie MacNab,â€ I murmured. â€œWhat else?â€

â€œWell, so. She said it was likely that Jenny was only makinâ€™ it clear to Ianâ€”and maybe to herself, as wellâ€”that she still thought he was a man, leg or no.â€

â€œWhat? Why?â€

â€œBecause, Sassenach,â€ he said, very dryly indeed, â€œwhen yeâ€™re a man, a good bit of what ye have to do is to draw up lines and fight other folk who come over them. Your enemies, your tenants, your childrenâ€”your wife. Ye canna always just strike them or take a strap to them, but when ye can, at least itâ€™s clear to everyone whoâ€™s in charge.â€

â€œBut thatâ€™s perfectlyâ€”â€ I began, and then broke off, frowning as I considered this.

â€œAnd if yeâ€™re a man, youâ€™re in charge. Itâ€™s you that keeps order, whether ye like it or not. Itâ€™s true,â€ he said, then touched my elbow as he nodded toward an opening in the wood. â€œIâ€™m thirsty. Shall we stop a bit?â€

I followed him up a narrow path through the wood to what we called the Green Springâ€”a bubbling flow of water over pale serpentine stone, set in a cool, shady bowl of surrounding moss. We knelt, splashed our faces, and drank, sighing with grateful relief. Jamie tipped a handful of water down inside his shirt, closing his eyes in bliss. I laughed at him, but unpinned my sweat-soaked kerchief and doused it in the spring, using it to wipe my neck and arms.

The walk to the spring had caused a break in the conversation, and I wasnâ€™t sure quite howâ€”or whetherâ€”to resume it. Instead, I merely sat quietly in the shade, arms about my knees, idly wriggling my toes in the moss.

Jamie, too, seemed to feel no need of speech for the moment. He leaned comfortably back against a rock, the wet fabric of his shirt plastered to his chest, and we sat still, listening to the wood.

I wasnâ€™t sure what to say, but that didnâ€™t mean I had stopped thinking about the conversation. In an odd way, I thought I understood what Grannie MacNab had meantâ€”though I wasnâ€™t quite sure I agreed with it.

I was thinking more about what Jamie had said, though, regarding a manâ€™s responsibility. Was it true? Perhaps it was, though I had never thought of it in that light before. It was true that he was a bulwarkâ€”not only for me, and for the family, but for the tenants, as well. Was that really how he did it, though? â€œDraw up lines, and fight other folk who come over themâ€? I rather thought it was.

There were lines between him and me, surely; I could have drawn them on the moss. Which was not to say we did not â€œcome acrossâ€ each otherâ€™s linesâ€”we did, frequently, and with varying results. I had my own defensesâ€”and means of enforcement. But he had only beaten me once for crossing his lines, and that was early on. So, had he seen that as a necessary fight? I supposed he had; that was what he was telling me.

But he had been following his own train of thought, which was running on a different track.

â€œItâ€™s verra odd,â€ he said thoughtfully. â€œLaoghaire drove me mad wiâ€™ great regularity, but it never once occurred to me to thrash her.â€

â€œWell, how very thoughtless of you,â€ I said, drawing myself up. I disliked hearing him refer to Laoghaire, no matter what the context.

â€œOh, it was,â€ he replied seriously, taking no notice of my sarcasm. â€œI think it was that I didna care enough for her to think of it, let alone do it.â€

â€œYou didnâ€™t care enough to beat her? Wasnâ€™t she the lucky one, then?â€

He caught the tone of pique in my voice; his eyes sharpened and fixed on my face.

â€œNot to hurt her,â€ he said. Some new thought came to him; I saw it cross his face.

He smiled a little, got up, and came toward me. He reached down and pulled me to my feet, then took hold of my wrist, which he lifted gently over my head and pinned against the trunk of the pine I had been sitting under, so that I was obliged to lean back flat against it.

â€œNot to hurt her,â€ he said again, speaking softly. â€œTo own her. I didna want to possess her. You, mo nighean donnâ€”you, I would own.â€

â€œOwn me?â€ I said. â€œAnd what, exactly, do you mean by that?â€

â€œWhat I say.â€ There was still a gleam of humor in his eyes, but his voice was serious. â€œYeâ€™re mine, Sassenach. And I would do anything I thought I must to make that clear.â€

â€œOh, indeed. Including beating me on a regular basis?â€

â€œNo, I wouldna do that.â€ The corner of his mouth lifted slightly, and the pressure of his grip on my trapped wrist increased. His eyes were deep blue, an inch from mine. â€œI dinna need toâ€”because I could, Sassenachâ€”and ye ken that well.â€

I pulled against his grip, by sheer reflex. I remembered vividly that night in Doonesbury: the feeling of fighting him with all my strengthâ€”to no avail whatever. The horrifying feeling of being pinned to the bed, defenseless and exposed, realizing that he could do anything whatever that he liked to meâ€”and would.

I squirmed violently, trying to escape the grip of memory, as much as his grasp on my flesh. I didnâ€™t succeed, but did turn my wrist so as to be able to sink my nails into his hand.

He didnâ€™t flinch or look away. His other hand touched me lightlyâ€”no more than a brush of my earlobe, but that was quite enough. He could touch me anywhereâ€”in any way.

Evidently, women are capable of experiencing rational thought and sexual arousal simultaneously, because I appeared to be doing precisely that.

My brain was engaged in indignant rebuttal of all kinds of things, including at least half of everything heâ€™d said in the course of the last few minutes.

At the same time, the other end of my spinal cord was not merely shamefully aroused at the thought of physical possession; it was bloody deliriously weak-kneed with desire at the notion, and was causing my hips to sway outward, brushing his.

He was still ignoring the dig of my nails. His other hand came up and took my free hand before I could do anything violent with it; he folded his fingers around mine and held them captive, down at my side.

â€œIf ye asked me, Sassenach, to free yeâ€”â€ he whispered, â€œdâ€™ye think Iâ€™d do so?â€

I took a deep breath; deep enough that my breasts brushed his chest, he stood so close, and realization welled up in me. I stood still, breathing, watching his eyes, and felt my agitation fade slowly away, mutating into a sense of conviction, heavy and warm in the pit of my belly.

I had thought my body swayed in answer to hisâ€”and it did. But his moved unconsciously with mine; the rhythm of the pulse I saw in his throat was the pounding of the heartbeat that echoed in my wrist, and the sway of his body followed mine, barely touching, moving scarcely more than the leaves above, sighing on the breeze.

â€œI wouldnâ€™t ask,â€ I whispered. â€œIâ€™d tell you. And youâ€™d do it. Youâ€™d do as I said.â€

â€œWould I?â€ His grip on my wrist was still firm, and his face so close to mine that I felt his smile, rather than saw it.

â€œYes,â€ I said. I had stopped pulling at my trapped wrist; instead, I pulled my other hand from hisâ€”he made no move to stop meâ€”and brushed a thumb from the lobe of his ear down the side of his neck. He took a short, sharp breath, and a tiny shudder ran through him, stippling his skin with goosebumps in the wake of my touch.

â€œYes, you would,â€ I said again very softly. â€œBecause I own you, too . . . man. Donâ€™t I?â€

His hand released its grip abruptly and slid upward, long fingers intertwining with mine, his palm large and warm and hard against my own.

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said, just as softly. â€œYe do.â€ He lowered his head the last half-inch and his lips brushed mine, whispering, so that I felt the words as much as heard them.

â€œAnd I ken that verra well indeed, mo nighean donn.â€

WOODEARS




DESPITE HIS DISMISSAL of her worries, Jamie had promised his wife to look into the matter, and found opportunity to speak with Malva Christie a few days later.

Coming back from Kenny Lindsayâ€™s place, he met a snake curled up in the dust of the path before him. It was a largish creature, but gaily stripedâ€”not one of the venomous vipers. Still, he couldnâ€™t help it; snakes gave him the grue, and he did not wish to pick it up with his hands, nor yet to step over it. It might not be disposed to lunge up his kiltâ€”but then again, it might. For its part, the snake remained stubbornly curled among the leaves, not budging in response to his â€œShoo!â€ or the stamping of his foot.

He took a step to the side, found an alder, and cut a good stick from it, with which he firmly escorted the wee beastie off the path and into the wood. Affronted, the snake writhed off at a good rate of speed into a hobble-bush, and next thing, a loud shriek came from the other side of the bush.

He darted round it to find Malva Christie, making an urgent, though unsuccessful, effort to squash the agitated snake with a large basket.

â€œItâ€™s all right, lass, let him go.â€ He seized her arm, causing a number of mushrooms to cascade out of her basket, and the snake decamped indignantly in search of quieter surroundings.

He crouched and scooped up the mushrooms for her, while she gasped and fanned herself with the end of her apron.

â€œOh, thank ye, sir,â€ she said, bosom heaving. â€œIâ€™m that terrified oâ€™ snakes.â€

â€œOch, well, thatâ€™s no but a wee king snake,â€ he said, affecting nonchalance. â€œGreat rattersâ€”or so Iâ€™m told.â€

â€œMaybe so, but theyâ€™ve a wicked bite.â€ She shuddered briefly.

â€œYeâ€™ve no been bitten, have ye?â€ He stood up and dumped a final handful of fungus into her basket, and she curtsied in thanks.

â€œNo, sir.â€ She straightened her cap â€œBut Mr. Crombie was. Gully Dornan brought one of those things in a box, to Sunday meeting last, just for mischief, for he kent the text was For they shall take up poisonous serpents and suffer no harm. I think he meant to let it out in the midst of the prayinâ€™.â€ She grinned at the telling, clearly reliving the event.

â€œBut Mr. Crombie saw him with the box, and took it from him, not knowing what was in it. Well, soâ€”Gully was shaking of the box, to keep the snake awake, and when Mr. Crombie opened it, the snake came out like a jack-iâ€™-the-box and bit Mr. Crombie on the lip.â€

Jamie couldnâ€™t help smiling in turn.

â€œDid it, then? I dinna recall hearing about that.â€

â€œWell, Mr. Crombie was that furious,â€ she said, trying for tact. â€œI imagine no one wanted to spread the story, sir, for fear heâ€™d maybe pop with rage.â€

â€œAye, I see,â€ he said dryly. â€œAnd thatâ€™s why he wouldna come to have my wife see to the wound, I suppose.â€

â€œOh, he wouldna do that, sir,â€ she assured him, shaking her head. â€œNot if he was to have cut off his nose by mistake.â€

â€œNo?â€

She picked up the basket, glancing shyly up at him.

â€œWell . . . no. Some say may be as your wifeâ€™s a witch, did ye ken that?â€

He felt an unpleasant tightness in his wame, though he was not surprised to hear it.

â€œShe is a Sassenach,â€ he answered, calm. â€œFolk will always say such things of a stranger, especially a woman.â€ He glanced sideways at her, but her eyes were modestly cast down to the contents of her basket. â€œThink so yourself, do ye?â€

She looked up at that, gray eyes wide.

â€œOh, no, sir! Never!â€

She spoke with such earnestness that he smiled, despite the seriousness of his errand.

â€œWell, I suppose yeâ€™d have noticed, so much time as ye spend in her surgery.â€

â€œOh, I should wish nothing but to be just like her, sir!â€ she assured him, clutching the handle of her basket in worshipful enthusiasm. â€œShe is so kind and lovely, and she kens so much! I want to know all she can teach me, sir.â€

â€œAye, well. Sheâ€™s said often how good it is to have such a pupil as yourself, lass. Yeâ€™re a great help to her.â€ He cleared his throat, wondering how best to work round from these cordialities to a rude inquiry as to whether her father was interfering with her. â€œAh . . . your Da doesna mind that ye spend so much time with my wife?â€

A cloud fell upon her countenance at that, and her long black lashes swept down, hiding the dove-gray eyes.

â€œOh. Well. He . . . he doesna say I mustna go.â€

Jamie made a noncommittal sound in his throat, and gestured her ahead of him back to the path, where he strode along for a bit without further question, allowing her to regain her composure.

â€œWhat dâ€™ye think your father will do,â€ he inquired, swishing his stick casually through a patch of toadflax, â€œonce yeâ€™ve wed and left his house? Is there a woman he might consider? Heâ€™d need someone to do for him, I expect.â€

Her lips tightened at that, to his interest, and a faint flush rose in her cheeks.

â€œI dinna mean to be wed anytime soon, sir. Weâ€™ll manage well enough.â€

Her answer was short enough to cause him to probe a bit.

â€œNo? Surely yeâ€™ve suitors, lassâ€”the lads swoon after ye in droves; Iâ€™ve seen them.â€

The flush on her skin bloomed brighter.

â€œPlease, sir, yeâ€™ll say no such thing to my faither!â€

That rang a small alarm bell in himâ€”but then, she might mean only that Tom Christie was a strict parent, vigilant of his daughterâ€™s virtue. And he would have been astonished to the marrow to learn that Christie was soft, indulgent, or in any way delinquent in such responsibilities.

â€œI shall not,â€ he said mildly. â€œI was only teasinâ€™, lass. Is your father sae fierce, then?â€

She did look at him then, very direct.

â€œThought ye kent him, sir.â€

He burst out laughing at that, and after a momentâ€™s hesitation, she joined him, with a small titter like the sound of the wee birds in the trees above.

â€œI do,â€ he said, recovering. â€œHeâ€™s a good man, Tomâ€”if a bit dour.â€

He looked to see the effect of this. Her face was still flushed, but there was a tiny residual smile on her lips. That was good.

â€œWell, so,â€ he resumed casually, â€œhave ye enough of the woodears there?â€ He nodded at her basket. â€œI saw a good many yesterday, up near the Green Spring.â€

â€œOh, did ye?â€ She glanced up, interested. â€œWhere?â€

â€œIâ€™m headed that way,â€ he said â€œCome if ye like, Iâ€™ll show ye.â€

They made their way along the Ridge, talking of inconsequent things. He led her now and then back to the subject of her father, and noted that she seemed to have no reservations concerning himâ€”only a prudent regard for his foibles and temper.

â€œYour brother, then,â€ he said thoughtfully, at one point. â€œIs he content, dâ€™ye think? Or will he be wanting to leave, maybe go down to the coast? I ken heâ€™s no really a farmer at heart, is he?â€

She snorted a bit, but shook her head.

â€œNo, sir, that heâ€™s not.â€

â€œWhat did he do, then? I mean, he grew up on a plantation, did he not?â€

â€œOh, no, sir.â€ She looked up at him, surprised. â€œHe grew up in Edinburgh. We both did.â€

He was taken back a bit at that. It was true, both she and Allan had an educated accent, but he had thought it only that Christie was a schoolmaster, and strict of such things.

â€œHow is that, lass? Tom said heâ€™d married here, in the Colonies.â€

â€œOh, so he did, sir,â€ she assured him hastily. â€œBut his wife was not a bond servant; she went back to Scotland.â€

â€œI see,â€ he said mildly, seeing her face grow much pinker and her lips press tight. Tom had said his wife had diedâ€”well, and he supposed she had, but in Scotland, after sheâ€™d left him. Proud as Christie was, he could hardly wonder that the man hadnâ€™t confessed to his wifeâ€™s desertion. Butâ€”

â€œIs it true, sir, that your grandsire was Lord Lovat? Him they called the Old Fox?â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said, smiling. â€œI come from a long line of traitors, thieves, and bastards, ken?â€

She laughed at that, and very prettily urged him to tell her more of his sordid family historyâ€”quite obviously, as a means of avoiding his asking more questions regarding hers.

The â€œbutâ€ lingered in his mind, though, even as they talked, with increasing desultoriness as they climbed through the dark, scented forest.

But. Tom Christie had been arrested two or three days after the Battle of Culloden, and imprisoned for the next ten years, before being transported to America. He did not know Malvaâ€™s exact age, but he thought she must be eighteen or soâ€”though she often seemed older, her manner was so poised.

She must have been conceived, then, quite soon after Christieâ€™s arrival in the Colonies. No great wonder, if the man had seized the first chance he had to marry, after living without a woman for so long. And then the wife had thought better of her bargain, and gone. Christie had told Roger Mac his wife had died of influenzaâ€”well, a man had his pride, and God knew Tom Christie had more than most.

But Allan Christie . . . where had he come from? The young man was somewhere in his twenties; it was possible that he had been conceived before Culloden. But if soâ€”who was his mother?

â€œYou and your brother,â€ he said abruptly, at the next break in conversation. â€œDid ye have the same mother?â€

â€œYes, sir,â€ she said, looking startled.

â€œAh,â€ he said, and let the subject drop. Well, now. So Christie had been wed before Culloden. And then the woman, whoever she was, had come to find him in the Colonies. That argued a high degree of determination and devotion, and made him regard Christie with a good deal more interest. But that devotion had not been proof against the hardships of the Coloniesâ€”or else she found Tom so changed by time and circumstance that the devotion had been drowned in disappointment, and she had left again.

He could see that, easilyâ€”and felt an unexpected bond of sympathy with Tom Christie. He recalled his own feelings, all too well, when Claire came back to find him. The disbelieving joy of her presenceâ€”and the bone-deep fear that she would not recognize the man she had known, in the man who stood before her.

Worse, if she had discovered something that made her fleeâ€”and well as he knew Claire, he still was not sure that she would have stayed, if heâ€™d told her at once about his marriage to Laoghaire. For that matter, if Laoghaire hadnâ€™t shot him and nearly killed him, Claire might well have run away, and been lost for good. The thought of it was a black pit, gaping at his feet.

Of course, had she gone, he would have died, he reflected. And never come to this place and got his land, nor seen his daughter, nor held his grandson in his arms. Come to think, perhaps being nearly killed wasnâ€™t always a misfortuneâ€”so long as you didnâ€™t actually die of it.

â€œDoes your arm trouble ye, sir?â€ He was jerked back from his thoughts to realize that he was standing like a fool, one hand clutching the spot on his upper arm where Laoghaireâ€™s pistol ball had gone through and Malva squinting at him in concern.

â€œAh, no,â€ he said hastily, dropping his hand. â€œA midgie bite. The bittie things are out early. Tell meâ€â€”he groped for some neutral topic of conversationâ€”â€œdâ€™ye like it here in the mountains?â€

Inane as the question was, she appeared to consider it seriously.

â€œItâ€™s lonely, sometimes,â€ she said, and glanced into the forest, where falling shafts of sunlight splintered on leaves and needles, shrubs and rocks, filling the air with a shattered green light. â€œBut it is . . .â€ she groped for a word. â€œPretty,â€ she said, with a small smile at him, acknowledging the inadequacy of the word.

They had reached the small clearing where the water bubbled out over a ledge of what his daughter said was serpentineâ€”the rock whose soft green gave the spring its name; that, and the thick layer of vivid moss that grew around it.

He gestured to her to kneel and drink first. She did, cupping her hands to her face and closing her eyes in bliss at the taste of the cold, sweet water. She gulped, cupped her hands and drank again, almost greedily. She was very pretty herself, he thought in amusement, and the word was much more appropriate to the wee lassie, with that delicate chin and the lobes of her tender pink ears peeping from her cap, than to the spirit of the mountains. Her mother must have been lovely, he thoughtâ€”and it was fortunate for the lass that she had not taken much of her fatherâ€™s grim looks, save those gray eyes.

She sat back on her heels, breathing deep, and scooted to the side, nodding at him to kneel and take his turn. The day wasnâ€™t hot, but it was a steep climb to the spring, and the cold water went down gratefully.

â€œIâ€™ve never seen the Highlands,â€ Malva said, dabbing the end of her kerchief over her wet face. â€œSome say this place is like it, though. Dâ€™ye think so yourself, sir?â€

He shook the water from his fingers and wiped the back of his hand across his mouth.

â€œSomething like. Some parts. The Great Glen, and the forestâ€”aye, thatâ€™s verra like this.â€ He pointed his chin up at the trees surrounding them, murmurous and resin-scented. â€œBut thereâ€™s nay bracken here. And nay peat, of course. And nay heather; thatâ€™s the biggest difference.â€

â€œYe hear the storiesâ€”of men hiding in the heather. Did ye ever do so yourself, sir?â€ She dimpled slightly, and he didnâ€™t know whether she meant to tease, or was only making conversation.

â€œNow and then,â€ he said, and smiled at her as he rose, brushing pine needles from his kilt. â€œStalking the deer, aye? Here, Iâ€™ll show ye the woodears.â€

The fungus grew in thick shelves at the foot of an oak, no more than ten feet from the spring. Some of the things had opened their gills already, begun to darken and curl; the ground nearby was scattered with the spores, a dark brown powder that lay upon the glossy crackle of last yearâ€™s dry leaves. The fresher fungi were still bright, though, deep orange and meaty.

He left her there with a cordial word, and went back down the narrow trail, wondering about the woman who had loved and left Tom Christie.

THE VENOM OF THE

NORTH WIND




July 1774

BRIANNA DROVE THE SHARP end of the spade into the muddy bank and pulled out a chunk of clay the color of chocolate fudge. She could have done without the reminder of food, she thought, flinging it aside into the current with a grunt. She hitched up her soggy shift and wiped a forearm across her brow. She hadnâ€™t eaten since mid-morning, and it was nearly teatime. Not that she meant to stop until supper. Roger was up the mountain, helping Amy McCallum rebuild her chimney stack, and the little boys had gone up to the Big House to be fed bread and butter and honey and generally spoiled by Mrs. Bug. Sheâ€™d wait to eat; there was too much to do here.

â€œDâ€™ye need help, lass?â€

She squinted, shading her eyes against the sun. Her father was standing on the bank above, viewing her efforts with what looked like amusement.

â€œDo I look like I need help?â€ she asked irritably, swiping the back of a mud-streaked hand across her jaw.

â€œYe do, aye.â€

Heâ€™d been fishing; barefoot and wet to mid-thigh. He laid his rod against a tree and swung the creel from his shoulder, woven reeds creaking with the weight of the catch. Then he grasped a sapling for balance, and started to edge down the slippery bank, bare toes squelching in the mud.

â€œWaitâ€”take your shirt off!â€ She realized her mistake an instant too late. A startled look flitted across his face, only for a moment, and then was gone.

â€œI mean . . . the mud . . .â€ she said, knowing it was too late. â€œThe washing.â€

â€œOh, aye, to be sure.â€ Without hesitation, he pulled the shirt over his head and turned his back to her, hunting for a convenient branch from which to hang it.

His scars were not really shocking. Sheâ€™d glimpsed them before, imagined them many times, and the reality was much less vivid. The scars were old, a faint silvered net, moving easily over the shadows of his ribs as he reached upward. He moved naturally. Only the tension in his shoulders suggested otherwise.

Her hand closed involuntarily, feeling for an absent pencil, feeling the stroke of the line that would capture that tiny sense of unease, the jarring note that would draw the observer closer, closer still, wondering what it was about this scene of pastoral grace. . . .

Thou shalt not uncover thy fatherâ€™s nakedness, she thought, and spread her hand flat, pressing it hard against her thigh. But he had turned back and was coming down the bank, eyes on the tangled rushes and protruding stones underfoot.

He slid the last two feet and arrived beside her with a splash, arms flailing to keep his balance. She laughed, as heâ€™d intended, and he smiled. Sheâ€™d thought for an instant to speak of it, make some apologyâ€”but he would not meet her eyes.

â€œSo, then, move it, or go round?â€ His attention focused on the boulder embedded in the bank, he leaned his weight against it and shoved experimentally.

â€œCan we move it, do you think?â€ She waded up beside him, retucking the hem of her shift, which she had pulled between her legs and fastened with a belt. â€œGoing round would mean digging another ten feet of ditch.â€

â€œThat much?â€ He glanced at her in surprise.

â€œYes. I want to cut a notch here, to cut through to that bendâ€”then I can put a small water-wheel here and get a good fall.â€ She leaned past him, pointing downstream. â€œThe next-best place would be down thereâ€”see where the banks rise?â€”but this is better.â€

â€œAye, all right. Wait a bit, then.â€ He made his way back to the bank, scrambled up, and disappeared into the wood, from whence he returned with several stout lengths of fresh oak sapling, still sporting the remnants of their glossy leaves.

â€œWe dinna need to get it out of the creekbed, aye?â€ he asked. â€œOnly move it a few feet, so ye can cut through the bank beyond it?â€

â€œThatâ€™s it.â€ Rivulets of sweat, trapped by her thick eyebrows, ran tickling down the sides of her face. Sheâ€™d been digging for the best part of an hour; her arms ached from heaving shovelsful of heavy mud, and her hands were blistered. With a sense of profound gratitude, she surrendered the spade and stepped back in the creek, stooping to splash cold water on her scratched arms and flushed face.

â€œHeavy work,â€ her father observed, grunting a little as he briskly finished undermining the boulder. â€œCould ye not have asked Roger Mac to do it?â€

â€œHeâ€™s busy,â€ she said, perceiving the shortness of her tone, but not inclined to disguise it.

Her father darted a sharp glance at her, but said no more, merely busying himself with the proper placement of his oak staves. Attracted like iron filings to the magnetism of their grandfatherâ€™s presence, Jemmy and Germain appeared like magic, loudly wanting to help.

Sheâ€™d asked them to help, and theyâ€™d helpedâ€”for a few minutes, before being drawn away by the glimpse of a porcupine high up in the trees. With Jamie in charge, of course, they leaped to the task, madly scooping dirt from the bank with flat bits of wood, giggling, pushing, getting in the way, and stuffing handsful of mud down the back of each otherâ€™s breeches.

Jamie being Jamie, he ignored the nuisance, merely directing their efforts and finally ordering them out of the creek, so as not to be crushed.

â€œAll right, lass,â€ he said, turning to her. â€œTake a grip there.â€ The boulder had been loosened from the confining clay, and now protruded from the bank, oak staves thrust into the mud beneath, sticking up on either side, and another behind.

She seized the one he indicated, while he took the other two.

â€œOn the count of three . . . one . . . two . . . heave!â€

Jem and Germain, perched above, chimed in, chanting â€œOne . . . two . . . heave!â€ like a small Greek chorus. There was a splinter in her thumb and the wood rasped against the waterlogged creases of her skin, but she felt suddenly like laughing.

â€œOne . . . two . . . heaâ€”â€ With a sudden shift, a swirl of mud, and a cascade of loose dirt from the bank above, the boulder gave way, falling into the stream with a splash that soaked them both to the chest and made both little boys shriek with joy.

Jamie was grinning ear-to-ear and so was she, wet shift and muddy children notwithstanding. The boulder now lay near the opposite bank of the stream, andâ€”just as she had calculatedâ€”the diverted current was already eating into the newly created hollow in the near bank, a strong eddy eating away the fine-grained clay in streams and spirals.

â€œSee that?â€ She nodded at it, dabbing her mud-spattered face on the shoulder of her shift. â€œI donâ€™t know how far it will erode, but if I let it go for a day or two, there wonâ€™t be much digging left to do.â€

â€œYe kent that would happen?â€ Her father glanced at her, face alight, and laughed. â€œWhy, ye clever, bonnie wee thing!â€

The glow of recognized achievement did quite a bit to dampen her resentment of Rogerâ€™s absence. The presence of a bottle of cider in Jamieâ€™s creel, keeping cold amongst the dead trout, did a lot more. They sat companionably on the bank, passing the bottle back and forth, admiring the industry of the new eddy pool at work.

â€œThis looks like good clay,â€ she observed, leaning forward to scoop a little of the wet stuff out of the crumbling bank. She squeezed it in her hand, letting grayish water run down her arm, and opened her hand to show him how it kept its shape, showing clearly the prints of her fingers.

â€œGood for your kiln?â€ he asked, peering dutifully at it.

â€œWorth a try.â€ She had made several less-than-successful experiments with the kiln so far, producing a succession of malformed plates and bowls, most of which had either exploded in the kiln or shattered immediately upon removal. One or two survivals, deformed and scorched round the edges, had been pressed into dubious service, but it was precious little reward for the effort of stoking the kiln and minding it for days.

What she needed was advice from someone who knew about kilns and making earthenware. But with the strained relations now existent between the Ridge and Salem, she couldnâ€™t seek it. It had been awkward enough, her speaking directly to Brother Mordecai about his ceramic processesâ€”a Popish woman, and speaking to a man she wasnâ€™t married to, the scandal!

â€œDamn wee Manfred,â€ her father agreed, hearing her complaint. Heâ€™d heard it before, but didnâ€™t mention it. He hesitated. â€œWould it maybe help was I to go and ask? A few oâ€™ the Brethren will still speak to me, and it might be that theyâ€™d let me talk wiâ€™ Mordecai. If ye were to tell me what it is ye need to know . . . ? Ye could maybe write it down.â€

â€œOh, Da, I love you!â€ Grateful, she leaned to kiss him, and he laughed, clearly gratified to be doing her a service.

Elated, she took another drink of cider, and rosy visions of hardened clay pipes began to dance in her brain. She had a wooden cistern already built, with a lot of complaint and obstruction from Ronnie Sinclair. She needed help to heave that into place. Then, if she could get only twenty feet of reliable pipe . . .

â€œMama, come look!â€ Jemâ€™s impatient voice cut through the fog of calculation. With a mental sigh, she made a hasty note of where she had been, and pushed the process carefully into a corner of her mind, where it would perhaps helpfully ferment.

She handed the bottle back to her father, and made her way down the bank to where the boys squatted, expecting to be shown frog spawn, a drowned skunk, or some other wonder of nature appealing to small boys.

â€œWhat is it?â€ she called.

â€œLook, look!â€ Jemmy spotted her and popped upright, pointing to the rock at his feet.

They were standing on the Flat Rock, a prominent feature of the creek. As the name suggested, it was a flat shelf of granite, large enough for three men to occupy at once, undercut by the water so that it jutted out over the boiling stream. It was a favorite spot for fishing.

Someone had built a small fire; there was a blackened smudge on the rock, with what looked like the remnants of charred sticks in the center. It was much too small for a cooking fire, but still, she would have thought nothing of it. Her father was frowning at the fire site, though, in a way that made her walk out onto the rock and stand beside him, looking.

The objects in the ashes werenâ€™t sticks.

â€œBones,â€ she said at once, and squatted down to look closer. â€œWhat kind of animal are those from?â€ Even as she said it, her mind was analyzing and rejectingâ€”squirrel, possum, rabbit, deer, pigâ€”unable to make sense of the shapes.

â€œTheyâ€™re finger bones, lass,â€ he said, lowering his voice as he glanced at Jemmyâ€”who had lost interest in the fire and was now sliding down the muddy bank, to the further detriment of his breeches. â€œDinna touch them,â€ he addedâ€”unnecessarily, as she had drawn back her hand in instant revulsion.

â€œFrom a human, you mean?â€ Instinctively, she wiped her hand on the side of her thigh, though she had touched nothing.

He nodded, and squatted beside her, studying the charred remains. There were blackened lumps there, tooâ€”though she thought these were the remains of some plant material; one was greenish, maybe a stem of something, incompletely burned.

Jamie bent low, sniffing at the burned remains. Instinctively, Brianna drew a deep breath through her nose in imitationâ€”then snorted, trying to get rid of the smell. It was disconcerting: a reek of char, overlaid with something bitter and chalkyâ€”and that in turn overlaid with a sort of pungent scent that reminded her of medicine.

â€œWhere could they have come from?â€ she asked, also low-voicedâ€”though Jemmy and Germain had begun pelting each other with mudballs, and wouldnâ€™t have noticed if sheâ€™d shouted.

â€œI havena noticed anyone missing a hand, have you?â€ Jamie glanced up, giving her a half-smile. She didnâ€™t return it.

â€œNot walking around, no. But if they arenâ€™t walking aroundâ€”â€ She swallowed, trying to ignore the half-imagined taste of bitter herbs and burning. â€œWhereâ€™s the rest? Of the body, I mean.â€

That word, â€œbody,â€ seemed to bring the whole thing into a new and nasty focus.

â€œWhereâ€™s the rest of that finger, I wonder?â€ Jamie was frowning at the blackened smudge. He moved a knuckle toward it, and she saw what he had seen: a paler smudge within the circle of the fire, where part of the ashes had been swept away. There were three fingers, she saw, still swallowing repeatedly. Two were intact, the bones gray-white and spectral among the ashes. Two joints of the third were gone, though; only the slender last phalanx remained.

â€œAn animal?â€ She glanced round for traces, but there were no pawprints on the surface of the rockâ€”only the muddy smudges left by the little boysâ€™ bare feet.

Vague visions of cannibalism were beginning to stir queasily in the pit of her stomach, though she rejected the notion at once.

â€œYou donâ€™t think Ianâ€”â€ She stopped abruptly.

â€œIan?â€ Her father looked up, astonished. â€œWhy should Ian do such a thing?â€

â€œI donâ€™t think he would,â€ she said, taking hold of common sense. â€œNot at all. It was just a thoughtâ€”Iâ€™d heard that the Iroquois sometimes . . . sometimes . . .â€ She nodded at the charred bones, unwilling to articulate the thought further. â€œUm . . . maybe a friend of Ianâ€™s? Uh . . . visiting?â€

Jamieâ€™s face darkened a little, but he shook his head.

â€œNay, thereâ€™s the smell of the Highlands about this. The Iroquois will burn an enemy. Or cut bits off him, to be sure. But not like that.â€ He pointed at the bones with his chin, in the Highland way. â€œThis is a private business, ken? A witchâ€”or one of their shamans, maybeâ€”might do a thing like that; not a warrior.â€

â€œI havenâ€™t seen any Indians of any kind lately. Not on the Ridge. Have you?â€

He looked at the burned smudge a moment longer, frowning, then shook his head.

â€œNo, nor anyone missing a few fingers, either.â€

â€œYouâ€™re sure theyâ€™re human?â€ She studied the bones, trying for other possibilities. â€œMaybe from a small bear? Or a big coon?â€

â€œMaybe,â€ he said flatly, but she could tell he said it only for her sake. He was sure.

â€œMama!â€ The patter of bare feet on the rock behind her was succeeded by a tug at her sleeve. â€œMama, weâ€™re hungry!â€

â€œOf course you are,â€ she said, rising to meet the demand, but still gazing abstractedly at the charred remnants. â€œYou havenâ€™t eaten in nearly an hour. What did youâ€”â€ Her gaze drifted slowly from the fire to her son, then snapped abruptly, focusing on the two little boys, who stood grinning at her, covered from head to foot in mud.

â€œLook at you!â€ she said, dismay tempered by resignation. â€œHow could you possibly get that filthy?â€

â€œOh, itâ€™s easy, lass,â€ her father assured her, grinning as he rose to his feet. â€œEasy cured, too, though.â€ He bent, and seizing Germain by the back of shirt and seat of breeks, heaved him neatly off the rock and into the pool below.

â€œMe, too, me, too! Me, too, Grandda!â€ Jemmy was dancing up and down in excitement, spattering clods of mud in all direction.

â€œOh, aye. You, too.â€ Jamie bent and grabbed Jem round the waist, launching him high into the air in a flutter of shirt before Brianna could cry out.

â€œHe canâ€™t swim!â€

This protest coincided with a huge splash, as Jem hit the water and promptly sank like a rock. She was striding toward the edge, prepared to dive in after him, when her father put a hand on her arm to stop her.

â€œWait a bit,â€ he said. â€œHow will ye ken whether he swims or not, if ye dinna let him try?â€

Germain was already arrowing his way toward shore, his sleek blond head dark with water. Jemmy popped up behind him, though, splashing and spluttering, and Germain dived, turned like an otter, and came up alongside.

â€œKick!â€ he called to Jemmy, churning up a huge spray in illustration. â€œGo on your back!â€

Jemmy ceased flailing, went on his back, and kicked madly. His hair was plastered over his face and the spray of his efforts must have obscured any remnants of visionâ€”but he went on valiantly kicking, to encouraging whoops from Jamie and Germain.

The pool was no more than ten feet across, and he reached the shallows on the opposite bank within seconds, beaching among the rocks by virtue of crashing headfirst into one. He stopped, thrashing feebly in the shallows, then bounced to his feet, showering water, and shoved the wet hair out of his face. He looked amazed.

â€œI can swim!â€ he shouted. â€œMama, I can swim!â€

â€œThatâ€™s wonderful!â€ she called, torn between sharing his ecstatic pride, the urge to rush home and tell Roger about itâ€”and dire visions of Jemmy now leaping heedlessly into bottomless ponds and rock-jagged rapids, under the reckless delusion that he could indeed swim. But heâ€™d gotten his feet wet, in no uncertain terms; there was no going back.

â€œCome here!â€ She bent toward him, clapping her hands. â€œCan you swim back to me? Come on, come here!â€

He looked blankly at her for an instant, then around him at the rippling water of the pool. The blaze of excitement in his face died.

â€œI forget,â€ he said, and his mouth curled down, fat with sudden woe. â€œI forget how!â€

â€œFall down and kick!â€ Germain bellowed helpfully, from his perch on the rock. â€œYou can do it, cousin!â€

Jemmy took one or two blundering steps into the water, but stopped, lip trembling, terror and confusion starting to overwhelm him.

â€œStay there, a chuisle! Iâ€™m coming!â€ Jamie called, and dove cleanly into the pool, a long pale streak beneath the water, bubbles streaming from hair and breeks. He popped up in front of Jemmy in an explosion of breath and shook his head, flinging strands of wet red hair out of his face.

â€œCome along then, man,â€ he said, scooting round on his knees in the shallows, so that his back was to Jemmy. He looked back, patting his own shoulder. â€œTake hold of me here, aye? Weâ€™ll swim back together.â€

And they did, kicking and splashing in ungainly dog paddle, Jemmyâ€™s shrieks of excitement echoed by Germain, who had leaped into the water to paddle alongside.

Hauled out onto the rock, the three of them lay puddled, gasping and laughing at her feet, water spreading in pools around them.

â€œWell, you are cleaner,â€ she said judiciously, moving her foot away from a spreading streamlet. â€œIâ€™ll admit that much.â€

â€œOf course we are.â€ Jamie sat up, wringing out the long tail of his hair. â€œIt occurs to me, lass, that thereâ€™s maybe a better way to do what ye want.â€

â€œWhat I wâ€”oh. You mean the water?â€

â€œAye, that.â€ He sniffed, and rubbed the back of his hand under his nose. â€œIâ€™ll show ye, if ye come up to the house after supper.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s that, Grandda?â€ Jemmy had got to his feet, wet hair standing up in red spikes, and was looking curiously at Jamieâ€™s back. He put out a tentative finger and traced one of the long, curving scars.

â€œWhat? Oh . . . that.â€ Jamieâ€™s face went quite blank for a moment. â€œItâ€™s . . . ah . . .â€

â€œSome bad people hurt Grandda once,â€ she interrupted firmly, bending down to pick Jemmy up. â€œBut that was a long time ago. Heâ€™s all right now. You weigh a ton!â€

â€œPapa says GrandpÃ¨re is perhaps a silkie,â€ Germain remarked, viewing Jamieâ€™s back with interest. â€œLike his papa before him. Did the bad people find you in your silkie skin, GrandpÃ¨re, and try to cut it from you? He would then of course become a man again,â€ he explained matter-of-factly, looking up at Jemmy, â€œand could kill them with his sword.â€

Jamie was staring at Germain. He blinked, and wiped his nose again.

â€œOh,â€ he said. â€œAye. Um. Aye, I expect that was the way of it. If your papa says so.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s a silkie?â€ asked Jemmy, bewildered but interested. He wiggled in Briannaâ€™s arms, wanting to be put down, and she lowered him back to the rock.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ Germain admitted. â€œBut they have fur. Whatâ€™s a silkie, GrandpÃ¨re?â€

Jamie closed his eyes against the sinking sun, and rubbed a hand over his face, shaking his head a little. Brianna thought he was smiling, but couldnâ€™t tell for sure.

â€œAh, well,â€ he said, sitting up straighter, opening his eyes, and throwing back his wet hair. â€œA silkie is a creature who is a man upon the land, but becomes a seal within the sea. And a seal,â€ he added, cutting off Jemmy, who had been opening his mouth to ask, â€œis a great sleek beastie that barks like a dog, is as big as an ox, and beautiful as the black of night. They live in the sea, but come out onto the rocks near the shore sometimes.â€

â€œHave you seen them, GrandpÃ¨re?â€ Germain asked, eager.

â€œOh, many a time,â€ Jamie assured him. â€œThere are a great many seals who live on the coasts of Scotland.â€

â€œScotland,â€ Jemmy echoed. His eyes were round.

â€œMa mÃ¨re says Scotland is a good place,â€ Germain remarked. â€œShe cries sometimes, when she talks of it. I am not so sure I would like it, though.â€

â€œWhy not?â€ Brianna asked.

â€œItâ€™s full of giants and water horses and . . . things,â€ Germain replied, frowning. â€œI donâ€™t want to meet any of those. And parritch, Maman says, but we have parritch here.â€

â€œSo we have. And I expect itâ€™s time we were going home to eat some.â€ Jamie got to his feet and stretched, groaning in the pleasure of it. The late-afternoon sun washed rock and water with a golden light, gleaming on the boysâ€™ cheeks and the bright hairs on her fatherâ€™s arms.

Jemmy stretched and groaned, too, in worshipful imitation, and Jamie laughed.

â€œCome on, wee fishie. Dâ€™ye want a ride home?â€ He bent so that Jemmy could scramble onto his back, then straightened up, settling the little boyâ€™s weight, and put out a hand to take Germainâ€™s.

Jamie saw her attention turn momentarily back toward the blackened smudge at the edge of the rock.

â€œLeave it, lass,â€ he said quietly. â€œItâ€™s a charm of some kind. Ye dinna want to touch it.â€

Then he stepped off the rock and made for the trail, Jemmy on his back and Germain clutched firmly by the back of the neck, both boys giggling as they made their way through the slippery mud of the path.

Brianna retrieved her spade and Jamieâ€™s shirt from the creekbank, and caught the boys up on the trail to the Big House. A breeze had begun to breathe through the trees, chilly in the damp cloth of her shift, but the heat of walking was enough to keep her from being cold.

Germain was singing softly to himself, still hand-in-hand with his grandfather, his small blond head tilting back and forth like a metronome.

Jemmy sighed in exhausted bliss, legs wrapped round Jamieâ€™s middle, arms about his neck, and leaned his sun-reddened cheek against the scarred back. Then he thought of something, for he raised his head and kissed his grandfather with a loud smacking noise, between the shoulder blades.

Her father jerked, nearly dropping Jem, and made a high-pitched noise that made her laugh.

â€œIs that make it better?â€ Jem inquired seriously, pulling himself up and trying to look over Jamieâ€™s shoulder into his face.

â€œOh. Aye, lad,â€ his grandfather assured him, face twitching. â€œMuch better.â€

The gnats and midges were out in force now. She beat a cloud of them away from her face, and slapped a mosquito that lit on Germainâ€™s neck.

â€œAk!â€ he said, hunching his shoulders, but then resumed singing â€œAlouette,â€ undisturbed.

Jemmyâ€™s shirt was thin, worn linen, cut down from one of Rogerâ€™s old ones. The cloth had dried to the shape of his body, square-rumped and solid, the breadth of his small, tender shoulders echoing the wide set of the older, firmer ones he clung to. She glanced from the redheads to Germain, walking reed-thin and graceful through shadows and light, still singing, and thought how desperately beautiful men were.

â€œWho were the bad people, Grandda?â€ Jemmy asked drowsily, head nodding with the rhythm of Jamieâ€™s steps.

â€œSassunaich,â€ Jamie replied briefly. â€œEnglish soldiers.â€

â€œEnglish canaille,â€ Germain amplified, breaking off his song. â€œThey are the ones who cut off my papaâ€™s hand, too.â€

â€œThey were?â€ Jemmyâ€™s head lifted in momentary attention, then fell back between Jamieâ€™s shoulder blades with a thump that made his grandfather grunt. â€œDid you kill them with your sword, Grandda?â€

â€œSome of them.â€

â€œI will kill the rest, when I am big,â€ Germain declared. â€œIf there are any left.â€

â€œI suppose there might be.â€ Jamie hitched Jemâ€™s weight a little higher, letting go Germainâ€™s hand in order to hold Jemmyâ€™s slackening legs tight to his body.

â€œMe, too,â€ Jemmy murmured, eyelids drooping. â€œIâ€™ll kill them, too.â€

At the fork in the trail, Jamie surrendered her son to her, sound asleep, and took back his shirt. He pulled it on, brushing disheveled hair out of his face as his head came through. He smiled at her, then leaned forward and kissed her forehead, gently, putting one hand on Jemmyâ€™s round, red head where it lay against her shoulder.

â€œDinna fash yourself, lass,â€ he said softly. â€œIâ€™ll speak to Mordecai. And your man. Take care of this one.â€



â€œTHIS IS A PRIVATE BUSINESS,â€ her father had said. The general implication being that she should leave it alone. And she might have, save for a couple of things. One, that Roger had come home well after dark, whistling a song he said Amy McCallum had taught him. And two, that other offhand remark her father had made about the fire on the Flat Rockâ€”that there was a smell of the Highlands about it.

Brianna had a very keen nose, and she smelled a rat. She also had recognizedâ€”belatedlyâ€”what had made Jamie say what he had. The odd smell of the fire, that tang of medicineâ€”it was iodine; the smell of burned seaweed. Sheâ€™d smelled a fire built of sea wrack on the shore near Ullapool, in her own time, when Roger had taken her up there for a picnic.

There was certainly seaweed on the coast, and it wasnâ€™t impossible that someone, sometime, had brought some inland. But it also wasnâ€™t impossible that some of the fisher-folk had brought bits of it from Scotland, in the way that some exiles might bring earth in jar, or a handful of pebbles to remind them of the land left behind.

A charm, her father had said. And the song Roger had learned from Amy McCallum was called â€œThe Deasil Charm,â€ he said.

All of which was no particular evidence of anything. Still, she mentioned the small fire and its contents to Mrs. Bug, just from curiosity. Mrs. Bug knew a good deal about Highland charms of all sorts.

Mrs. Bug frowned thoughtfully at her description, lips pursed.

â€œBones, ye say? What sortâ€”the bones of an animal, were they, or a man?â€

Brianna felt as though someone had dropped a slug down her back.

â€œA man?â€

â€œOh, aye. Thereâ€™s some charms that take grave dust, ken, and some the dust of bones, or the ashes of a body.â€ Evidently reminded by the mention of ashes, Mrs. Bug pulled a big pottery mixing bowl from the warm ashes of the hearth, and peered into it. The bread starter had died a few days before, and the bowl of flour, water, and honey had been set out in hopes of snaring a wild yeast from the passing air.

The round little Scotswoman frowned at the bowl, shook her head, and put it back with a brief muttered verse in Gaelic. Naturally, Brianna thought, slightly amused, there would be a prayer for catching yeast. Which patron saint was in charge of that?

â€œWhat ye said, though,â€ Mrs. Bug said, returning both to her chopping of turnips and to the original subject of conversation. â€œAbout it beinâ€™ on the Flat Rock. Seaweed, bones, and a flat rock. Thatâ€™s a love charm, lass. The one they call the Venom oâ€™ the North Wind.â€

â€œWhat a really peculiar name for a love charm,â€ she said, staring at Mrs. Bug, who laughed.

â€œOch, now, do I remember it at all?â€ she asked rhetorically. She wiped her hands upon her apron, and folding them at her waist with a vaguely theatrical air, recited:

â€œA love charm for thee,

Water drawn through a straw,

The warmth of him thou lovest,

With love to draw on thee.

â€œArise betimes on Lordâ€™s day,

To the flat rock of the shore

Take with thee the butterbur

And the foxglove.

â€œA small quantity of embers

In the skirt of thy kirtle,

A special handful of seaweed

In a wooden shovel.

â€œThree bones of an old man,

Newly torn from the grave,

Nine stalks of royal fern,

Newly trimmed with an ax.

â€œBurn them on a fire of faggots

And make them all into ashes;

Sprinkle in the fleshy breast of thy lover,

Against the venom of the north wind.

â€œGo round the rath of procreation,

The circuit of the five turns,

And I will vow and warrant thee

That man shall never leave thee.â€

Mrs. Bug unfolded her hands and took another turnip, quartering it with neat, quick chops and tossing the pieces into the pot. â€œYeâ€™re not wanting such a thing yourself, I hope?â€

â€œNo,â€ Brianna murmured, feeling the small cold feeling continue down her back. â€œDo you thinkâ€”would the fisher-folk use a charm like that?â€

â€œWell, as to that, I canna say what theyâ€™d doâ€”but surely a few would ken that charm; itâ€™s weel enough known, though I havena kent anyone myself has done it. There are easier ways to make a lad fall in love wiâ€™ ye, lass,â€ she added, pointing a stubby finger at Brianna in admonition. â€œCook him up a nice plate oâ€™ neeps boiled in milk and served wiâ€™ butter, for one.â€

â€œIâ€™ll remember,â€ Brianna promised, smiling, and excused herself.

She had meant to go home; there were dozens of things needing to be done, from spinning yarn and weaving cloth, to plucking and drawing the half dozen dead geese she had shot and hung in the lean-to. But instead she found her footsteps turning up the hill, along the overgrown trail that led to the graveyard.

Surely it wasnâ€™t Amy McCallum whoâ€™d made that charm, she thought. It would have taken her hours to walk down the mountain from her cabin, and her with a small baby to tend. But babies could be carried. And no one would know whether she had left her cabin, save perhaps Aidanâ€”and Aidan didnâ€™t talk to anyone but Roger, whom he worshipped.

The sun was nearly down, and the tiny cemetery had a melancholy look to it, long shadows from its sheltering trees slanting cold and dark across the needle-strewn ground and the small collection of crude markers, cairns, and wooden crosses. The pines and hemlocks murmured uneasily overhead in the rising breeze of evening.

The sense of cold had spread from her backbone, making a wide patch between her shoulder blades. Seeing the earth grubbed up beneath the wooden marker with Ephraim on it didnâ€™t help.

SHARP EDGES




HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN better. Did know better. But what could he have done? Much more important, what was he to do now?

Roger made his way slowly up the mountainside, nearly oblivious to its beauty. Nearly, but not quite. Desolate in the bleakness of winter, the secluded notch where Amy McCallumâ€™s ramshackle cabin perched among the laurels was a blaze of color and life in spring and summerâ€”so vivid that even his worry couldnâ€™t stop his noticing the blaze of pinks and reds, interrupted by soft patches of creamy dogwood and carpets of bluets, their tiny blue flowers nodding on slender stems above the torrent of the stream that bounded down beside the rocky trail.

They must have chosen the site in summer, he reflected cynically. It would have seemed charming then. He hadnâ€™t known Orem McCallum, but plainly the man hadnâ€™t been any more practical than his wife, or they would have realized the dangers of their remoteness.

The present situation wasnâ€™t Amyâ€™s fault, though; he shouldnâ€™t blame her for his own lack of judgment.

He didnâ€™t precisely blame himself, eitherâ€”but he should have noticed sooner what was going on; what was being said.

â€œEverybody kens ye spend more time up at the notch wiâ€™ the widow McCallum than ye do with your own wife.â€

Thatâ€™s what Malva Christie had said, her little pointed chin raised in defiance. â€œTell my father, and Iâ€™ll tell everyone Iâ€™ve seen you kiss Amy McCallum. Theyâ€™ll all believe me.â€

He felt an echo of the astonishment heâ€™d felt at her wordsâ€”an astonishment succeeded by anger. At the girl and her silly threat, but much more at himself.

Heâ€™d been working at the whisky clearing and, heading back to the cabin for dinner, had rounded a turn in the trail and surprised the two of them, Malva and Bobby Higgins, locked in an embrace. Theyâ€™d sprung apart like a pair of startled deer, eyes wide, so alarmed as to be funny.

Heâ€™d smiled, but before he could either apologize or fade tactfully into the underbrush, Malva had stepped up to him, eyes still wide, but blazing with determination.

â€œTell my father,â€ sheâ€™d said, â€œand Iâ€™ll tell everyone Iâ€™ve seen you kiss Amy McCallum.â€

Heâ€™d been so taken aback by her words that heâ€™d scarcely noticed Bobby, until the young soldier had put a hand on her arm, murmuring something to her, drawing her away. Sheâ€™d turned reluctantly, with a last, wary, meaningful glance at Roger, and a parting shot that left him staggered.

â€œEverybody kens ye spend more time up at the notch wiâ€™ the widow McCallum than ye do with your own wife. Theyâ€™ll all believe me.â€

God damn it, they would, too, and it was his own bloody fault. Bar one or two sarcastic remarks, Bree hadnâ€™t protested his visits; sheâ€™d acceptedâ€”or seemed toâ€”that someone had to go now and then to see the McCallums, make sure they had food and fire, provide a few momentsâ€™ company, a small respite in the monotony of loneliness and labor.

Heâ€™d done such things often, going with the Reverend to call on the aged, the widowed, the ill of the congregation; take them food, stop for a bit to talkâ€”to listen. It was just what you did for a neighbor, he told himself; a normal kindness.

But he should have taken more notice. Now he recalled Jamieâ€™s thoughtful glance over the supper table, the breath taken as though to say something, when Roger had asked Claire for a salve for wee Orrie McCallumâ€™s rashâ€”and then Claireâ€™s glance at Brianna, and Jamieâ€™s closing his mouth, whatever heâ€™d thought of saying left unspoken.

â€œTheyâ€™ll all believe me.â€ For the girl to have said that, there must have been talk already. Likely Jamie had heard it; he could only hope that Bree hadnâ€™t.

The crooked chimney came in sight above the laurels, the smoke a nearly transparent wisp that made the clear air above the rooftree seem to quiver, as though the cabin were enchanted, might vanish with a blink.

The worst of it was that he knew precisely how it had happened. He had a weakness for young mothers, a terrible tenderness toward them, a desire to take care of them. The fact that he knew exactly why he harbored such an urgeâ€”the memory of his own young mother, who had died saving his life during the Blitzâ€”didnâ€™t help.

It was a tenderness that had nearly cost him his life at Alamance, when that bloody-minded fool William Buccleigh MacKenzie had mistaken Rogerâ€™s concern for Morag MacKenzie for . . . well, all right, heâ€™d kissed her, but only on the forehead, and for Godâ€™s sake, she was his own many-times-great-grannie . . . and the thundering idiocy of nearly being killed by your own great-great-etc.-grandfather for molesting his wife . . . it had cost him his voice, and he should have learned his lesson, but he hadnâ€™t, not well enough.

Suddenly furious with himselfâ€”and with Malva Christie, the malicious little chitâ€”he picked up a stone from the trail and flung it down the mountain, into the stream. It struck another in the water, bounced twice, and vanished into the rushing gurgle.

His visits to the McCallums had to stop, at once. He saw that clearly. Another way would have to be found for them . . . but he had to come once more, to explain. Amy would understand, he thoughtâ€”but how to explain to Aidan what reputation was, and why gossip was a deadly sin, and why Roger couldnâ€™t come anymore to fish or show him how to build things. . . .

Cursing steadily under his breath, he made the last short, steep ascent and came into the ragged, overgrown little dooryard. Before he could call out to announce his presence, though, the door flew open.

â€œRoger Mac!â€ Amy McCallum half-fell down the step and into his arms, gasping and weeping. â€œOh, you came, you came! I prayed for someone to come, but I didna think anyone would, in time, and heâ€™d die, but yeâ€™ve come, God be thankit!â€

â€œWhat is it? Whatâ€™s wrong? Is wee Orrie taken sick?â€ He got hold of her arms, steadying her, and she shook her head, so violently that her cap slid half off.

â€œAidan,â€ she gasped. â€œItâ€™s Aidan.â€



AIDAN MCCALLUM lay doubled up on my surgery table, white as a sheet, making little gasping groans. My first hopeâ€”green apples or gooseberriesâ€”vanished with a closer look at him. I was fairly sure what I had here, but appendicitis shares symptoms with a number of other conditions. A classic case does, however, have one striking aspect.

â€œCan you unfold him, just for a moment?â€ I looked at his mother, hovering over him on the verge of tears, but it was Roger who nodded and came to put his hands on Aidanâ€™s knees and shoulders, gently persuading him to lie flat.

I put a thumb in his navel, my little finger on his right hipbone, and pressed his abdomen sharply with my middle finger, wondering for a second as I did so whether McBurney had yet discovered and named this diagnostic spot. Pain in McBurneyâ€™s Spot was a specific diagnostic symptom for acute appendicitis. I pressed Aidanâ€™s stomach there, then I released the pressure, he screamed, arched up off the table, and doubled up like a jackknife.

A hot appendix for sure. Iâ€™d known Iâ€™d encounter one sometime. And with a mixed sense of dismay and excitement, I realized that the time had come for me finally to use the ether. No doubt about it, and no choice; if the appendix wasnâ€™t removed, it would rupture.

I glanced up; Roger was supporting little Mrs. McCallum with a hand under her elbow; she clutched the baby close to her chest, wrapped in its bundle. Sheâ€™d need to stay; Aidan would need her.

â€œRogerâ€”get Lizzie to come mind the baby, will you? And then run as fast as you can to the Christiesâ€™; Iâ€™ll need Malva to come and help.â€

The most extraordinary expression flitted across his face; I couldnâ€™t interpret it, but it was gone in an instant, and I didnâ€™t have time to worry about it. He nodded and left without a word, and I turned my attention to Mrs. McCallum, asking her the questions I needed answered before I cut into her small sonâ€™s belly.



IT WAS ALLAN CHRISTIE who opened the door to Rogerâ€™s brusque knock. A darker, leaner version of his owl-faced father, he blinked slowly at the question as to Malvaâ€™s whereabouts.

â€œWhy . . . sheâ€™s gone to the stream,â€ he said. â€œGathering rushes, she said.â€ He frowned. â€œWhy do ye want her?â€

â€œMrs. Fraser needs her to come and help withâ€”with something.â€ Something moved inside; the back door opening. Tom Christie came in, a book in his hand, the page heâ€™d been reading caught between two fingers.

â€œMacKenzie,â€ he said, with a short jerk of the head in acknowledgment. â€œDid ye say Mrs. Fraser is wanting Malva? Why?â€ He frowned as well, the two Christies looking exactly like a pair of barn owls contemplating a questionable mouse. â€œOnly that wee Aidan McCallumâ€™s taken badly, and sheâ€™d be glad of Malvaâ€™s help. Iâ€™ll go and find her.â€

Christieâ€™s frown deepened, and he opened his mouth to speak, but Roger had already turned, hurrying into the trees before either of them could stop him.

He found her fairly quickly, though every moment spent searching seemed an eternity. How long did it take an appendix to burst? She was knee-deep in the stream, skirts kirtled high and her rush basket floating beside her, tethered by an apron string. She didnâ€™t hear him at first, deafened by the flow of the water. When he called her name more loudly, her head jerked up in alarm, and she raised the rush knife, gripped tightly in her hand.

The look of alarm faded when she saw who it was, though she kept a wary eye on himâ€”and a good grip on the knife, he saw. His summons was received with a flash of interest.

â€œThe ether? Really, sheâ€™s going to cut him?â€ she asked eagerly, wading toward him.

â€œYes. Come on; Iâ€™ve already told your father Mrs. Fraser needs you. We neednâ€™t stop.â€

Her face changed at that.

â€œYe told him?â€ Her brow creased for a moment. Then she bit her lip and shook her head.

â€œI canâ€™t,â€ she said, raising her voice above the sound of the stream.

â€œYes, ye can,â€ he said, as encouragingly as possible, and stretched out a hand to help her. â€œCome on; Iâ€™ll give ye a hand with your things.â€

She shook her head more decidedly, pink lower lip poking out a bit.

â€œNo. My fatherâ€”heâ€™ll no have it.â€ She glanced in the direction of the cabin, and he turned to look, but it was all right; neither Allan nor Tom had followed him. Yet.

He kicked off his shoes and stepped into the icy creek, the stones rolling, hard and slippery under his feet. Malvaâ€™s eyes widened and her mouth fell open as he bent and grabbed her basket, ripped it from her apron string, and tossed it onto the bank. Then he took the knife from her hand, thrust it through his belt, grabbed her round the waist, and picking her up, splashed ashore with her, disregarding the kicking and squealing.

â€œYouâ€™re coming with me,â€ he said, grunting as he set her down. â€œYe want to walk, or do I carry you?â€

He thought she seemed more intrigued than horrified at this proposal, but she shook her head again, backing away from him.

â€œI canâ€™tâ€”truly! Heâ€™llâ€”heâ€™ll beat me if he finds out Iâ€™ve been meddling wiâ€™ the ether.â€

That checked him momentarily. Would he? Perhaps. But Aidanâ€™s life was at stake.

â€œHe wonâ€™t find out, then,â€ he said. â€œOr if he does, Iâ€™ll see to it that he does ye no harm. Come, for Godâ€™s sakeâ€”thereâ€™s no time to be wasting!â€

Her small pink mouth compressed itself in stubbornness. No time for scruples, then. He leaned down to bring his face close to hers and stared her in the eye.

â€œYouâ€™ll come,â€ he said, fists curling, â€œor I tell your father and your brother about you and Bobby Higgins. Say what ye like about meâ€”I donâ€™t care. But if ye think your father would beat you for helping Mrs. Fraser, whatâ€™s he likely to do if he hears yeâ€™ve been snogging Bobby?â€

He didnâ€™t know what the eighteenth-century equivalent of snogging was, but plainly she understood him. And if sheâ€™d been anywhere near his own size, she would have knocked him down, if he read the dangerous light in those big gray eyes correctly.

But she wasnâ€™t, and after an instantâ€™s consideration, she bent, dried her legs on her skirts, and shuffled hurriedly into her sandals.

â€œLeave it,â€ she said briefly, seeing him stoop for the basket. â€œAnd give me back my knife.â€

It might have been simply an urge to keep some influence over her until she was safely in the surgeryâ€”surely he wasnâ€™t afraid of her. He put a hand to the knife at his belt, though, and said, â€œLater. When itâ€™s done.â€

She didnâ€™t bother arguing, but scampered up the bank ahead of him and headed for the Big House, the soles of her sandals flapping against her bare heels.



I HAD MY FINGERS on the brachial pulse in Aidanâ€™s armpit, counting. His skin was very hot to the touch, maybe a temperature of 101, 102. The pulse was strong, though rapid . . . slowing as he went further under. I could feel Malva counting under her breath, so many drops of ether, so long a pause before the next . . . I lost my own count of the pulse, but it didnâ€™t matter; I was taking it into myself, feeling my own pulse begin to beat in the same rhythm, and it was normal, steady.

He was breathing well. The little abdomen rose and fell slightly under my hand, and I could feel the muscles relaxing by the moment, everything except the tense, distended belly, the visible ribs arching high above it as he breathed. I had the sudden illusion that I could push my hand straight through the wall of his abdomen and touch the swollen appendix, could see it in my mind, throbbing malignantly in the dark security of its sealed world. Time, then.

Mrs. McCallum made a small sound when I took up the scalpel, a louder one when I pressed it down into the pale flesh, still gleaming wet with the alcohol Iâ€™d swabbed it with, like a fishâ€™s belly yielding to the gutting knife.

The skin parted easily, blood welling in that odd, magical way, seeming to appear from nowhere. He had almost no fat beneath it; the muscles were right there, dark red, resilient to the touch. There were other people in the room; I felt them vaguely. I had no attention to spare, though. Every sense I had was focused on the small body under my hands. Someone stood at my shoulder, thoughâ€”Bree?

â€œGive me a retractorâ€”yes, that thing.â€ Yes, it was Bree; a long-fingered hand, wet with disinfectant, picked up the claw-shaped thing and put it in my waiting left hand. I missed the services of a good surgical nurse, but weâ€™d manage.

â€œHold that, just there.â€ I nosed the blade between the muscle fibers, splitting them easily, and then pinched up the thick soft gleam of the peritoneum, lifted it and sliced it.

His innards were very warm, sucking wet around two probing fingers. Soft squish of intestine, small half-firm lumps of matter felt through their walls, the brush of bone against my knuckleâ€”he was so small, there wasnâ€™t much room to feel around. I had my eyes closed, concentrating on touch alone. The cecum had to be right under my fingers, that was the curve of the large intestine I could feel, inert but live, like a sleeping snake. Behind? Below? I probed carefully, opened my eyes, and peered closely into the wound. He wasnâ€™t bleeding badly, but the wound was still awash. Ought I take the time to cauterize the small bleeders? I glanced at Malva; she was frowning in concentration, her lips moving silently, countingâ€”and she had one hand on the pulse in his neck, keeping track.

â€œCautery ironâ€”a small one.â€ A momentâ€™s pause; with the flammability of ether in mind, I had doused the hearth and put the brazier across the hall, in Jamieâ€™s study. Bree was quick, though; I had it in my hand in seconds. A wisp of smoke rose from his belly and the sizzle of seared flesh struck into the thick warm smell of blood. I glanced up to hand the iron back to Bree, and saw Mrs. McCallumâ€™s face, all eyes, staring.

I blotted away the blood with a handful of lint, looked againâ€”my fingers were still holding what I thought . . . all right.

â€œAll right,â€ I said out loud, triumphant. â€œGot you!â€ Very carefully, I hooked a finger under the curve of the cecum and pulled a section of it up through the wound, the inflamed appendix sticking out from it like an angry fat worm, purple with inflammation.

â€œLigature.â€

I had it now. I could see the membrane down the side of the appendix and the blood vessels feeding it. Those had to be tied off first; then I could tie off the appendix itself and cut it away. Difficult only because of the small size, but no real problem . . .

The room was so still, I could hear the tiny hisses and pops from the charcoal in the brazier across the hall. Sweat was running down behind my ears, between my breasts, and I became dimly aware that my teeth were sunk in my lower lip.

â€œForceps.â€ I pulled the purse-string stitch tight, and taking the forceps, poked the tied-off stump of the appendix neatly up into the cecum. I pressed this firmly back into his belly and took a breath.

â€œHow long, Malva?â€

â€œA bit more than ten minutes, maâ€™am. Heâ€™s all right.â€ She took her eyes off the ether mask long enough to dart a quick smile at me, then took up the dropping bottle, lips resuming her silent count.

Closing up was quick. I painted the sutured wound with a thick layer of honey, wrapped a bandage tightly round his body, tucked warm blankets over him and breathed.

â€œTake off the mask,â€ I said to Malva, straightening up. She made no reply, and I looked at her. She had raised the mask, was holding it in both hands before her, like a shield. But she wasnâ€™t watching Aidan anymore; her eyes were fixed on her father, standing rigid in the doorway.



TOM CHRISTIE looked back and forth from the small naked body on the table to his daughter. She took an uncertain step back, still clutching the ether mask. His head twisted, piercing me with a fierce gray look.

â€œWhatâ€™s to do here?â€ he demanded. â€œWhat are ye doing to that child?â€

â€œSaving his life,â€ I replied tartly. I was still vibrating from the intensity of the surgery, and in no mood for rannygazoo. â€œDid you want something?â€

Christieâ€™s thin lips pressed tight, but before he could reply, his son, Allan, pushed his way past into the room, and reaching his sister in a couple of strides, grabbed her by the wrist.

â€œCome away, ye wee gomerel,â€ he said roughly, jerking at her. â€œYeâ€™ve no business here.â€

â€œLet go of her.â€ Roger spoke sharply, and took hold of Allanâ€™s shoulder, to pull him away. Allan whirled on his heel and punched Roger in the stomach, short and sharp. Roger made a hollow crowing noise, but didnâ€™t crumple. Instead, he slugged Allan Christie in the jaw. Allan reeled backward, knocking over the little table of instrumentsâ€”blades and retractors clattered over the floor in a swash of falling metal, and the jar of catgut ligatures in alcohol smashed on the boards, spraying glass and liquid everywhere.

A soft thump from the floor made me look down. Amy McCallum, overcome by ether fumes and emotion, had passed out.

I hadnâ€™t time to do anything about that; Allan bounced back with a wild swing, Roger ducked, caught the rush of the younger Christieâ€™s body, and the two of them staggered backward, hit the sill, and fell out of the open window, entangled.

Tom Christie made a low growling noise and hurried toward the window. Malva, seizing her chance, ran out the door; I heard her footsteps pattering hastily down the hall toward the kitchenâ€”and, presumably, the back door.

â€œWhat on earth . . . ?â€ Bree said, looking at me.

â€œDonâ€™t look at me,â€ I said, shaking my head. â€œI have no idea.â€ Which was true; I did, however, have a sinking feeling that my involving Malva in the operation had a lot to do with it. Tom Christie and I had reached something like rapprochement, following my operation on his handâ€”but that didnâ€™t mean he had altered his views on the ungodliness of ether.

Bree drew herself abruptly upright, stiffening. A certain amount of grunting, gasping, and incoherent half-insults outside indicated that the fight was continuingâ€”but Allan Christieâ€™s raised voice had just called Roger an adulterer.

Brianna glanced sharply at the huddled form of Amy McCallum, and I said a very bad word to myself. Iâ€™d heard a few sidelong remarks about Rogerâ€™s visits to the McCallumsâ€”and Jamie had come close to saying something to Roger about it, but I had dissuaded him from interfering, telling him that Iâ€™d take up the matter tactfully with Bree. I hadnâ€™t had the chance, though, and nowâ€”

With a last unfriendly look at Amy McCallum, Bree strode out the door, plainly intending to take a hand in the fight. I clutched my brow and must have moaned, for Tom Christie turned sharply from the window.

â€œAre ye ill, mistress?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said, a little wanly. â€œJust . . . look, Tom. Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™ve caused trouble, asking Malva to help me. She has a real gift for healing, I thinkâ€”but I didnâ€™t mean to persuade her into doing something you didnâ€™t approve of.â€

He gave me a bleak look, which he then transferred to Aidanâ€™s slack body. The look sharpened suddenly.

â€œIs that child dead?â€ he asked.

â€œNo, no,â€ I said. â€œI gave him ether; heâ€™s just gone asleeâ€”â€

My voice dried in my throat, as I noticed that Aidan had chosen this inconvenient moment to stop breathing.

With an incoherent cry, I shoved Tom Christie out of the way and fell on Aidan, gluing my mouth over his and pressing the heel of my hand hard in the center of his chest.

The ether in his lungs flowed over my face as I took my mouth away, making my head swim. I gripped the edge of the table hard with my free hand, putting my mouth back on his. I could not black out, I couldnâ€™t.

My vision swam and the room seemed to be revolving slowly round me. I clung doggedly to consciousness, though, urgently blowing into his lungs, feeling the tiny chest under my hand rise gently, then fall.

It couldnâ€™t have been more than a minute, but a minute filled with nightmare, everything spinning round me, the feel of Aidanâ€™s flesh the only solid anchor in a whirl of chaos. Amy McCallum stirred on the floor beside me, rose swaying to her kneesâ€”then fell on me with a shriek, pulling at me, trying to get me off her son. I heard Tom Christieâ€™s voice, raised in command, trying to calm her; he must have pulled her away, for suddenly her grip on my leg was gone.

I blew into Aidan once moreâ€”and this time, the chest under my hand twitched. He coughed, choked, coughed again, and started simultaneously to breathe and to cry. I stood up, head spinning, and had to hold on to the table to avoid falling.

I saw a pair of figures before me, black, distorted, with gaping mouths that opened toward me, filled with sharp fangs. I blinked, staggering, and took deep gulps of air. Blinked again, and the figures resolved themselves into Tom Christie and Amy McCallum. He was holding her round the waist, keeping her back.

â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ I said, my own voice sounding strange and far off. â€œHeâ€™s all right. Let her come to him.â€

She flung herself at Aidan with a sob, pulling him into her arms. Tom Christie and I stood staring at each other over the wreckage. Outside, everything had gone quiet.

â€œDid ye just raise that child from the dead?â€ he asked. His voice was almost conversational, though his feathery brows arched high.

I wiped a hand across my mouth, still tasting the sickly sweetness of the ether.

â€œI suppose so,â€ I said.

â€œOh.â€

He stared at me, blank-faced. The room reeked of alcohol, and it seemed to sear my nasal lining. My eyes were watering a little; I wiped them on my apron. Finally, he nodded, as though to himself, and turned to go.

I had to see to Aidan and his mother. But I couldnâ€™t let him go without trying to mend things for Malva, so far as I could.

â€œTomâ€”Mr. Christie.â€ I hurried after him, and caught him by the sleeve. He turned, surprised and frowning.

â€œMalva. Itâ€™s my fault; I sent Roger to bring her. You wonâ€™tâ€”â€ I hesitated, but couldnâ€™t think of any tactful way to put it. â€œYou wonâ€™t punish her, will you?â€

The frown deepened momentarily, then lifted. He shook his head, very slightly, and with a small bow, detached his sleeve from my hand.

â€œYour servant, Mrs. Fraser,â€ he said quietly, and with a last glance at Aidanâ€”presently demanding foodâ€”he left.



BRIANNA DABBED THE wet corner of a handkerchief at Rogerâ€™s lower lip, split on one side, swollen and bleeding from the impact of some part of Allan Christie.

â€œItâ€™s my fault,â€ he said, for the third time. â€œI should have thought of something sensible to tell them.â€

â€œShut up,â€ she said, beginning to lose her precarious grip on her patience. â€œIf you keep talking, it wonâ€™t stop bleeding.â€ It was the first thing sheâ€™d said to him since the fight.

With a mumbled apology, he took the handkerchief from her and pressed it to his mouth. Unable to keep still, though, he got up and went to the open door of the cabin, looking out.

â€œHeâ€™s not still hanging around, is he? Allan?â€ She came to look over his shoulder. â€œIf he is, leave him alone. Iâ€™ll goâ€”â€

â€œNo, heâ€™s not,â€ Roger interrupted her. Hand still pressed to his mouth, he nodded toward the Big House, at the far end of the sloped clearing. â€œItâ€™s Tom.â€

Sure enough, Tom Christie was standing on the stoop. Just standing, apparently deep in thought. As they watched, he shook his head like a dog shedding water, and set off with decision in the direction of his own place.

â€œIâ€™ll go and talk to him.â€ Roger tossed the handkerchief at the table.

â€œOh, no, you wonâ€™t.â€ She grabbed him by the arm as he turned toward the door. â€œYou stay out of it, Roger!â€

â€œIâ€™m not going to fight him,â€ he said, patting her hand in what he plainly thought a reassuring manner. â€œBut Iâ€™ve got to talk to him.â€

â€œNo, you donâ€™t.â€ She tightened her grip on his arm, and pulled, trying to bring him back to the hearth. â€œYouâ€™ll just make it worse. Leave them alone.â€

â€œNo, I wonâ€™t,â€ he said, irritation beginning to show on his face. â€œWhat do ye mean, Iâ€™ll make it worse? What dâ€™ye think I am?â€

That wasnâ€™t a question she wanted to answer right this minute. Vibrating with emotion from the tension of Aidanâ€™s surgery, the explosion of the fight, and the niggling bur of Allanâ€™s shouted insult, she barely trusted herself to speak, let alone be tactful.

â€œDonâ€™t go,â€ she repeated, forcing herself to lower her voice, speak calmly. â€œEveryoneâ€™s upset. At least wait until theyâ€™ve settled down. Better yet, wait â€™til Da comes back. He canâ€”â€

â€œAye, he can do everything better than I can, I know that fine,â€ Roger replied caustically. â€œBut itâ€™s me that promised Malva sheâ€™d come to no harm. Iâ€™m going.â€ He yanked at his sleeve, hard enough that she felt the underarm seam give way.

â€œFine!â€ She let go, and slapped him hard on the arm. â€œGo! Take care of everybody in the world but your own family. Go! Bloody go!â€

â€œWhat?â€ He stopped, scowling, caught between anger and puzzlement.

â€œYou heard me! Go!â€ She stamped her foot, and the jar of dauco seeds, left too near the edge of the shelf, fell off and smashed on the floor, scattering tiny black seeds like pepper grains. â€œNow look what youâ€™ve done!â€

â€œWhat Iâ€™veâ€”â€

â€œNever mind! Just never mind. Get out of here.â€ She was puffing like a grampus with the effort not to cry. Her cheeks were hot with blood and her eyeballs felt red, bloodshot, so hot that she felt she might sear him with a lookâ€”certainly she wished she could.

He hovered, clearly trying to decide whether to stay and conciliate his disgruntled wife, or rush off in chivalrous protection of Malva Christie. He took a hesitant step toward the door, and she dived for the broom, making stupid, high-pitched squeaks of incoherent rage as she swung it at his head.

He ducked, but she got him on the second swing, catching him across the ribs with a thwack. He jerked in surprise at the impact, but recovered fast enough to catch the broom on the next swing. He yanked it out of her hand, and with a grunt of effort, broke it over his knee with a splintering crack.

He threw the pieces clattering at her feet and glared at her, angry but self-possessed.

â€œWhat in the name of God is the matter with you?â€

She drew up tall and glared back.

â€œWhat I said. If youâ€™re spending so much time with Amy McCallum that itâ€™s common talk youâ€™re having an affair with herâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™m what?â€ His voice broke with outrage, but there was a shifty look in his eyes that gave him away.

â€œSo youâ€™ve heard it, tooâ€”havenâ€™t you?â€ She didnâ€™t feel triumphant at having caught him out; more a sense of sick fury.

â€œYou canâ€™t possibly think thatâ€™s true, Bree,â€ he said, his voice pitched uncertainly between angry repudiation and pleading.

â€œI know it isnâ€™t true,â€ she said, and was furious to hear her own voice as shaky and cracked as his was. â€œThatâ€™s not the effing point, Roger!â€

â€œThe point,â€ he repeated. His black brows were drawn down, his eyes sharp and dark beneath them.

â€œThe point,â€ she said, gulping air, â€œis that youâ€™re always gone. Malva Christie, Amy McCallum, Marsali, Lizzieâ€”you even go help Ute McGillivray, for Godâ€™s sake!â€

â€œWho else is to do it?â€ he asked sharply. â€œYour father or your cousin might, ayeâ€”but theyâ€™ve to be gone to the Indians. Iâ€™m here. And Iâ€™m not always gone,â€ he added, as an afterthought. â€œIâ€™m home every night, am I not?â€

She closed her eyes and clenched her fists, feeling the nails dig into her palms.

â€œYouâ€™ll help any woman but me,â€ she said, opening her eyes. â€œWhy is that?â€

He gave her a long, hard look, and she wondered for an instant whether there was such a thing as a black emerald.

â€œMaybe I didnâ€™t think ye needed me,â€ he said. And turning on his heel, he left.

THE CALLING




THE WATER LAY CALM as melted silver, the only movement on it the shadows of the evening clouds. But the hatch was about to rise; you could feel it. Or perhaps, Roger thought, what he felt was the expectation in his father-in-law, crouched like a leopard on the bank of the trout pool, pole and fly at the ready for the first sign of a ripple.

â€œLike the pool at Bethesda,â€ he said, amused.

â€œOh, aye?â€ Jamie answered, but didnâ€™t look at him, his attention fixed on the water.

â€œThe one where an angel would go down into the pool and trouble the water now and then. So everyone sat about waiting, so as to plunge in the minute the water began to stir.â€

Jamie smiled, but still didnâ€™t turn. Fishing was serious business.

That was good; heâ€™d rather not have Jamie look at him. But heâ€™d have to hurry if he meant to say something; Fraser was already paying out the line to make a practice cast or two.

â€œI thinkâ€”â€ He stopped himself, correcting. â€œNo, I donâ€™t think. I know. I wantâ€”â€ His air ran out in a wheeze, annoying him; the last thing he wanted was to sound in any way doubtful about what he was saying. He took a huge breath, and the next words shot out as though fired from a pistol. â€œI mean to be a minister.â€

Well, then. Heâ€™d said it out loud. He glanced upward, involuntarily, but sure enough, the sky hadnâ€™t fallen. It was hazed and riffled with mareâ€™s tails, but the blue calm of it showed through and the ghost of an early moon floated just above the mountainâ€™s shoulder.

Jamie glanced thoughtfully at him, but didnâ€™t seem shocked or taken aback. That was some small comfort, he supposed.

â€œA minister. A preacher, dâ€™ye mean?â€

â€œWell . . . aye. That, too.â€

The admission disconcerted him. He supposed he would have to preach, though the mere notion of it was terrifying.

â€œThat, too?â€ Fraser repeated, looking at him sideways.

â€œAye. I meanâ€”a minister does preach, of course.â€ Of course. What about? How? â€œBut thatâ€™s notâ€”I mean, thatâ€™s not the main thing. Not why Iâ€”I have to do it.â€ He was getting flustered, trying to explain clearly something that he could not even explain properly to himself.

He sighed, and rubbed a hand over his face.

â€œAye, look. Ye recall Grannie Wilsonâ€™s funeral, of course. And the McCallums?â€

Jamie merely nodded, but Roger thought perhaps a flicker of understanding showed in his eyes.

â€œIâ€™ve done . . . a few things. A bit like that, when it was needed. Andâ€”â€ He twitched a hand, unsure even how to begin describing things like his meeting with Hermon Husband on the banks of the Alamance, or the conversations had with his dead father, late at night.

He sighed again, made to toss a pebble into the water, and stopped himself, just in time, when he saw Jamieâ€™s hand tense round his fishing pole. He coughed, feeling the familiar choke and rasp in his throat, and closed his hand around the pebble.

â€œThe preaching, aye, I suppose Iâ€™ll manage. But itâ€™s the other thingsâ€”oh, God, this sounds insane, and I do believe I may be. But itâ€™s the burying and the christening and theâ€”theâ€”maybe just being able to help, even if itâ€™s only by listening and praying.â€

â€œYe want to take care of them,â€ Jamie said softly, and it wasnâ€™t a question, but rather an acceptance.

Roger laughed a little, unhappily, and closed his eyes against the sparkle of the sun off the water.

â€œI donâ€™t want to do it,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s the last thing I thought of, and me growing up in a ministerâ€™s house. I mean, I ken what itâ€™s like. But someone has to do it, and I am thinking itâ€™s me.â€

Neither of them spoke for a bit. Roger opened his eyes and watched the water. Algae coated the rocks, wavering in the current like locks of mermaidâ€™s hair. Fraser stirred a little, drawing back his rod.

â€œDo Presbyterians believe in the sacraments, would ye say?â€

â€œYes,â€ Roger said, surprised. â€œOf course we do. Have ye neverâ€”â€ Well, no. He supposed in fact Fraser never had spoken to anyone not a Catholic, regarding such matters. â€œWe do,â€ he repeated. He dipped a hand gently in the water, and wiped it across his brow, so the coolness ran down his face and down his neck inside his shirt.

â€œItâ€™s Holy Orders I mean, ken?â€ The drowned fly swam through the water, a tiny speck of red. â€œWill ye not need to be ordained?â€

â€œOh, I see. Aye, I would. Thereâ€™s a Presbyterian academy in Mecklenburg County. Iâ€™ll go there and speak with them about it. Though Iâ€™m thinking it willna take such a time; Iâ€™ve the Greek and Latin already, and for what itâ€™s worthâ€â€”he smiled, despite himselfâ€”â€œIâ€™ve a degree from Oxford University. Believe it or not, I was once thought an educated man.â€

Jamieâ€™s mouth twitched at the corner as he drew back his arm and snapped his wrist. The line sailed out, a lazy curve, and the fly settled. Roger blinked; sure enoughâ€”the surface of the pool was beginning to pucker and shiver, tiny ripples spreading out from the rising hatch of mayflies and damselflies.

â€œHave ye spoken to your wife about it?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, staring across the pool.

â€œWhy not?â€ There was no tone of accusation in the question; more curiosity. Why, after all, should he have chosen to talk to his father-in-law first, rather than his wife?

Because you know what it is to be a man, he thought, and she doesnâ€™t. What he said, though, was another version of the truth.

â€œI donâ€™t want her to think me a coward.â€

Jamie made a small â€œhmphâ€ noise, almost surprise, but didnâ€™t reply at once, concentrating on reeling in his line. He took the sodden fly from the hook, then hesitated over the collection on his hat, finally choosing a delicate green thing with a curving wisp of black feather.

â€œDâ€™ye think she would?â€ Not waiting for an answer, Fraser stood and whipped the line up and back, sending the fly out to drift down over the center of the pool, lighting like a leaf on the water.

Roger watched as he brought it in, playing it over the water in a jerky dance. The Reverend had been a fisherman. All at once, he saw the Ness and its sparkling riffles, running clear brown over the rocks, Dad standing in his battered waders, reeling in his line. He was choked with longing. For Scotland. For his father. For one more dayâ€”just oneâ€”of peace.

The mountains and the green wood rose up mysterious and wild around them, and the hazy sky unfurled itself over the hollow like angelâ€™s wings, silent and sunlit. But not peaceful; never peace, not here.

â€œDo you believe usâ€”Claire and Brianna and meâ€”about the war thatâ€™s coming?â€

Jamie laughed shortly, gaze fixed on the water.

â€œIâ€™ve eyes, man. It doesna take either prophet or witch to see it standing on the road.â€

â€œThat,â€ said Roger, giving him a curious look, â€œis a very odd way of putting it.â€

â€œIs it, so? Is that no what the Bible says? When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, standing where it ought not, then let them in Judaea flee to the mountains?â€

Let him who readeth understand. Memory supplied the missing part of the verse, and Roger became aware, with a small sense of cold in the bone, that Jamie did indeed see it standing on the road, and recognized it. Nor was he using figures of speech; he was describing, precisely, what he sawâ€”because he had seen it before.

The sound of small boys yelling in joy drifted across the water, and Fraser turned his head a little, listening. A faint smile touched his mouth, then he looked down into the moving water, seeming to grow still. The ropes of his hair stirred against the sunburned skin of his neck, in the same way that the leaves of the mountain ash moved above.

Roger wanted suddenly to ask Jamie whether he was afraid, but kept silence. He knew the answer, in any case.

It doesnâ€™t matter. He breathed deep, and felt the same answer, to the same question, asked of himself. It didnâ€™t seem to come from anywhere, but was just there inside him, as though he had been born with it, always known it.

It doesnâ€™t matter. You will do it anyway.

They stayed for some time in silence. Jamie cast twice more with the green fly, then shook his head and muttered something, reeled it in, changed it for a Dun Fly, and cast again. The little boys charged past on the other bank, naked as eels, giggling, and disappeared through the bushes.

Really odd, Roger thought. He felt all right. Still having not the slightest idea what he meant to do, exactly, still seeing the drifting cloud coming toward them, and now knowing much more about what lay within it. But still all right.

Jamie had a fish on the line. He brought it in fast, and jerked it shining and flapping onto the bank, where he killed it with a sharp blow on a rock before tucking it into his creel.

â€œDâ€™ye mean to turn Quaker?â€ Jamie asked seriously.

â€œNo.â€ Roger was startled by the question. â€œWhy do you ask that?â€

Jamie made the odd little half-shrugging gesture that he sometimes used when uncomfortable about something, and didnâ€™t speak again until heâ€™d made the new cast.

â€œYe said ye didna want Brianna to think ye coward. Iâ€™ve fought by the side of a priest before.â€ One side of his mouth turned up, wry. â€œGranted, he wasna much of a swordsman, the Monsignor, and he couldna hit the broad side of a barn wiâ€™ a pistolâ€”but he was game enough.â€

â€œOh.â€ Roger scratched the side of his jaw. â€œAye, I take your meaning. No, I canâ€™t fight with an army, I donâ€™t think.â€ Saying it, he felt a sharp pang of regret. â€œBut take up arms in defense ofâ€”of those who need it . . . I can square that with my conscience, aye.â€

â€œThatâ€™s all right, then.â€

Jamie reeled in the rest of the line, shook water from the fly, and stuck the hook back into his hat. Laying the line aside, he rummaged in the creel and pulled out a stoneware bottle. He sat down with a sigh, pulled the cork with his teeth, spat it into his hand, and offered Roger the bottle.

â€œItâ€™s a thing Claire says to me, now and again,â€ he explained, and quoted: â€œMalt does more than Milton can, to justify Godâ€™s ways to man.â€

Roger lifted an eyebrow.

â€œEver read Milton?â€

â€œA bit. Sheâ€™s right about it.â€

â€œYe ken the next lines?â€ Roger lifted the bottle to his lips. â€œAle, man, aleâ€™s the stuff to drink, For fellows whom it hurts to think.â€

A subterranean laugh moved through Fraserâ€™s eyes.

â€œThis must be whisky, then,â€ he said. â€œIt only smells like beer.â€

It was cool and dark and pleasantly bitter, and they passed the bottle to and fro, not saying much of anything, until the ale was gone. Jamie put the cork thriftily back in, and tucked the empty bottle away in the creel.

â€œYour wife,â€ he said thoughtfully, rising and hitching the strap of the creel onto his shoulder.

â€œAye?â€ Roger picked up the battered hat, bestrewn with flies, and gave it to him. Jamie nodded thanks, and set it on his head.

â€œShe has eyes, too.â€

M-I-C-




FIREFLIES LIT THE GRASS, the trees, and floated through the heavy air in a profusion of cool green sparks. One lighted on Briannaâ€™s knee; she watched it pulse, on-off, on-off, and listened to her husband telling her he meant to be a minister.

They were sitting on the stoop of their cabin as the dusk thickened into night. Across the big clearing, the whoops of small children at play sounded in the bushes, high and cheerful as hunting bats.

â€œYou . . . uh . . . could say something,â€ Roger suggested. His head was turned, looking at her. There was enough light yet to see his face, expectant, slightly anxious.

â€œWell . . . give me a minute. I sort of wasnâ€™t expecting this, you know?â€

That was true, and it wasnâ€™t. Certainly, she hadnâ€™t consciously thought of such a thing, yet now that heâ€™d stated his intentionsâ€”and he had, she thought; he wasnâ€™t asking her permissionâ€”she wasnâ€™t at all surprised. It was less a change than a recognition of something that had been there for some timeâ€”and in a way, it was a relief to see it and know it for what it was.

â€œWell,â€ she said, after a long moment of consideration, â€œI think thatâ€™s good.â€

â€œYe do.â€ The relief in his voice was palpable.

â€œYes. If youâ€™re helping all these women because God told you to, thatâ€™s better than doing it because youâ€™d rather be with them than with me.â€

â€œBree! Ye canâ€™t think that, that Iâ€”â€ He leaned closer, looking anxiously into her face. â€œYe donâ€™t, do you?â€

â€œWell, only sometimes,â€ she admitted. â€œIn my worse moments. Not most of the time.â€ He looked so anxious that she reached up and cupped her hand to the long curve of his cheek; the stubble of his beard was invisible in this light, but she could feel it, soft and tickling against her palm.

â€œYouâ€™re sure?â€ she said softly. He nodded, and she saw his throat move as he swallowed.

â€œIâ€™m sure.â€

â€œAre you afraid?â€

He smiled a little at that.

â€œYeah.â€

â€œIâ€™ll help,â€ she said firmly. â€œYou tell me how, and Iâ€™ll help.â€

He took a deep breath, his face lightening, though his smile was rueful.

â€œI donâ€™t know how,â€ he said. â€œHow to do it, I mean. Let alone what you might do. Thatâ€™s what scares me.â€

â€œMaybe not,â€ she said. â€œBut youâ€™ve been doing it, anyway, havenâ€™t you? Do you need to do anything formal about this, though? Or can you just announce youâ€™re a minister, like those TV preachers, and start taking up the collection right away?â€

He smiled at the joke, but answered seriously.

â€œBloody Romanist. Ye always think no one else has any claim to sacraments. We do, though. Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™ll go to the Presbyterian Academy, see what I need to do about ordination. As for taking up the collectionâ€”I expect this means Iâ€™ll never be rich.â€

â€œI sort of wasnâ€™t expecting that, anyway,â€ she assured him gravely. â€œDonâ€™t worry; I didnâ€™t marry you for your money. If we need more, Iâ€™ll make it.â€

â€œHow?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know. Not selling my body, probably. Not after what happened to Manfred.â€

â€œDonâ€™t even joke about that,â€ he said. His hand came down over hers, large and warm.

Aidan McCallumâ€™s high, piercing voice floated through the air, and a sudden thought struck her.

â€œYourâ€”your, um, flock . . .â€ The word struck her funny bone, and she giggled, despite the seriousness of the question. â€œWill they mind that Iâ€™m a Catholic?â€ She turned to him suddenly, another thought coming rapidly in its wake. â€œYou donâ€™tâ€”you arenâ€™t asking me to convert?â€

â€œNo, Iâ€™m not,â€ he said quickly, firmly. â€œNot in a million years. As for what they might thinkâ€”or sayâ€”â€ His face twitched, caught between dismay and determination. â€œIf theyâ€™re not willing to accept it, well . . . they can just go to hell, thatâ€™s all.â€

She burst out laughing, and he followed her, his laugh cracked, but without restraint.

â€œThe Ministerâ€™s Cat is an irreverent cat,â€ she teased. â€œAnd how do you say that in Gaelic?â€

â€œIâ€™ve no idea. But the Ministerâ€™s Cat is a relieved cat,â€ he added, still smiling. â€œI didnâ€™t know what ye might think about it.â€

â€œIâ€™m not totally sure what I do think about it,â€ she admitted. She squeezed his hand lightly. â€œBut I see that youâ€™re happy.â€

â€œIt shows?â€ He smiled, and the last of the evening light glowed briefly in his eyes, a deep and lambent green.

â€œIt shows. Youâ€™re sort of . . . lighted up inside.â€ Her throat felt tight. â€œRogerâ€”you wonâ€™t forget about me and Jem, will you? I donâ€™t know that I can compete with God.â€

He looked thunderstruck at that.

â€œNo,â€ he said, his hand tightening on hers, hard enough to make her ring cut into her flesh. â€œNot ever.â€

They sat silent for a little, the fireflies drifting down like slow green rain, their silent mating song lighting the darkening grass and trees. Rogerâ€™s face was fading as the light failed, though she still saw the line of his jaw, set in determination.

â€œI swear to ye, Bree,â€ he said. â€œWhatever Iâ€™m called to nowâ€”and God knows what that isâ€”I was called to be your husband first. Your husband and the father of your bairns above all thingsâ€”and that I always shall be. Whatever I may do, it will not ever be at the price of my family, I promise you.â€

â€œAll I want,â€ she said softly to the dark, â€œis for you to love me. Not because of what I can do or what I look like, or because I love youâ€”just because I am.â€

â€œPerfect, unconditional love?â€ he said just as softly. â€œSome would tell ye only God can love that wayâ€”but I can try.â€

â€œOh, I have faith in you,â€ she said, and felt the glow of him reach her own heart.

â€œI hope ye always will,â€ he said. He raised her hand to his lips, kissed her knuckles in formal salutation, his breath warm on her skin.

As though to test the resolution of his earlier declaration, Jemâ€™s voice rose and fell on the evening breeze, a small, urgent siren. â€œDadddeeeDaaaddeeeDAAADDDEEE . . .â€

Roger sighed deeply, leaned over, and kissed her, a momentâ€™s soft, deep connection, then rose to deal with the emergency of the moment.

She sat for a bit, listening. The sound of male voices came from the far end of the clearing, high and low, demand and question, reassurance and excitement. No emergency; Jem wanted to be lifted into a tree too high for him to climb alone. Then laughter, mad rustling of leavesâ€”oh, good grief, Roger was in the tree, too. They were all up there, hooting like owls.

â€œWhat are ye laughing at, a nighean?â€ Her father loomed out of the night, smelling of horses.

â€œEverything,â€ she said, scooching over to make room for him to sit beside her. It was true. Everything seemed suddenly bright, the candlelight from the windows of the Big House, the fireflies in the grass, the glow of Rogerâ€™s face when he told her his desire. She could still feel the touch of his mouth on hers; it fizzed in her blood.

Jamie reached up and fielded a passing firefly, holding it for a moment cupped in the dark hollow of his hand, where it flashed on and off, the cool light seeping through his fingers. Far off, she heard a brief snatch of her motherâ€™s voice, coming through an open window; Claire was singing â€œClementine.â€

Now the boysâ€”and Rogerâ€”were howling at the moon, though it was no more than a pale sickle on the horizon. She felt her fatherâ€™s body shake with silent laughter, too.

â€œIt reminds me of Disneyland,â€ she said on impulse.

â€œOh, aye? Whereâ€™s that?â€

â€œItâ€™s an amusement parkâ€”for children,â€ she added, knowing that while there were such things as amusement parks in places like London and Paris, these were purely adult places. No one ever thought of entertaining children now, beyond their own games and the occasional toy.

â€œDaddy and Mama took me there every summer,â€ she said, slipping back without effort to the hot, bright days and warm California nights. â€œThe trees all had little sparkling lights in themâ€”the fireflies reminded me.â€

Jamie spread his palm; the firefly, suddenly free, pulsed to itself once or twice, then spread its wings with a tiny whir and lifted into the air, floating up and away.

â€œDwelt a miner, forty-niner, and his daugh-ter, Clementine . . .â€

â€œWhat was it like, then?â€ he asked curiously.

â€œOh . . . it was wonderful.â€ She smiled to herself, seeing the brilliant lights of Main Street, the music and mirrors and beautiful, beribboned horses of King Arthurâ€™s Carrousel. â€œThere were . . . rides, we called them. A boat, where you could float through the jungle on a river, and see crocodiles and hippopotamuses and headhunters . . .â€

â€œHeadhunters?â€ he said, intrigued.

â€œNot real ones,â€ she assured him. â€œItâ€™s all make-believeâ€”but itâ€™s . . . well, itâ€™s a world to itself. When youâ€™re there, the real world sort of disappears; nothing bad can happen there. They call it â€˜The Happiest Place on Earthâ€™â€”and for a little while, it really seems that way.â€

â€œLight she was, and like a fairy, and her shoes were number nine, Herring boxes without topses, sandals were for Clementine.â€

â€œAnd youâ€™d hear music everywhere, all the time,â€ she said, smiling. â€œBandsâ€”groups of musicians playing instruments, horns and drums and thingsâ€”would march up and down the streets, and play in pavilions. . . .â€

â€œAye, that happens in amusement parks. Or it did, the once I was in one.â€ She could hear a smile in his voice, as well.

â€œMm-hm. And there are cartoon charactersâ€”I told you about cartoonsâ€”walking around. You can go up and shake hands with Mickey Mouse, orâ€”â€

â€œWith what?â€

â€œMickey Mouse.â€ She laughed. â€œA big mouse, life-sizeâ€”human-size, I mean. He wears gloves.â€

â€œA giant rat?â€ he said, sounding slightly stunned. â€œAnd they take the weans to play with it?â€

â€œNot a rat, a mouse,â€ she corrected him. â€œAnd itâ€™s really a person dressed up like a mouse.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ he said, not sounding terribly reassured.

â€œYes. And an enormous carrousel with painted horses, and a railroad train that goes through the Rainbow Caverns, where there are big jewels sticking out of the walls, and colored streams with red and blue water . . . and orange-juice bars. Oh, orange-juice bars!â€ She moaned softly in ecstatic remembrance of the cold, tart, overwhelming sweetness.

â€œIt was nice, then?â€ he said softly.

â€œThou art lost and gone forever, Dreadful sor-ry . . . Clementine.â€

â€œYes,â€ she said, sighed, and was silent for a moment. Then she leaned her head against his shoulder, and wrapped her hand around his arm, big and solid.

â€œYou know what?â€ she said, and he made a small interrogatory noise in reply.

â€œIt was niceâ€”it was greatâ€”but what I really, really loved about it was that when we were there, it was just the three of us, and everything was perfect. Mama wasnâ€™t worrying about her patients, Daddy wasnâ€™t working on a paperâ€”they werenâ€™t ever silent or angry with each other. Both of them laughedâ€”we all laughed, all the time . . . while we were there.â€

He made no reply, but tilted his head so it rested against hers. She sighed again, deeply.

â€œJemmy wonâ€™t get to go to Disneylandâ€”but heâ€™ll have that. A family that laughsâ€”and millions of little lights in the trees.â€

PRINCIPLES




From Fraserâ€™s Ridge, North Carolina,

on the Third day of July, Anno Domini 1774,

James Fraser, Esq.

To his Lordship, John Grey, at Mount Josiah

Plantation, in the colony of Virginia

My Dear Friend,

I cannot begin to express our Gratitude for your kind Behavior in sending a Draft drawn upon your own Bank, as advance Payment against the eventual Sale of the Objects I confided to your disposition. Mr. Higgins, in delivering this Document, was of course most tactfulâ€”and yet, I gathered from his anxious Demeanor and his efforts at Discretion that you may perhaps believe us to be in dire Straits. I hasten to assure you that this is not the Case; we will do well enough, so far as Matters of Victuals, Clothes, and the Necessities of Life.

I said that I would tell you the Details of the Affair, and I see that I must, if only to disabuse you of the Vision of rampant Starvation among my family and tenants.

Beyond a small legal Obligation requiring Cash, I have a Matter of Business in Hand, involving the acquisition of a Number of Guns. I had been in Hopes of acquiring these through the good offices of a Friend, but find that this Arrangement will no longer answer; I must look further abroad.

I and my Family are invited to a Barbecue in honor of Miss Flora MacDonald, the Heroine of the Risingâ€”you are familiar with the Lady, I believe? I recall your telling me once of your meeting with her in London, whilst she was imprisoned thereâ€”to take place next month at my auntâ€™s Plantation, River Run. As this Affair will be attended by a great many Scots, some coming from considerable Distances, I am in Hopes that with Cash in Hand, I may make Arrangements to procure the requisite Weapons via other Avenues. In re which, should your own Connexions suggest any such useful Avenues, I should be grateful to hear of them.

I write quickly, as Mr. Higgins has other Errands, but my Daughter bids me send herewith a box of Matchsticks, her own Invention. She has schooled Mr. Higgins most carefully in their Use, so if he does not burst inadvertently into Flame on the way back, he will be able to demonstrate them to you.





Your humble and obâ€™t. servant,





James Fraser

P.S. I require thirty Muskets, with as much Powder and Ammunition as may be possible. These need not be of the latest Manufacture, but must be well-kept and functional.



â€œâ€˜OTHER AVENUES?â€™â€ I said, watching him sand the letter before folding it. â€œYou mean smugglers? And if so, are you sure that Lord John will understand what you mean?â€

â€œI do, and he will,â€ Jamie assured me. â€œI ken a few smugglers myself, who bring things in through the Outer Banks. Heâ€™ll know the ones who come through Roanoke, thoughâ€”and thereâ€™s more business there, because of the blockade in Massachusetts. Goods come in through Virginia, and go north overland.â€

He took a half-burned beeswax taper from the shelf and held it to the coals in the hearth, then dripped soft brown wax in a puddle over the seam of the letter. I leaned forward and pressed the back of my left hand into the warm wax, leaving the mark of my wedding ring in it.

â€œDamn Manfred McGillivray,â€ he said, with no particular heat. â€œIt will be three times the cost, and I must get them from a smuggler.â€

â€œWill you ask about him, though? At the barbecue, I mean?â€ Flora MacDonald, the woman who had saved Charles Stuart from the English after Culloden, dressing him in her maidâ€™s clothes and smuggling him to a rendezvous with the French on the Isle of Skye, was a living legend to the Scottish Highlanders, and her recent arrival in the colony was the subject of vast excitement, news of it coming even as far as the Ridge. Every well-known Scot in the Cape Fear valleyâ€”and a good many from farther awayâ€”would be present at the barbecue to be held in her honor. No better place to spread the word for a missing young man.

He glanced up at me, surprised.

â€œOf course I will, Sassenach. What dâ€™ye think I am?â€

â€œI think youâ€™re very kind,â€ I said, kissing him on the forehead. â€œIf a trifle reckless. And I notice you carefully didnâ€™t tell Lord John why you need thirty muskets.â€

He gave a small snort, and swept the grains of sand carefully off the table into the palm of his hand.

â€œI dinna ken for sure myself, Sassenach.â€

â€œWhatever do you mean by that?â€ I asked, surprised. â€œDo you not mean to give them to Bird, after all?â€

He didnâ€™t answer at once, but the two stiff fingers of his right hand tapped gently on the tabletop. Then he shrugged, reached to the stack of journals and ledgers, and pulled out a paper, which he handed to me. A letter from John Ashe, who had been a fellow commander of militia during the War of the Regulation.

â€œThe fourth paragraph,â€ he said, seeing me frown at a recounting of the latest contretemps between the Governor and the Assembly. I obligingly skimmed down the page, to the indicated spot, and felt a small, premonitory shiver.

â€œA Continental Congress is proposed,â€ I read, â€œwith delegates to be sent from each colony. The lower house of the Connecticut Assembly has moved already to propose such men, acting through Committees of Correspondence. Some gentlemen with whom you are well-acquainted propose that North Carolina shall do likewise, and will meet to accomplish the matter in mid-August. I could wish that you would join us, friend, for I am convinced that your heart and mind must lie with us in the matter of liberty; surely such a man as yourself is no friend to tyranny.

â€œSome gentlemen with whom you are well-acquainted,â€ I repeated, putting down the letter. â€œDo you know who he means?â€

â€œI could guess.â€

â€œMid-August, he says. Before the barbecue, do you think, or after?â€

â€œAfter. One of the others sent me the date of the meeting. Itâ€™s to be in Halifax.â€

I put down the letter. The afternoon was still and hot, and the thin linen of my shift was damp, as were the palms of my hands.

â€œOne of the others,â€ I said. He shot me a quick glance, with a half-smile, and picked up the letter.

â€œIn the Committee of Correspondence.â€

â€œOh, naturally,â€ I said. â€œYou might have told me.â€ Naturally, he would have found a means of inveigling himself into the North Carolina Committee of Correspondenceâ€”the center of political intrigue, where the seeds of rebellion were being sownâ€”meanwhile holding a commission as Indian agent for the British Crown and ostensibly working to arm the Indians, in order to suppress precisely those seeds of rebellion.

â€œI am telling ye, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œThis is the first time theyâ€™ve asked me to meet wiâ€™ them, even in private.â€

â€œI see,â€ I said softly. â€œWill you go? Is itâ€”is it time?â€ Time to make the leap, declare himself openly as a Whig, if not yet a rebel. Time to change his public allegiance, and risk the brand of treason. Again.

He sighed deeply and rubbed a hand through his hair. Heâ€™d been thinking; the short hairs of several tiny cowlicks were standing on end.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ he said finally. â€œItâ€™s two years yet, no? The fourth of July, 1776â€”thatâ€™s what Brianna said.â€

â€œNo,â€ I said. â€œItâ€™s two years until they declare independenceâ€”but, Jamie, the fighting will have started already. That will be much too late.â€

He stared at the letters on the desk, and nodded bleakly.

â€œAye, it will have to be soon, then.â€

â€œIt would be likely safe enough,â€ I said hesitantly. â€œWhat you told me about Henderson buying land in Tennessee: if no oneâ€™s stopping him, I canâ€™t see anyone in the government being agitated enough to come up here and try to force us out. And surely not if you were only known to have met with the local Whigs?â€

He gave me a small, wry smile.

â€œItâ€™s no the government Iâ€™m worrit by, Sassenach. Itâ€™s the folk nearby. It wasna the Governor who hanged the Oâ€™Brians and burnt their house, ken? Nor was it Richard Brown, nor Indians. That wasna done for the sake of law nor profit; it was done for hate, and verra likely by someone who knew them.â€

That made a more pronounced chill skitter down my spine. There was a certain amount of political disagreement and discussion on the Ridge, all right, but it hadnâ€™t reached the stage of fisticuffs yet, let alone burning and killing.

But it would.

I remembered, all too well. Bomb shelters and ration coupons, blackout wardens and the spirit of cooperation against a dreadful foe. And the stories from Germany, France. People reported on, denounced to the SS, dragged from their housesâ€”others hidden in attics and barns, smuggled across borders.

In war, government and their armies were a threat, but it was so often the neighbors who damned or saved you.

â€œWho?â€ I said baldly.

â€œI could guess,â€ he said, with a shrug. â€œThe McGillivrays? Richard Brown? Hodgepileâ€™s friendsâ€”if he had any. The friends of any of the other men we killed? The Indian ye metâ€”Donner?â€”if heâ€™s still alive. Neil Forbes? Heâ€™s a grudge against Brianna, and she and Roger Mac would do well to remember it. Hiram Crombie and his lot?â€

â€œHiram?â€ I said dubiously. â€œGranted, he doesnâ€™t like you very muchâ€”and as for meâ€”but . . .â€

â€œWell, I do doubt it,â€ he admitted. â€œBut itâ€™s possible, aye? His people didna support the Jacobites at all; theyâ€™ll no be pleased at an effort to overthrow the King from this side of the water, either.â€

I nodded. Crombie and the rest would of necessity have taken an oath of loyalty to King George, before being allowed to travel to America. Jamie hadâ€”of necessityâ€”taken the same oath, as part of his pardon. And mustâ€”of an even greater necessityâ€”break it. But when?

Heâ€™d stopped drumming his fingers; they rested on the letter before him.

â€œI do trust yeâ€™re right, Sassenach,â€ he said.

â€œAbout what? What will happen? You know I am,â€ I said, a little surprised. â€œBree and Roger told you, too. Why?â€

He rubbed a hand slowly through his hair.

â€œIâ€™ve never fought for the sake of principle,â€ he said, reflecting, and shook his head. â€œOnly necessity. I wonder, would it be any better?â€

He didnâ€™t sound upset, merely curious, in a detached sort of way. Still, I found this vaguely disturbing.

â€œBut there is principle to it, this time,â€ I protested. â€œIn fact, it may be the first war ever fought over principle.â€

â€œRather than something sordid like trade, or land?â€ Jamie suggested, raising one eyebrow.

â€œI donâ€™t say trade and land havenâ€™t anything to do with it,â€ I replied, wondering precisely how Iâ€™d managed to become a defender of the American Revolutionâ€”an historical period I knew only from Briannaâ€™s school textbooks. â€œBut it goes well beyond that, donâ€™t you think? We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.â€

â€œWho said that?â€ he asked, interested.

â€œThomas Jefferson will say itâ€”on behalf of the new republic. The Declaration of Independence, itâ€™s called. Will be called.â€

â€œAll men,â€ he repeated. â€œDoes he mean Indians, as well, do ye think?â€

â€œI canâ€™t say,â€ I said, rather irritated at being forced into this position. â€œI havenâ€™t met him. If I do, Iâ€™ll ask, shall I?â€

â€œNever mind.â€ He lifted his fingers in brief dismissal. â€œIâ€™ll ask him myself, and I have the opportunity. Meanwhile, Iâ€™ll ask Brianna.â€ He glanced at me. â€œThough as to principle, Sassenachâ€”â€

He leaned back in his chair, folded his arms over his chest, and closed his eyes.

â€œAs long as but a hundred of us remain alive,â€ he said precisely, â€œnever will we on any conditions be brought under English rule. It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedomâ€”for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.â€

â€œThe Declaration of Arbroath,â€ he said, opening his eyes. He gave me a lopsided smile. â€œWritten some four hundred years ago. Speaking oâ€™ principles, aye?â€

He stood up then, but still remained standing by the battered table he used as a desk, looking down at Asheâ€™s letter.

â€œAs for my own principles . . .â€ he said, as though to himself, but then looked at me, as though suddenly realizing that I was still there.

â€œAye, I think I mean to give Bird the muskets,â€ he said. â€œThough I may have cause to regret it, and I find them pointing at me, two or three years hence. But he shall have them, and do with them what seems best, to defend himself and his people.â€

â€œThe price of honor, is it?â€

He looked down at me, with the ghost of a smile.

â€œCall it blood money.â€

FLORA MACDONALDâ€™S

BARBECUE




River Run Plantation

August 6, 1774

WHATEVER DID ONE SAY to an icon? Or an iconâ€™s husband, for that matter?

â€œOh, I shall faint, I know I shall.â€ Rachel Campbell was fluttering her fan hard enough to create a perceptible breeze. â€œWhatever shall I say to her?â€

â€œâ€˜Good day, Mrs. MacDonaldâ€™?â€ suggested her husband, a faint smile lurking at the corner of his withered mouth.

Rachel hit him sharply with her fan, making him chuckle as he dodged away. For all he was thirty-five years her senior, Farquard Campbell had an easy, teasing way with his wife, quite at odds with his usual dignified demeanor.

â€œI shall faint,â€ Rachel declared again, having evidently decided upon this as a definite social strategy.

â€œWell, ye must please yourself, of course, a nighean, but if ye do, it will have to be Mr. Fraser picking you up from the ground; my ancient limbs are scarcely equal to the task.â€

â€œOh!â€ Rachel cast a quick glance at Jamie, who smiled at her, then hid her blushes behind her fan. While plainly fond of her own husband, she made no secret of her admiration for mine.

â€œYour humble servant, madam,â€ Jamie gravely assured her, bowing.

She tittered. I shouldnâ€™t like to wrong the woman, but she definitely tittered. I caught Jamieâ€™s eye, and hid a smile behind my own fan.

â€œAnd what will you say to her, then, Mr. Fraser?â€

Jamie pursed his lips and squinted thoughtfully at the brilliant sun streaming through the elm trees that edged the lawn at River Run.

â€œOh, I suppose I might say that Iâ€™m glad the weather has kept fine for her. It was raining the last time we met.â€

Rachelâ€™s jaw dropped, and so did her fan, bouncing on the lawn. Her husband bent to pick it up for her, groaning audibly, but she had no attention to spare for him.

â€œYouâ€™ve met her?â€ she cried, eyes wide with excitement. â€œWhen? Where? With the prinâ€”with him?â€

â€œAh, no,â€ Jamie said, smiling. â€œOn Skye. Iâ€™d gone wiâ€™ my fatherâ€”a matter of sheep, it was. We chanced to meet Hugh MacDonald of Armadale in Portreeâ€”Miss Floraâ€™s stepfather, aye?â€”and heâ€™d brought the lass into the town with him, for a treat.â€

â€œOh!â€ Rachel was enchanted. â€œAnd was she beautiful and gracious as they say?â€

Jamie frowned, considering.

â€œWell, no,â€ he said. â€œBut sheâ€™d a terrible grippe at the time, and no doubt would have looked much improved without the red nose. Gracious? Well, I wouldna say so, really. She snatched a bridie right out of my hand and ate it.â€

â€œAnd how old were you both at the time?â€ I asked, seeing Rachelâ€™s mouth sag in horror.

â€œOh, six, maybe,â€ he said cheerfully. â€œOr seven. I doubt I should remember, save I kicked her in the shin when she stole my bridie, and she pulled my hair.â€

Recovering somewhat from the shock, Rachel was pressing Jamie for further reminiscences, a pressure he was laughingly deflecting with jokes.

Of course, he had come prepared to this occasion; all over the grounds, there were stories being exchangedâ€”humorous, admiring, longingâ€”of the days before Culloden. Odd, that it should have been the defeat of Charles Stuart, and his ignominious flight, that made a heroine of Flora MacDonald and united these Highland exiles in a way that they could never have achievedâ€”let alone sustainedâ€”had he actually won.

It struck me suddenly that Charlie was likely still alive, quietly drinking himself to death in Rome. In any real way, though, he was long since dead to these people who had loved or hated him. The amber of time had sealed him forever in that one defining moment of his lifeâ€”Bliadha Tearlach; â€œCharlieâ€™s Year,â€ it meant, and even now, I heard people call it that.

It was Floraâ€™s coming that was causing this flood of sentiment, of course. How strange for her, I thought, with a pang of sympathyâ€”and for the first time, wondered what on earth I might say to her myself.

I had met famous people beforeâ€”not the least of them the Bonnie Prince himself. But always before, I had met them when theyâ€”and Iâ€”were in the midst of their normal lives, not yet past the defining events that would make them famous, and thus still just people. Bar Louisâ€”but then, he was a king. There are rules of etiquette for dealing with kings, since after all, no one ever does approach them as normal people. Not even whenâ€”

I snapped my own fan open, hot blood bursting through my face and body. I breathed deeply, trying not to fan quite as frantically as Rachel, but wanting to.

I had not once, in all the years since it happened, ever specifically recalled those two or three minutes of physical intimacy with Louis of France. Not deliberately, God knew, and not by accident, either.

Yet suddenly, the memory of it had touched me, as suddenly as a hand coming out of the crowd to seize my arm. Seize my arm, lift my skirts, and penetrate me in a way much more shockingly intrusive than the actual experience had been.

The air around me was suffused with the scent of roses, and I heard the creak of the dress cage as Louisâ€™s weight pressed upon it, and heard his sigh of pleasure. The room was dark, lit by one candle; it flickered at the edge of vision, then was blotted out by the man between myâ€”

â€œChrist, Claire! Are ye all right?â€ I hadnâ€™t actually fallen down, thank God. I had reeled back against the wall of Hector Cameronâ€™s mausoleum, and Jamie, seeing me go, had leapt forward to catch hold of me.

â€œLet go,â€ I said, breathless, but imperative. â€œLet go of me!â€

He heard the note of terror in my voice, and slackened his grip, but couldnâ€™t bring himself to let go altogether, lest I fall. With the energy of sheer panic, I pulled myself upright, out of his grasp.

I still smelled roses. Not the cloying scent of rose oilâ€”fresh roses. Then I came to myself, and realized that I was standing next to a huge yellow brier rose, trained to climb over the white marble of the mausoleum.

Knowing that the roses were real was comforting, but I felt as though I stood still on the edge of a vast abyss, alone, separate from every other soul in the universe. Jamie was close enough to touch, and yet it was as though he stood an immeasurable distance away.

Then he touched me and spoke my name, insistently, and just as suddenly as it had opened, the gap between us closed. I nearly fell into his arms.

â€œWhat is it, a nighean?â€ he whispered, holding me against his chest. â€œWhatâ€™s frightened ye?â€ His own heart was thumping under my ear; Iâ€™d scared him, too.

â€œNothing,â€ I said, and an overwhelming wave of relief went over me, at the realization that I was safely in the present; Louis had gone back into the shadows, an unpleasant but harmless memory once more. The staggering sense of violation, of loss and grief and isolation, had receded, no more than a shadow on my mind. Best of all, Jamie was there; solid and physical and smelling of sweat and whisky and horses . . . and there. I hadnâ€™t lost him.

Other people were clustering round, curious, solicitous. Rachel fanned me earnestly, and the breeze of it felt soothing; I was drenched with sweat, wisps of hair clinging damply to my neck.

â€œQuite all right,â€ I murmured, suddenly self-conscious. â€œJust a bit faint . . . hot day . . .â€

A chorus of offers to fetch me wine, a glass of syllabub, lemon shrub, a burned feather, were all trumped by Jamieâ€™s production of a flask of whisky from his sporran. It was the three-year-old stuff, from the sherry casks, and I felt a qualm as the scent of it reached me, remembering the night we had got drunk together after he had rescued me from Hodgepile and his men. God, was I about to be hurled back into that pit?

But I wasnâ€™t. The whisky was merely hot and consoling, and I felt better with the first sip.

Flashback. Iâ€™d heard colleagues talk about it, arguing as to whether this was the same phenomenon as shell shock, and if it was, whether it truly existed, or should be dismissed as simply â€œnerves.â€

I shuddered briefly, and took another sip. It most assuredly existed. I felt much better, but I had been shaken to the core, and my bones still felt watery. Beyond the faint echoes of the experience itself was a much more unsettling thought. It had happened once before, when Ute McGillivray attacked me. Was it likely to happen again?

â€œShall I carry ye inside, Sassenach? Perhaps ye should lie down a bit.â€

Jamie had shooed away the well-wishers, had a slave fetch me a stool, and was now hovering over me like an anxious bumblebee.

â€œNo, Iâ€™m all right now,â€ I assured him. â€œJamie . . .â€

â€œAye, lass?â€

â€œYouâ€”when youâ€”do you . . .â€

I took a deep breathâ€”and another sip of whiskyâ€”and tried again.

â€œSometimes, I wake up during the night and see youâ€”strugglingâ€”and I think itâ€™s with Jack Randall. Is it a dream that you have?â€

He stared down at me for a moment, face blank, but trouble moving in his eyes. He glanced from side to side, but we were quite alone now.

â€œWhy?â€ he asked, low-voiced.

â€œI need to know.â€

He took a breath, swallowed, and nodded.

â€œAye. Sometimes itâ€™s dreams. Thatâ€™s . . . all right. I wake, and ken where I am, say a wee prayer, and . . . itâ€™s all right. But now and thenâ€”â€ He shut his eyes for a moment, then opened them. â€œI am awake. And yet I am there, with Jack Randall.â€

â€œAh.â€ I sighed, feeling at once terribly sad for him, and at the same time somewhat reassured. â€œThen Iâ€™m not losing my mind.â€

â€œYe think so?â€ he said dryly. â€œWell, Iâ€™m that glad to hear it, Sassenach.â€

He stood very close, the cloth of his kilt brushing my arm, so that I should have him for support, if I suddenly went faint again. He looked searchingly at me, to be sure that I wasnâ€™t going to keel over, then touched my shoulder and with a brief â€œSit stillâ€ went off.

Not far; just to the tables set up under the trees at the edge of the lawn. Ignoring the slaves arranging food for the barbecue, he leaned across a platter of boiled crayfish and picked up something from a tiny bowl. Then he was back, leaning down to take my hand. He rubbed his fingers together, and a pinch of salt sprinkled into my open palm.

â€œThere,â€ he whispered. â€œKeep it by ye, Sassenach. Whoever it is, heâ€™ll trouble ye no more.â€

I closed my hand over the damp grains, feeling absurdly comforted. Trust a Highlander to know precisely what to do about a case of daylight haunting! Salt, they said, kept a ghost in its grave. And if Louis was still alive, the other man, whoever he had been, that pressing weight in the dark, was surely dead.

There was a sudden rush of excitement, as a call came from the riverâ€”the boat had been sighted. As one, the crowd drew itself up on tiptoe, breathless with anticipation.

I smiled, but felt the giddy contagion of it touch me nonetheless. Then the pipes began to skirl, and my throat at once was tight with unshed tears.

Jamieâ€™s hand tightened on my shoulder, unconsciously, and I looked up to see him rub his knuckles hard across his upper lip, as he, too, turned toward the river.

I looked down, blinking to control myself, and as my vision cleared, I saw the grains of salt on the ground, carefully scattered before the gates of the mausoleum.



SHE WAS MUCH SMALLER than Iâ€™d thought. Famous people always are. Everyoneâ€”dressed in their best, and an absolute sea of tartanâ€”pressed close, awed past courtesy. I caught a glimpse of the top of her head, dark hair dressed high with white roses, and then it disappeared behind the thronged backs of well-wishers.

Her husband, Allan, was visible. A stoutly handsome man with gray-streaked black hair tied neatly back, he was standingâ€”I assumedâ€”behind her, bowing and smiling, acknowledging the flood of Gaelic compliment and welcome.

Despite myself, I felt the urge to rush forward and stare, with everyone else. I held firm, though. I was standing with Jocasta on the terrace; Mrs. MacDonald would come to us.

Sure enough; Jamie and Duncan were pushing their way firmly through the crowd, forming a flying wedge with Jocastaâ€™s black butler, Ulysses.

â€œThatâ€™s really her?â€ Brianna murmured at my shoulder, eyes fixed with interest on the seething multitude, from which the men had now extracted the guest of honor, escorting her from the dock, up the lawn, toward the terrace. â€œSheâ€™s smaller than I thought. Oh, itâ€™s too bad Roger isnâ€™t hereâ€”heâ€™d just die to see her!â€ Roger was spending a month at the Presbyterian Academy at Charlotte, having his qualifications for ordination examined.

â€œHe may get to see her another time,â€ I murmured back. â€œI hear theyâ€™ve bought a plantation near Barbecue Creek, by Mount Pleasant.â€ And they would stay in the colony for at least another year or two, but I didnâ€™t say that out loud; so far as the people here knew, the MacDonalds had immigrated permanently.

But I had seen the tall memorial stone on Skyeâ€”where Flora MacDonald had been born, and would someday die, disillusioned with America.

It wasnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™d met someone and known their fate, of courseâ€”but it was always unsettling. The crowd opened and she stepped out, small and pretty, laughing up at Jamie. He had a hand under her elbow, guiding her up onto the terrace, and made a gesture of introduction toward me.

She looked up, expectant, met my gaze dead on, and blinked, her smile momentarily fading. It was back in an instant, and she was bowing to me and I to her, but I did wonder what she had seen in my face?

But she turned at once to greet Jocasta, and introduce her grown daughters, Anne and Fanny, a son, a son-in-law, her husbandâ€”by the time she had accomplished the confusion of introduction, she was perfectly in command of herself, and greeted me with a charming, gentle smile.

â€œMrs. Fraser! I am so much obliged to meet you at last. I have heard such stories of your kindness and skill, I confess I am in awe to be in your presence.â€

It was said with so much warmth and sincerityâ€”she seizing me by the handsâ€”that I found myself responding, in spite of a cynical wonder as to who sheâ€™d been talking to about me. My reputation in Cross Creek and Campbelton was notorious, but not universally lauded, by any means.

â€œI had the honor of Dr. Fentimanâ€™s acquaintance at the subscription ball held for us in Wilmingtonâ€”so kind, so amazingly kind of everyone! We have been so well treated, since our arrivalâ€”and he was quite in raptures regarding yourâ€”â€

I should have liked to hear what had enraptured Fentimanâ€”our relations were still marked by a certain wariness, though we had reached a rapprochementâ€”but at this point, her husband spoke in her ear, desiring her to come and meet Farquard Campbell and some other prominent gentlemen, and with a regretful grimace, she squeezed my hands and departed, the brilliant public smile back in place.

â€œHuh,â€ Bree remarked, sotto voce. â€œLucky for her sheâ€™s still got most of her teeth.â€

That was in fact exactly what Iâ€™d been thinking, and I laughed, converting it into a hasty coughing fit as I saw Jocastaâ€™s head turn sharply toward us.

â€œSo thatâ€™s her.â€ Young Ian had come up on my other side, and was watching the guest of honor with an expression of deep interest. He was dressed in kilt, waistcoat, and coat for the occasion, his brown hair done up in a proper queue, and he looked quite civilized, bar the tattoos that looped across his cheekbones and over the bridge of his nose.

â€œThatâ€™s her,â€ Jamie agreed. â€œFionnaghalâ€”the Fair One.â€ There was a surprising note of nostalgia in his voice, and I glanced at him in surprise.

â€œWell, itâ€™s her proper name,â€ he said mildly. â€œFionnaghal. Itâ€™s only the English call her Flora.â€

â€œDid you have a crush on her when you were little, Da?â€ Brianna asked, laughing.

â€œA what?â€

â€œA tendresse,â€ I said, batting my eyelashes delicately at him over my fan.

â€œOch, dinna be daft!â€ he said. â€œI was seven years old, for Godâ€™s sake!â€ Nonetheless, the tips of his ears had gone quite pink.

â€œI was in love when I was seven,â€ Ian remarked, rather dreamily. â€œWiâ€™ the cook. Did ye hear Ulysses say as sheâ€™s brought a looking glass, Uncle? Given to her by Prince Tearlach, with his arms upon the back. Ulysses put it in the parlor, wiâ€™ two of the grooms to stand guard over it.â€

Sure enough, those people who werenâ€™t in the swirling crowd surrounding the MacDonalds were all pressing through the double doors into the house, forming a line of animated chatter down the hall to the parlor.

â€œSeaumais!â€

Jocastaâ€™s imperious voice put a stop to the teasing. Jamie gave Brianna an austere look, and went to join her. Duncan was detained in conversation with a small knot of prominent menâ€”I recognized Neil Forbes, the lawyer, as well as Cornelius Harnett and Colonel Mooreâ€”and Ulysses was nowhere in sightâ€”most likely dealing with the backstage logistics of a barbecue for two hundred peopleâ€”thus leaving Jocasta temporarily marooned. Her hand on Jamieâ€™s arm, she sailed off the terrace, heading for Allan MacDonald, who had become detached from his wife by the press of people round her, and was standing under a tree, looking vaguely affronted.

I watched them go across the lawn, amused by Jocastaâ€™s sense of theatrics. Her body servant, Phaedre, was dutifully followingâ€”and could plainly have guided her mistress. That wouldnâ€™t have had at all the same effect, though. The two of them together made heads turnâ€”Jocasta tall and slender, graceful despite her age and striking with her white hair piled high and her blue silk gown, Jamie with his Viking height and crimson Fraser tartan, both with those bold MacKenzie bones and catlike grace.

â€œColum and Dougal would be proud of their little sister,â€ I said, shaking my head.

â€œOh, aye?â€ Ian spoke absently, not attending. He was still watching Flora MacDonald, now accepting a bunch of flowers from one of Farquard Campbellâ€™s grandchildren, to general applause.

â€œNot jealous, are you, Mama?â€ Brianna teased, seeing me glance in the same direction.

â€œCertainly not,â€ I said with a certain amount of complacence. â€œAfter all, I have all my teeth, too.â€



I HAD MISSED HIM in the initial crush, but Major MacDonald was among the revelers, looking very flash in a brilliantly scarlet uniform coat and a new hat, lavish with gold lace. He removed this object and bowed low to me, looking cheerfulâ€”no doubt because I was unaccompanied by livestock, Adso and the white sow being both safely on Fraserâ€™s Ridge.

â€œYour servant, mum,â€ he said. â€œI saw that ye had a word with Miss Floraâ€”so charming, is she not? And a canty, handsome woman, as well.â€

â€œIndeed she is,â€ I agreed. â€œDo you know her, then?â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said, a look of profound satisfaction spreading across his weathered face. â€œI should not dare to the presumption of friendshipâ€”but believe I may stake a modest claim to acquaintancy. I accompanied Mrs. MacDonald and her family from Wilmington, and have had the great honor to assist in settling them in their present situation.â€

â€œDid you really?â€ I gave him an interested eye. The Major wasnâ€™t the type to be awed by celebrity. He was the type to appreciate its uses. So was Governor Martin, evidently.

The Major was watching Flora MacDonald now with a proprietary eye, noting with approval the way in which people clustered round her.

â€œShe has most graciously agreed to speak today,â€ he told me, rocking back a little on his bootheels. â€œWhere would be the best place, do you think, mum? From the terrace, as being the point of highest elevation? Or perhaps near the statue on the lawn, as being more central and allowing the crowd to surround her, thus increasing the chance of everyone hearing her remarks?â€

â€œI think sheâ€™ll have a sunstroke, if you put her out on the lawn in this weather,â€ I said, tilting my own broad-brimmed straw hat to shade my nose. It was easily in the nineties, in terms both of temperature and humidity, and my thin petticoats clung soddenly to my lower limbs. â€œWhat sort of remarks is she going to make?â€

â€œJust a brief address upon the subject of loyalty, mum,â€ he said blandly. â€œAh, there is your husband, talking to Kingsburgh; if youâ€™ll excuse me, mum?â€ Bowing, he straightened, put his hat back on, and strode down the lawn to join Jamie and Jocasta, who were still with Allan MacDonaldâ€”styled â€œKingsburgh,â€ in the Scottish fashion, for the name of his estate on Skye.

Food was beginning to be brought out: tureens of powsowdie and hotchpotchâ€”and an enormous tub of soup Ã  la Reine, a clear compliment to the guest of honorâ€”platters of fried fish, fried chicken, fried rabbit; venison collops in red wine, smoked sausages, Forfar bridies, inky-pinky, roast turkeys, pigeon pie; dishes of colcannon, stovies, turnip purry, roasted apples stuffed with dried pumpkin, squash, corn, mushroom pasties; gigantic baskets overflowing with fresh baps, rolls, and other breads . . . all this, I was well aware, merely as prelude to the barbecue whose succulent aroma was drifting through the air: a number of hogs, three or four beeves, two deer, and, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance, a wood bison, acquired God knew how or where.

A hum of pleasant anticipation rose around me, as people began metaphorically to loosen their belts, squaring up to the tables with a firm determination to do their duty in honor of the occasion.

Jamie was still stuck fast to Mrs. MacDonald, I saw; he was helping her to a dish of what looked from the distance to be broccoli salad. He looked up and saw me, beckoned me to join themâ€”but I shook my head, gesturing with my fan toward the buffet tables, where the guests were setting to in the businesslike manner of grasshoppers in a barley field. I didnâ€™t want to lose the opportunity of inquiring about Manfred McGillivray, before the stupor of satiety settled over the crowd.

I made my way purposefully into the fray, accepting tidbits offered to me by assorted servants and slaves, pausing to chat with any acquaintance I saw, particularly those from Hillsboro. Manfred had spent a great deal of time there, I knew, taking commissions for guns, delivering the finished products, and doing small jobs of repair. That was the most likely place for him to go, I thought. But no one I talked to had seen him, though most knew him.

â€œNice lad,â€ one gentleman told me, pausing momentarily in his potations. â€œAnd sore missed, too. Besides Robin, thereâ€™s few gunsmiths closer than Virginia.â€

I knew that, and knowing, wondered whether Jamie was having any luck in locating the muskets he needed. Perhaps Lord Johnâ€™s smuggling connections would be necessary.

I accepted a small pie from a passing slaveâ€™s tray, and wandered on, munching and chatting. There was much talk about a series of fiery articles that had appeared recently in the Chronicle, the local newspaper, whose proprietor, one Fogarty Simms, was spoken of with considerable sympathy.

â€œA rare plucked â€™un, is Simms,â€ said Mr. Goodwin, shaking his head. â€œBut I doubt me heâ€™ll stand. I spoke with him last week, and he told me heâ€™s in some fear of his skin. Thereâ€™ve been threats, aye?â€

From the tone of the gathering, I assumed that Mr. Simms must be a Loyalist, and this appeared to be true, from the various accounts I was given. There was talk, apparently, of a rival paper setting up, this to support the Whiggish agenda, with its incautious talk of tyranny and the overthrow of the King. No one knew quite who was behind the new venture, but there was talkâ€”and much indignation at the prospectâ€”that a printer was to be brought down from the north, where folk were notably given to such perverse sentiments.

The general consensus was that such persons wanted their backsides kicked, to bring them to their senses.

I hadnâ€™t sat down to eat formally, but after an hour of moving slowly through fields of champing jaws and wandering herds of hors dâ€™oeuvre trays, I felt as though Iâ€™d sat through a French royal banquetâ€”those occasions lasting so long that chamber pots were discreetly placed beneath the guestsâ€™ chairs, and where the occasional guest giving way and sliding beneath the table was discreetly ignored.

The present occasion was less formal, but not much less prolonged. After an hourâ€™s preliminary eating, the barbecue was raised steaming from the pits near the stable, and brought to the lawns on wooden trestles, mounted on the shoulders of slaves. The sight of immense sides of beef, pork, venison, and buffalo, gleaming with oil and vinegar and surrounded by the smaller charred carcasses of hundreds of pigeons and quail, was greeted with applause by the guests, all by this time drenched with the sweat of their efforts, but nothing daunted.

Jocasta, seated by her guest, looked deeply gratified by the sound of her hospitality being so warmly accepted, and leaned toward Duncan, smiling, putting a hand on his arm as she said something to him. Duncan had left off looking nervousâ€”the effect of a quart or two of beer, followed by most of a bottle of whiskyâ€”and seemed to be enjoying himself, too. He smiled broadly at Jocasta, then essayed a remark to Mrs. MacDonald, who laughed at whatever he said.

I had to admire her; she was besieged on all sides by people wanting a word, but she kept her poise admirably, being kind and gracious to everyoneâ€”though this meant sitting sometimes for ten minutes, a forkful of food suspended in air as she listened to some interminable story. At least she was in the shadeâ€”and Phaedre, dressed in white muslin, stood dutifully behind her with a huge fan made of palmetto fronds, making a breeze and keeping off the flies.

â€œLemon shrub, maâ€™am?â€ A wilting slave, gleaming with sweat, offered me yet another tray, and I took a glass. I was dripping with perspiration, my legs aching and my throat dried with talking. At this point, I didnâ€™t care what was in the glass, provided it was wet.

I changed my opinion instantly upon tasting it; it was lemon juice and barley water, and while it was wet, I was much more inclined to pour it down the neck of my gown than to drink it. I edged unobtrusively toward a laburnum bush, intending to pour the drink into it, but was forestalled by the appearance of Neil Forbes, who stepped out from behind it.

He was as startled to see me as I was to see him; he jerked back, and glanced hastily over his shoulder. I looked in the same direction, and caught sight of Robert Howe and Cornelius Harnett, making off in the opposite direction. Clearly, the three of them had been conferring secretly behind the laburnum bush.

â€œMrs. Fraser,â€ he said, with a short bow. â€œYour servant.â€

I curtsied in return, with a vague murmur of politeness. I would have slithered past him, but he leaned toward me, preventing my exit.

â€œI hear that your husband is collecting guns, Mrs. Fraser,â€ he said, his voice at a low and rather unfriendly pitch.

â€œOh, really?â€ I was holding an open fan, as was every other woman there. I waved it languidly before my nose, hiding most of my expression. â€œWho told you such a thing?â€

â€œOne of the gentlemen whom he approached to that end,â€ Forbes said. The lawyer was large and somewhat overweight; the unhealthy shade of red in his cheeks might be due to that, rather than to displeasure. Then again . . .

â€œIf I might impose so far upon your good nature, maâ€™am, I would suggest that you exert your influence upon him, so as to suggest that such a course is not the wisest?â€

â€œTo begin with,â€ I said, taking a deep breath of hot, damp air, â€œjust what course do you think heâ€™s embarked upon?â€

â€œAn unfortunate one, maâ€™am,â€ he said. â€œPutting the best complexion upon the matter, I assume that the guns he seeks are intended to arm his own company of militia, which is legitimate, though disturbing; the desirability of that course would rest upon his later actions. But his relations with the Cherokee are well-known, and there are rumors about that the weapons are destined to end in the hands of the savages, to the end that they may turn upon His Majestyâ€™s subjects who presume to offer objection to the tyranny, abuse, and corruption so rife among the officials who governâ€”if so loose a word may be employed to describe their actionsâ€”this colony.â€

I gave him a long look over the edge of my fan.

â€œIf I hadnâ€™t already known you were a lawyer,â€ I remarked, â€œthat speech would have done it. I think that you just said that you suspect my husband of wanting to give guns to the Indians, and you donâ€™t like that. On the other hand, if heâ€™s wanting to arm his own militia, that might be all rightâ€”providing that said militia acts according to your desires. Am I right?â€

A flicker of amusement showed in his deep-set eyes, and he inclined his head toward me in acknowledgment.

â€œYour perception astounds me, maâ€™am,â€ he said.

I nodded, and shut the fan.

â€œRight. And what are your desires, may I ask? I wonâ€™t ask why you think Jamie ought to take heed of them.â€

He laughed, his heavy face, already flushed with the heat, going a deeper shade of red beneath his neat tie-wig.

â€œI desire justice, maâ€™am; the downfall of tyrants and the cause of liberty,â€ he said. â€œAs must any honest man.â€

. . . freedom aloneâ€”which any honest man surrenders only with his life. The line echoed in my head, and must have shown on my face, for he looked keenly at me.

â€œI esteem your husband deeply, maâ€™am,â€ he said quietly. â€œYou will tell him what I have said?â€ He bowed and turned away, not waiting for my nod.

He hadnâ€™t guarded his voice when speaking of tyrants and liberty; I saw heads nearby turn, and here and there, men drew together, murmuring as they watched him go.

Distracted, I took a mouthful of lemon shrub, and was then obliged to swallow the nasty stuff. I turned to find Jamie; he was still near Allan MacDonald, but had moved a little aside, and was in private conversation with Major MacDonald.

Things were moving faster than I had thought. I had thought republican sentiment was still a minority in this part of the colony, but for Forbes to speak so openly in a public gathering, it was obviously gaining ground.

I turned back to look after the lawyer, and saw two men confront him, their faces tight with anger and suspicion. I was too far away to hear what was said, but their postures and expressions were eloquent. Words were exchanged, growing in heat, and I glanced toward Jamie; the last time I had attended a barbecue like this at River Run, in the prelude to the War of the Regulation, there had been a fistfight on the lawn, and I rather thought such an occurrence might be about to happen again. Alcohol, heat, and politics made for explosions of temper in any gathering, let alone one composed largely of Highlanders.

Such an explosion might have happenedâ€”more men were gathering round Forbes and his two opponents, fists curling in readinessâ€”had the boom of Jocastaâ€™s large gong not sounded from the terrace, making everyone look up in startlement.

The Major was standing on an upturned tobacco hogshead, hands raised in the air, beaming at the multitudes, face shining red with heat, beer, and enthusiasm.

â€œCeud mile fÃ ilte!â€ he called, and was greeted by enthusiastic applause. â€œAnd we wish a hundred thousand welcomes to our honored guests!â€ he continued in Gaelic, sweeping a hand toward the MacDonalds, who were now standing side by side near him, nodding and smiling at the applause. From their demeanor, I rather thought they were accustomed to this sort of reception.

A few more introductory remarksâ€”half-drowned in the enthusiastic cheersâ€”and Jamie and Kingsburgh lifted Mrs. MacDonald carefully up onto the barrel, where she swayed a little, but regained her balance, grabbing the heads of both men for stability, and smiling at the laughter of the audience.

She beamed at the crowd, who beamed back, en masse, and immediately quieted themselves in order to hear her.

She had a clear, high voice, and was obviously accustomed to speaking in publicâ€”a most unusual attribute in a woman of the time. I was too far away to hear every word, but had no trouble picking up the gist of her speech.

After graciously thanking her hosts, the Scottish community who had welcomed her family so warmly and generously, and the guests, she commenced an earnest exhortation against what she called â€œfactionalism,â€ urging her hearers to join in suppressing this dangerous movement, which could not but cause great unrest, threatening the peace and prosperity that so many of them had achieved in this fair land, they having risked everything to attain it.

And she was, I realized with a small shock, exactly right. Iâ€™d heard Bree and Roger arguing the pointâ€”why any of the Highlanders, who had suffered so much under English rule, should have fought on the English side, as many of them eventually would.

â€œBecause,â€ Roger had said patiently, â€œthey had something to lose, and damn little to gain. Andâ€”of all peopleâ€”they knew exactly what it was like to fight against the English. Ye think folk who lived through Cumberlandâ€™s cleansing of the Highlands, made it to America, and rebuilt their lives from nothing were eager to live through all that again?â€

â€œBut surely theyâ€™ll want to fight for freedom,â€ Bree had protested. He looked at her cynically.

â€œThey have freedom, a great deal more than theyâ€™ve ever seen in Scotland. They risk losing it in the event of a warâ€”and they know that very well. And then, of course,â€ heâ€™d added, â€œnearly all of them have sworn an oath of loyalty to the Crown. Theyâ€™d not break it lightly, surely not for something that looked like one more wild-eyedâ€”and doubtless short-livedâ€”political upheaval. Itâ€™s likeâ€”â€ His brow had furrowed as he looked for a suitable analogy.

â€œLike the Black Panthers, or the civil-rights movement. Anyone could see the idealistic pointâ€”but a lot of middle-class people found the whole thing threatening or frightening and just wished it would go away, so life could be peaceful.â€

The trouble, of course, was that life never was peacefulâ€”and this particular wild-eyed movement wasnâ€™t going to go away. I could see Brianna on the far side of the crowd, eyes narrowed in thoughtful speculation as she listened to Flora MacDonaldâ€™s high, clear voice, talking of the virtues of loyalty.

I heard a low sort of â€œHmph!â€ just to the side, behind me, and turning, saw Neil Forbes, his heavy features set in disapproval. He had reinforcements now, I saw; three or four other gentlemen stood close beside him, glancing to and fro but trying not to look as though they were. Gauging the mood of the crowd, I thought they were outnumbered by roughly two hundred to one, and the two hundred were growing steadily more entrenched in their opinions as the drink took hold and the speech went on.

Looking away, I caught sight again of Brianna, and realized that she was now looking at Neil Forbes, tooâ€”and he was looking back. Both taller than the people around them, they stared at each other over the heads of the intervening crowd, he with animosity, she with aloofness. She had rejected his suit a few years before, and had done so without tact. Forbes certainly hadnâ€™t been in love with herâ€”but he was a man with a fair degree of self-esteem, and not the sort to suffer such a public slight with philosophical resignation.

Brianna turned away, coolly, as though she had taken no notice of him, and spoke to the woman beside her. I heard him grunt again, say something in a low tone to his compatriotsâ€”and then the knot of them were leaving, rudely turning their backs on Mrs. MacDonald, who was still speaking.

Gasps and murmurs of indignation followed them, as they shoved their way through the thick-packed crowd, but no one offered to stop them, and the offense of their leaving was drowned by the outburst of prolonged applause that greeted the conclusion of the speechâ€”this accompanied by the starting up of bagpipes, the random firing of pistols into the air, organized cheering of â€œHip, hip, huzzay!â€ led by Major MacDonald, and such a general hullabaloo that no one would have noticed the arrival of an army, let alone the departure of a few disaffected Whigs.

I found Jamie in the shade of Hectorâ€™s mausoleum, combing out his hair with his fingers, preparatory to retying it.

â€œThat went with a bang, didnâ€™t it?â€ I asked.

â€œSeveral of them,â€ he said, keeping a wary eye on one obviously inebriated gentleman in the act of trying to reload his musket. â€œWatch that man, Sassenach.â€

â€œHeâ€™s too late to shoot Neil Forbes. Did you see him leave?â€

He nodded, deftly knotting the leather thong at his nape.

â€œHe couldna have come much closer to an open declaration, save heâ€™d got up on the barrel next to Fionnaghal.â€

â€œAnd that would have made him an excellent target.â€ I squinted at the red-faced gentleman, presently spilling gunpowder on his shoes. â€œI donâ€™t think he has any bullets.â€

â€œOh, well, then.â€ Jamie dismissed him with a wave of the hand. â€œMajor MacDonaldâ€™s in rare form, no? He told me heâ€™s arranged for Mrs. MacDonald to give such speeches here and there about the colony.â€

â€œWith himself as impresario, I take it.â€ I could just catch the gleam of MacDonaldâ€™s red coat among the press of well-wishers on the terrace.

â€œI daresay.â€ Jamie didnâ€™t seem pleased at the prospect. In fact, he seemed rather sober, his face shadowed by dark thoughts. His mood would not be improved by hearing about my conversation with Neil Forbes, but I told him anyway.

â€œWell, it couldna be helped,â€ he said with a small shrug. â€œIâ€™d hoped to keep the matter quiet, but wiâ€™ things as they are wiâ€™ Robin McGillivray, Iâ€™ve no real choice save to ask where I may, though that lets the matter be known. And talked about.â€ He moved again, restless.

â€œAre ye well, Sassenach?â€ he asked suddenly, looking at me.

â€œYes. But you arenâ€™t. What is it?â€

He smiled faintly.

â€œOch, itâ€™s nothing. Nothing I didna ken already. But itâ€™s different, no? Ye think yeâ€™re ready, and then ye meet it face to face, and would give anything to have it otherwise.â€

He looked out at the lawn, lifting his chin to point at the crowd. A sea of tartan flowed across the grass, the ladiesâ€™ parasols raised against the sun, a field of brightly colored flowers. In the shade of the terrace, a piper played on, the sound of his piobreachd a thin, piercing descant to the hum of conversation.

â€œI kent I should have to stand one day against a good many of them, aye? To fight friends and kin. But then I found myself standing there, wiâ€™ Fionnaghalâ€™s hand upon my head like a blessing, face to face wiâ€™ them all, and watching her words fall upon them, see the resolve growing in them . . . and all of a sudden, it was as though a great blade had come down from heaven between them and me, to cleave us forever apart. The day is comingâ€”and I can not stop it.â€

He swallowed, and looked down, away from me. I reached out to him, wanting to help, wanting to ease himâ€”and knowing that I couldnâ€™t. It was, after all, by my doing that he found himself here, in this small Gethsemane.

Nonetheless, he took my hand, not looking at me, and squeezed it hard, so the bones pressed together.

â€œLord, that this cup might pass from me?â€ I whispered.

He nodded, his gaze still resting on the ground, the fallen petals of the yellow roses. Then he looked at me, with a small smile but such pain in his eyes that I caught my breath, stricken to the heart.

Still, he smiled, and wiping his hand across his forehead, examined his wet fingers.

â€œAye, well,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s only water, not blood. Iâ€™ll live.â€

Perhaps you wonâ€™t, I thought suddenly, appalled. To fight on the winning side was one thing; to survive, quite another.

He saw the look on my face, and released the pressure on my hand, thinking he was hurting me. He was, but not physically.

â€œBut not my will be done, but Thine,â€ he said very softly. â€œI chose my way when I wed ye, though I kent it not at the time. But I chose, and cannot now turn back, even if I would.â€

â€œWould you?â€ I looked into his eyes as I asked, and read the answer there. He shook his head.

â€œWould you? For you have chosen, as much as I.â€

I shook my head, as well, and felt the small relaxation of his body as his eyes met mine, clear now as the brilliant sky. For the space of a heartbeat, we stood alone together in the universe. Then a knot of chattering girls drifted within earshot, and I changed the subject to something safer.

â€œHave you heard anything about poor Manfred?â€

â€œPoor Manfred, is it?â€ he gave me a cynical look.

â€œWell, he may be an immoral young hound, and have caused any amount of troubleâ€”but that doesnâ€™t mean he ought to die for it.â€

He looked as though he might not be in complete agreement with this sentiment, but let the matter lie, saying merely that heâ€™d asked, but so far without result.

â€œHeâ€™ll turn up, though,â€ he assured me. â€œLikely in the most inconvenient place.â€

â€œOh! Oh! Oh! That I should live to see such a day! I thank ye, sir, thank ye indeed!â€ It was Mrs. Bug, flushed with heat, beer, and happiness, fanning herself fit to burst. Jamie smiled at her.

â€œSo, were ye able to hear everything, then, mo chridhe?â€

â€œOh, indeed I was, sir!â€ she assured him fervently. â€œEvery word! Arch found me a lovely place, just by one of they tubs oâ€™ wee flowers, where I could hear and not be trampled.â€ She had nearly died of excitement when Jamie had offered to bring her down to the barbecue. Arch was coming, of course, and would go on to do errands in Cross Creek, but Mrs. Bug hadnâ€™t been off the Ridge since their arrival several years before.

Despite my disquiet over the profoundly Loyalist atmosphere that surrounded us, her bubbling delight was infectious, and I found myself smiling, Jamie and myself taking it in turns to answer her questions: she hadnâ€™t seen black slaves close-to before, and thought them exotically beautifulâ€”did they cost a great deal? And must they be taught to wear clothes and speak properly? For she had heard that Africa was a heathen place where folk went entirely naked and killed one another with spears, like as one would do with a boar, and if one wanted to speak of naked, that statue of the soldier laddie on the lawn was shocking, did we not think? And him wiâ€™ not a stitch behind his shield! And whyever was that womanâ€™s heid at his feet? And had I lookedâ€”her hair was made to look as if â€™twere snakes, of all horrid things! And who was Hector Cameron, whose tomb this was?â€”and made all of white marble, same as the tombs in Holyrood, imagine! Oh, Mrs. Innesâ€™s late husband? And when had she married Mr. Duncan, whom she had met, and such a sweet, kind-eyed man as he was, such a shame as he had lost his arm, was that in a battle of some type? Andâ€”oh, look! Mrs. MacDonaldâ€™s husbandâ€”and a fine figure of man he was, tooâ€”was going to talk, as well!

Jamie gave the terrace a bleak look. Sure enough, Allan MacDonald was stepping upâ€”merely onto a stool; no doubt the hogshead seemed extremeâ€”and a number of peopleâ€”far fewer than had attended his wife, but a respectable numberâ€”were clustering round attentively.

â€œWill ye no come and hear him?â€ Mrs. Bug was already in flight, hovering above the ground like a hummingbird.

â€œIâ€™ll hear well enough from here,â€ Jamie assured her. â€œYou go along then, a nighean.â€

She bumbled off, buzzing with excitement. Jamie gingerly touched both hands to his ears, testing to be sure they were still attached.

â€œIt was kind of you to bring her,â€ I said, laughing. â€œThe dear old thing probably hasnâ€™t had such fun in half a century.â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, grinning. â€œShe likelyâ€”â€

He stopped abruptly, frowning as he caught sight of something over my shoulder. I turned to look, but he was already moving past me, and I hurried to catch up.

It was Jocasta, white as milk, and disheveled in a way I had never seen her. She swayed unsteadily in the side doorway, and might have fallen, had Jamie not come up and taken quick hold of her, one arm about her waist to support her.

â€œJesus, Auntie. Whatâ€™s amiss?â€ He spoke quietly, not to draw attention, and was moving her back inside the house even as he spoke.

â€œOh, God, oh, merciful God, my head,â€ she whispered, hand spread over her face like a spider, so that her fingers barely touched the skin, cupping her left eye. â€œMy eye.â€

The linen blindfold that she wore in public was creased and blotched with moisture; tears were leaking out from under it, but she wasnâ€™t crying. Lacrimation: one eye was watering terribly. Both eyes were tearing, but much worse on the left; the edge of the linen was soaked, and wetness shone on that cheek.

â€œI need to look at her eye,â€ I said to Jamie, touching his elbow, and looking round in vain for any of the servants. â€œGet her to her sitting room.â€ That was closest, and all the guests were either outside or traipsing through the parlor to see the Princeâ€™s looking glass.

â€œNo!â€ It was almost a scream. â€œNo, not there!â€

Jamie glanced at me, one brow raised in puzzlement, but spoke soothingly to her.

â€œNay, Auntie, itâ€™s all right. Iâ€™ll bring ye to your own chamber. Come, then.â€ He stooped, and lifted her in his arms as though she were a child, her silk skirts falling over his arm with the sound of rushing water.

â€œTake her; Iâ€™ll be right there.â€ Iâ€™d spotted the slave named Angelina passing through the far end of the hall, and hurried to catch her up. I gave my orders, then rushed back toward the stairsâ€”pausing momentarily to glance into the small sitting room as I did so.

There was no one there, though the presence of scattered punch cups and the strong scent of pipe tobacco indicated that Jocasta had likely been holding court there earlier. Her workbasket stood open, some half-knitted garment dragged out and left to dangle carelessly down the side like a dead rabbit.

Children perhaps, I thought; several balls of thread had been pulled out, too, and lay scattered on the parquet floor, trailing their colors. I hesitatedâ€”but instinct was too much for me, and I hastily scooped up the balls of thread and dropped them back into the workbasket. I stuffed the knitting in on top, but jerked my hand back with an exclamation.

A small gash on the side of my thumb was welling blood. I put it in my mouth and sucked hard to apply pressure to the wound; meanwhile, I groped more cautiously in the depths of the basket with my other hand, to see what had cut me.

A knife, small but businesslike. Likely used to cut embroidery threads; there was a tooled-leather sheath for it, loose in the bottom of the basket. I slipped the knife back into its sheath, seized the needle case Iâ€™d come for, and closed the folding tabletop of the workbasket before hurrying for the stairs.

Allan MacDonald had finished his brief speech; there was a loud clatter of applause outside, with shouts and whoops of Gaelic approval.

â€œBloody Scots,â€ I muttered under my breath. â€œDonâ€™t they ever learn?â€

But I hadnâ€™t time to consider the implications of the MacDonaldsâ€™ rabble-rousing. By the time I reached the top of the stair, one slave was close behind me, puffing under the weight of my medicine box, and another was at the bottom, starting more cautiously up with a pan of hot water from the kitchen.

Jocasta was bent double in her big chair, moaning, lips pressed into invisibility. Her cap had come off and both hands moved restlessly to and fro through her disordered hair, as though looking helplessly for something to seize. Jamie was stroking her back, murmuring to her in Gaelic; he looked up with obvious relief as I came in.

I had long suspected that the cause of Jocastaâ€™s blindness was glaucomaâ€”rising pressure inside the eyeball that if untreated eventually damages the optic nerve. Now I was quite sure of it. More than that, I knew what form of the disease she had; she was plainly having an acute attack of closed-angle glaucoma, the most dangerous type.

There was no treatment for glaucoma now; the condition itself wouldnâ€™t be recognized for some time. Even if there had been, it was far too late; her blindness was permanent. There was, however, something I could do about the immediate situationâ€”and I was afraid Iâ€™d have to.

â€œPut some of this to steep,â€ I said to Angelina, grabbing the jar of goldenseal from my box and thrusting it into her hands. â€œAnd youâ€â€”I turned to the other slave, a man whose name I didnâ€™t knowâ€”â€œset the water to boil again, fetch me some clean rags, and put them in the water.â€

Even as I talked, Iâ€™d got out the tiny spirit lamp I carried in my case. The fire had been allowed to burn down on the hearth, but there were still live coals; I bent and lit the wick, then opened the needle case Iâ€™d taken from the sitting room and abstracted the largest needle in it, a three-inch length of steel, used for mending carpets.

â€œYou arenâ€™t . . .â€ Jamie began, then broke off, swallowing.

â€œI have to,â€ I said briefly. â€œThereâ€™s nothing else. Hold her hands.â€

He was nearly as pale as Jocasta, but he nodded and took hold of the clutching fingers, pulling her hands gently away from her head.

I lifted away the linen bandage. The left eye bulged noticeably beneath its lid, vividly bloodshot. Tears welled up round it and overflowed in a constant stream. I could feel the pressure inside the eyeball, even without touching it, and clenched my teeth in revulsion.

No help for it. With a quick prayer to Saint Clareâ€”who was, after all, patroness of sore eyes, as well as my own patron saintâ€”I ran the needle through the flame of the lamp, poured pure alcohol onto a rag, and wiped the soot from the needle.

Swallowing a sudden excess of saliva, I spread the eyelids of the affected eye apart with one hand, commended my soul to God, and shoved the needle hard into the sclera of the eye, near the edge of the iris.

There was a cough and a splattering on the floor nearby, and the stink of vomit, but I had no attention to spare. I withdrew the needle carefully, though as fast as I could. Jocasta had stiffened abruptly, frozen stiff, hands clawed over Jamieâ€™s. She didnâ€™t move at all, but made small, shocked panting sounds, as though afraid to move enough even to breathe.

There was a trickle of fluid from the eye, vitreous humor, faintly cloudy, just thick enough to be distinguishable as it flowed sluggishly across the wet surface of the sclera. I was still holding the eyelids apart; I plucked a rag from the goldenseal tea with my free hand, squeezed out the excess liquid, careless of where it went, and touched it gently to her face. Jocasta gasped at the touch of the warmth on her skin, pulled her hands free, and grasped at it.

I let go then, and allowed her to seize the warm rag, pressing it against her closed left eye, the heat of it some relief.

Light feet pounded up the stairs again, and down the hall; Angelina, panting, a handful of salt clutched to her bosom, a spoon in her other hand. I brushed the salt from her damp palm into the pan of warm water, and set her to stir it while it dissolved.

â€œDid you bring laudanum?â€ I asked her quietly. Jocasta was lying back in her chair, eyes closedâ€”but rigid as a statue, her eyelids squeezing tight, fists clenched in knots on her knees.

â€œI couldna find the laudanum, missus,â€ Angelina murmured to me, with a frightened glance at Jocasta. â€œI dinna ken who could be takinâ€™ itâ€”hainâ€™t nobody got the key but Mr. Ulysses and Miz Cameron herself.â€

â€œUlysses let you into the simples closet, thenâ€”so he knows that Mrs. Cameron is ill?â€

She nodded vigorously, setting the ribbon on her cap a-flutter.

â€œOh, yes, missus! He be bleezinâ€™, if he find out and I hainâ€™t told him. He say come fetch him quick, she want himâ€”otherwise, I tell Miz Cameron she hainâ€™t to worry none, he take care every single thing.â€

Jocasta let out a long sigh at this, her clenched fists relaxing a little.

â€œGod bless the man,â€ she murmured, eyes closed. â€œHe will take care of everything. I should be lost without him. Lost.â€

Her white hair was soaked at the temples, and sweat dripped from the ends of the tendrils that lay over her shoulder, making spots on the dark blue silk of her gown.

Angelina unlaced Jocastaâ€™s gown and stays and got them off. Then I had Jamie lay her down on the bed in her shift, with a thick layer of towels tucked round her head. I filled one of my rattlesnake syringes with the warm salt water, and with Jamie gingerly holding the lids of her eye apart, I was able to gently irrigate the eye, in hopes of perhaps preventing infection to the puncture wound. The wound itself showed as a tiny scarlet spot on the sclera, a small conjunctival bleb above it. Jamie couldnâ€™t look at it without blinking, I saw, and smiled at him.

â€œSheâ€™ll be all right,â€ I said. â€œYou can go, if you like.â€

Jamie nodded, turning to go, but Jocastaâ€™s hand shot out to stop him.

â€œNo, be staying, a chuisleâ€”if ye will.â€ This last was strictly for formâ€™s sake; she had him clutched by the sleeve, hard enough to turn her fingers white.

â€œAye, Auntie, of course,â€ he said mildly, and put his hand over hers, squeezing in reassurance. Still, she didnâ€™t let go until he had sat down beside her.

â€œWho else is there?â€ she asked, turning her head fretfully from side to side, trying to hear the telltale sounds of breathing and movement that would inform her. â€œHave the slaves gone?â€

â€œYes, theyâ€™ve gone back to help with the serving,â€ I told her. â€œItâ€™s only me and Jamie left.â€

She closed her eyes and drew a deep, shuddering breath, only then beginning to relax a little.

â€œGood. I must tell ye a thing, Nephew, and no one else must hear. Nieceâ€â€”she lifted a long white hand toward meâ€”â€œgo and be seeing as weâ€™re truly alone.â€

I went obediently to look out into the hall. No one was visible, though there were voices coming from a room down the hallâ€”laughter, and tremendous rustlings and thumpings, as young women chattered and rearranged their hair and clothing. I pulled my head back in and closed the door, and the sounds from the rest of the house receded at once, muffled into a distant rumble.

â€œWhat is it, then, Auntie?â€ Jamie was still holding her hand, one big thumb gently stroking the back of it, over and over, in the soothing rhythm Iâ€™d seen him use on skittish animals. It was less effective on his aunt than on the average horse or dog, though.

â€œIt was him. Heâ€™s here!â€

â€œWhoâ€™s here, Auntie?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know!â€ Her eyes rolled desperately to and fro, as though in a vain attempt to see through not only darkness, but walls, as well.

Jamie raised his brows at me, but he could see as well as I that she wasnâ€™t raving, incoherent as she sounded. She realized what she sounded like; I could see the effort in her face as she pulled herself together.

â€œHeâ€™s come for the gold,â€ she said, lowering her voice. â€œThe Frenchmanâ€™s gold.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ Jamie said cautiously. He darted a glance at me, one eyebrow raised, but I shook my head. She wasnâ€™t having hallucinations.

Jocasta sighed with impatience and shook her head, then stopped abruptly, with a muffled â€œOch!â€ of pain, putting both hands to her head as though to keep it on her shoulders.

She breathed deeply for a moment or two, her lips pressed tight together. Then she slowly lowered her hands.

â€œIt started last night,â€ she said. â€œThe pain in my eye.â€

Sheâ€™d waked in the night to a throbbing in her eye, a dull pain that spread slowly to the side of her head.

â€œItâ€™s come before, ken,â€ she explained. She had pushed herself up to a sitting position now, and was beginning to look a little better, though she still held the warm cloth to her eye. â€œIt began when I started to lose my sight. Sometimes it would be one eye, sometimes both. But I kent what was coming.â€

But Jocasta MacKenzie Cameron Innes was not a woman to allow mere bodily indisposition to interfere with her plans, let alone interrupt what promised to be the most scintillating social affair in Cross Creekâ€™s history.

â€œI was that disgusted,â€ she said. â€œAnd here Miss Flora MacDonald coming!â€

But the arrangements had all been made; the barbecued carcasses were roasting in their pits, hogsheads of ale and beer stood ready by the stables, and the air was full of the fragrance of hot bread and beans from the cookhouse. The slaves were well-trained, and she had full faith that Ulysses would manage everything. All she must do, sheâ€™d thought, was to stay on her feet.

â€œI didna want to take opium or laudanum,â€ she explained. â€œOr Iâ€™d fall asleep for sure. So I made do wiâ€™ the whisky.â€

She was a tall woman, and thoroughly accustomed to an intake of liquor that would have felled a modern man. By the time the MacDonalds arrived, sheâ€™d had the better part of a bottleâ€”but the pain was getting worse.

â€œAnd then my eye began to water so fierce, everyone would haâ€™ seen something was wrong, and I didna want that. So I came into my sitting room; Iâ€™d taken care to put a wee bottle of laudanum in my workbasket, in case the whisky should be not enough.

â€œFolk were swarming thick as lice outside, trying to catch a glimpse or a word with Miss MacDonald, but the sitting room was deserted, so far as I could tell, what wiâ€™ my head pounding and my eye fit to explode.â€ She said this last quite casually, but I saw Jamie flinch, the memory of what Iâ€™d done with the needle obviously still fresh. He swallowed and wiped his knuckles hard across his mouth.

Jocasta had quickly abstracted the bottle of laudanum, swallowed a few gulps, and then sat for a moment, waiting for it to take effect.

â€œI dinna ken if yeâ€™ve ever had the stuff, Nephew, but it gives ye an odd feeling, as though ye might be starting to dissolve at the edges. Take a drop too much, and ye begin to see things that arenâ€™t thereâ€”blind or notâ€”and hear them, too.â€

Between the effects of laudanum and liquor and the noise of the crowd outside, she hadnâ€™t noticed footsteps, and when the voice spoke near her, sheâ€™d thought for a moment that it was a hallucination.

â€œâ€˜So here ye are, lass,â€™ he said,â€ she quoted, and her face, already pale, blanched further at the memory. â€œâ€˜Remember me, do ye?â€™â€

â€œI take it ye did, Aunt?â€ Jamie asked dryly.

â€œI did,â€ she replied just as dryly. â€œIâ€™d heard that voice twice before. Once at the Gathering where your daughter was wedâ€”and once more than twenty years ago, in an inn near Coigach, in Scotland.â€

She lowered the wet cloth from her face and put it unerringly back into the bowl of warm water. Her eyes were red and swollen, raw against the pale skin, and looking terribly vulnerable in their blindnessâ€”but she had command of herself once more.

â€œAye, I did ken him,â€ she repeated.

She had recognized the voice at once as one knownâ€”but for a moment, could not place it. Then realization had struck her, and she had clutched the arm of her chair for support.

â€œWho are ye?â€ sheâ€™d demanded, with what force she could summon. Her heart was pounding in time to the throbbing in her head and eye, and her senses swimming in whisky and laudanum. Perhaps it was the laudanum that seemed to transform the sound of the crowd outside into the sound of a nearby sea, the noise of a slaveâ€™s footsteps in the hall to the thump of the landlordâ€™s clogs on the stairs of the inn.

â€œI was there. Truly there.â€ Despite the sweat that still ran down her face, I saw gooseflesh pebble the pale skin of her shoulders. â€œIn the inn at Coigach. I smelt the sea, and I heard the menâ€”Hector and Dougalâ€”I could hear them! Arguing together, somewhere behind me. And the man wiâ€™ the maskâ€”I could see him,â€ she said, and a ripple went up the back of my own neck as she turned her blind eyes toward me. She spoke with such conviction that for an instant, it seemed she did see.

â€œStanding at the foot of the stair, just as heâ€™d been twenty-five years ago, a knife in his hand and his eyes upon me through the holes in his mask.â€

And, â€œYe ken well enough who I am, lass,â€ heâ€™d said, and she had seemed to see his smile, though dimly she had known she only heard it in his voice; sheâ€™d never seen his face, even when she had her sight.

She was sitting up, half doubled over, arms crossed over her breast as though in self-defense and her white hair wild and tangled down her back.

â€œHeâ€™s come back,â€ she said, and shook with a sudden convulsive shudder. â€œHeâ€™s come for the goldâ€”and when he finds it, he will kill me.â€

Jamie laid a hand on her arm, in an attempt to calm her.

â€œNo one will kill ye while Iâ€™m here, Aunt,â€ he said. â€œSo this man came to ye in your sitting room, and ye kent him from his voice. What else did he say to ye?â€

She was still shivering, but not so badly. I thought it was as much reaction to massive amounts of laudanum and whisky as from fear.

She shook her head in the effort of recollection.

â€œHe saidâ€”he said he had come to take the gold to its rightful owner. That weâ€™d held it in trust, and while he didna grudge me what weâ€™d spent of it, Hector and meâ€”it wasna mine, had never been mine. I should tell him where it was, and he would see to the rest. And then he put his hand on me.â€ She ceased clutching herself, and held out one arm toward Jamie. â€œOn my wrist. Dâ€™ye see the marks there? Dâ€™ye see them, Nephew?â€ She sounded anxious, and it occurred to me suddenly that she might doubt the existence of the visitor herself.

â€œAye, Auntie,â€ Jamie said softly, touching her wrist. â€œThere are marks.â€

There were; three purplish smudges, small ovals where fingers had gripped.

â€œHe squeezed, and then twisted my wrist so hard I thought it had snapped. Then he let go, but he didna step back. He stayed over me, and I could feel the heat of his breath and the stink of tobacco on my face.â€

I had hold of her other wrist, feeling the pulse beat there. It was strong and rapid, but every once in a while would skip a beat. Hardly surprising. I did wonder how often she took laudanumâ€”and how much.

â€œSo I reached down into my workbasket, took my wee knife from its sheath, and went for his balls,â€ she concluded.

Taken by surprise, Jamie laughed.

â€œDid ye get him?â€

â€œYes, she did,â€ I said, before Jocasta could answer. â€œI saw dried blood on the knife.â€

â€œWell, that will teach him to terrorize a helpless blind woman, wonâ€™t it?â€ Jamie patted her hand. â€œYe did well, Auntie. Did he go, then?â€

â€œHe did.â€ The recounting of her success had steadied her a lot; she pulled her hand from my grip, in order to push herself up straighter against the pillows. She pulled away the towel still draped around her neck, and dropped it on the floor with a brief grimace of distaste.

Seeing that she was plainly feeling better, Jamie glanced at me, then rose to his feet.

â€œIâ€™ll go and see is anyone limping about the place, then.â€ At the door, he paused, though, turning back to Jocasta.

â€œAuntie. Ye said yeâ€™d met this fellow twice before? At the inn in Coigach where the men brought the gold ashoreâ€”and at the Gathering four years ago?â€

She nodded, brushing back the damp hair from her face.

â€œI did. â€™Twas on the last day. He came into my tent, while I was alone. I kent someone was there, though he didna speak at first, and I asked who was it? He gave a bit of a laugh, then, and said, â€˜Itâ€™s true what they said, thenâ€”youâ€™re blind entirely?â€™â€

She had stood up, facing the invisible visitor, recognizing the voice, but not quite knowing yet why.

â€œâ€˜So ye dinna ken me, Mrs. Cameron? I was a friend to your husbandâ€”though itâ€™s been a good many years since last we met. On the coast of Scotlandâ€”on a moonlicht nicht.â€™â€

She licked dry lips at the memory.

â€œSo then it came to me, all on the sudden. And I said, â€˜Blind I may be, but I ken ye well, sir. What dâ€™ye want?â€™ But he was gone. And the next instant, I heard Phaedre and Ulysses talking as they came toward the tent; heâ€™d seen them, and fled away. I asked them, but theyâ€™d been taâ€™en up wiâ€™ their arguing, and hadna seen him leave. I kept someone by me all the time, then, until we leftâ€”and he didna come near me again. Until now.â€

Jamie frowned and rubbed a knuckle slowly down the long, straight bridge of his nose.

â€œWhy did ye not tell me then?â€

A trace of humor touched her ravaged face, and she wrapped her fingers round her injured wrist.

â€œI thought I was imagining things.â€



PHAEDRE HAD FOUND the bottle of laudanum where Jocasta had dropped it, under her chair in the sitting room. Likewise, a trail of tiny blood spots that I had missed in my hurry. These disappeared before reaching the door, though; whatever wound Jocasta had inflicted on the intruder had been minor.

Duncan, summoned discreetly, had hurried in to comfort Jocastaâ€”only to be sent directly out again, with instructions to see to the guests; neither injury nor illness was going to mar such an occasion!

Ulysses met with a slightly more cordial reception. In fact, Jocasta sent for him. Peering into her room to check on her, I found him sitting by the bed, holding his mistressâ€™s hand, with such an expression of gentleness on his usually impassive face that I was quite moved by it, and stepped quietly back into the hall, not to disturb them. He saw me, though, and nodded.

They were talking in low voices, his head in its stiff white wig bending toward hers. He seemed to be arguing with her, in a most respectful fashion; she shook her head, and gave a small cry of pain. His hand tightened on hers, and I saw that he had taken off his white gloves; her hand lay long and frail, pallid in his powerful dark grasp.

She breathed deeply, steadying herself. Then she said something definite, squeezed his hand, and lay back. He rose, and stood for a moment beside the bed, looking down at her. Then he drew himself up, and taking his gloves from his pocket, came out into the hall.

â€œIf you will fetch your husband, Mrs. Fraser?â€ he said, low-voiced. â€œMy mistress wishes me to tell him something.â€



THE PARTY WAS STILL IN full swing, but had shifted to a lower, digestive sort of gear. People greeted Jamie or me as we followed Ulysses into the house, but no one stopped us.

He led us downstairs to his butlerâ€™s pantry, a tiny room that lay off the winter kitchen, its shelves crammed with silver ornaments, bottles of polish, vinegar, blacking, and bluing, a housewife with needles, pins, and threads, small tools for mending, and what looked like a substantial private stock of brandy, whisky, and assorted cordials.

He removed these from their shelf, and reaching back into the empty space where they had stood, pressed upon the wood of the wall with both white-gloved hands. Something clicked, and a small panel slid aside with a soft rasping sound.

He stood aside, silently inviting Jamie to look. Jamie raised one eyebrow and leaned forward, peering into the recess. It was dark and shadowy in the butlerâ€™s pantry, with only a dim light filtering in from the high basement windows that ran around the top of the kitchen walls.

â€œItâ€™s empty,â€ he said.

â€œYes, sir. It should not be.â€ Ulyssesâ€™s voice was low and respectful, but firm.

â€œWhat was there?â€ I asked, glancing out of the pantry to be sure we were not overheard. The kitchen looked as though a bomb had gone off in it, but only a scullion was there, a half-witted boy who was washing pots, singing softly to himself.

â€œPart of an ingot of gold,â€ Ulysses replied softly.

The French gold Hector Cameron had brought away from Scotland, ten thousand pounds in bullion, cast in ingots and marked with the royal fleur-de-lis, was the foundation of River Runâ€™s wealth. But it would not do, of course, for that fact to be known. First Hector, and then, after Hectorâ€™s death, Ulysses, had taken one of the gold bars and scraped bits of the soft yellow metal into a small, anonymous heap. This could then be taken to the river warehousesâ€”or for additional safety, sometimes as far as the coastal towns of Edenton, Wilmington, or New Bernâ€”and there carefully changed, in small amounts that would cause no comment, into cash or warehouse certificates, which could safely be used anywhere.

â€œThere was about half of the ingot left,â€ Ulysses said, nodding toward the cavity in the wall. â€œI found it gone a few months ago. Since then, of course, I have contrived a new hiding place.â€

Jamie looked into the empty cavity, then turned to Ulysses.

â€œThe rest?â€

â€œSafe enough, last time I checked, sir.â€ The bulk of the gold was concealed inside Hector Cameronâ€™s mausoleum, hidden in a coffin and guarded, presumably, by his spirit. One or two of the slaves besides Ulysses might know about it, but the very lively fear of ghosts was enough to keep everyone away. I remembered the line of salt spread on the ground in front of the mausoleum, and shivered a little, in spite of the stifling heat in the basement.

â€œI could not, of course, make shift to look today,â€ the butler added.

â€œNo, of course not. Duncan knows?â€ Jamie nodded toward the recess, and Ulysses nodded.

â€œThe thief might have been anyone. So many people come to this house. . . .â€ The butlerâ€™s massive shoulders moved in a small shrug. â€œBut now that this man from the sea has come againâ€”it puts a different face upon the matter, does it not, sir?â€

â€œAye, it does.â€ Jamie contemplated the matter for a moment, tapping two fingers softly against his leg.

â€œWell, then. Yeâ€™ll need to stay for a bit, Sassenach, will ye not? To look after my auntâ€™s eye?â€

I nodded. Provided no infection resulted from my crude intervention, there was little or nothing I could do for the eye itself. But it should be watched, kept clean and irrigated, until I could be sure it was healed.

â€œWeâ€™ll stay, then, for a bit,â€ he said, turning to Ulysses. â€œIâ€™ll send the Bugs back to the Ridge, to mind things and see to the haying. Weâ€™ll stay, and watch.â€



THE HOUSE WAS FULL of guests, but I slept in Jocastaâ€™s dressing room, so that I might keep an eye on her. The easing of pressure in her eye had relieved the excruciating pain, and she had fallen soundly asleep, her vital signs reassuring enough that I felt I could sleep, too.

Knowing I had a patient, though, I slept lightly, waking at intervals to tiptoe into her room. Duncan was sleeping on a pallet at the foot of her bed, dead to the world from the exhaustions of the day. I could hear his heavy breathing, as I lit a taper from the hearth and came to stand by the bed.

Jocasta was still soundly asleep, lying on her back, arms crossed gracefully over the coverlet and her head thrown back, sternly long-nosed and aristocratic as the tomb figures in the chapel of St. Denys. All she wanted was a crown, and a small dog of some kind crouched at her feet.

I smiled at the thought, thinking as I did how odd it was: Jamie slept in exactly that fashion, lying flat on his back, hands crossed, straight as an arrow. Brianna didnâ€™t; she was a wild sleeper, and had been from a child. Like me.

The thought gave me a small, unexpected feeling of pleasure. I knew I had given her some parts of me, of course, but she resembled Jamie so strongly, it was always something of a surprise to notice one.

I blew out the taper, but didnâ€™t at once return to bed. I had taken Phaedreâ€™s cot in the dressing room, but it was a hot, airless little space. The hot day and the consumption of alcohol had left me cotton-mouthed, with a vague headache; I picked up the carafe from Jocastaâ€™s bedside, but it was empty.

No need to relight the taper; one of the sconces in the hallway was still burning, and a dim glow outlined the door. I pushed it open quietly and looked out. The corridor was lined with bodiesâ€”servants sleeping by the doors of the bedroomsâ€”and the air throbbed gently with the snoring and heavy breathing of a great many people sunk in slumber of varying degrees.

At the end of the corridor, though, one pale figure stood upright, looking out through the tall casement window toward the river.

She must have heard me, but didnâ€™t turn around. I came to stand beside her, looking out. Phaedre was undressed to her shift, her hair free of its cloth and falling in a soft thick mass around her shoulders. Rare for a slave to have such hair, I thought; most women kept their hair very short under turban or headcloth, lacking both time and tools for dressing it. But Phaedre was a body servant; she would have some leisureâ€”and a comb, at least.

â€œWould you like your bed back?â€ I asked, low-voiced. â€œIâ€™ll be up for a whileâ€”and can sleep on the divan.â€

She glanced at me, and shook her head.

â€œOh, no, maâ€™am,â€ she said softly. â€œThankee kindly; I ainâ€™t sleepy.â€ She saw the carafe I carried, and reached for it. â€œI fetch you some water, maâ€™am?â€

â€œNo, no, Iâ€™ll do it. Iâ€™d like the air.â€ Still, I stood beside her, looking out.

It was a beautiful night, thick with stars that hung low and bright over the river, a faint silver thread that wound its way through the dark. There was a moon, a slender sickle, riding low on its way below the curve of the earth, and one or two small campfires burned in the trees beside the river.

The window was open, and bugs were swarming in; a small cloud of them danced around the candle in the sconce behind us, and tiny winged things brushed my face and arms. Crickets sang, so many of them that their song was a high, constant sound, like a bow drawn over violin strings.

Phaedre moved to shut itâ€”to sleep with a window open was considered most unhealthy, and likely was, given the various mosquito-borne diseases in this swampish atmosphere.

â€œI thought I heard something. Out there,â€ she said, nodding toward the dark below.

â€œOh? Probably my husband,â€ I said. â€œOr Ulysses.â€

â€œUlysses?â€ she said, looking startled.

Jamie, Ian, and Ulysses had organized a system of patrol, and were doubtless out somewhere in the night, gliding round the house and keeping an eye on Hectorâ€™s mausoleum, just in case. Knowing nothing of the disappearing gold nor Jocastaâ€™s mysterious visitor, though, Phaedre wouldnâ€™t be aware of the increased vigilance, save in the indirect way in which slaves always knew thingsâ€”the instinct that had doubtless roused her to look out the window.

â€œTheyâ€™re just keeping an eye out,â€ I said, as reassuringly as I could. â€œWith so many people here, you know.â€ The MacDonalds had gone to Farquard Campbellâ€™s plantation to spend the night, and a goodly number of guests had gone with them, but there were still a lot of people on the premises.

She nodded, but looked troubled.

â€œIt just feel like something ainâ€™t right,â€ she said. â€œDonâ€™t know what â€™tis.â€

â€œYour mistressâ€™s eyeâ€”â€ I began, but she shook her head.

â€œNo. No. I donâ€™t know, but there something in the air; I be feelinâ€™ it. Not just tonight, I donâ€™t meanâ€”something goinâ€™ on. Something coming.â€ She looked at me, helpless to express what she meant, but her mood communicated itself to me.

It might be in part simply the heightened emotions of the oncoming conflict. One could in fact feel that in the air. But there might be something else, tooâ€”something subterranean, barely sensed, but there, like the dim form of a sea serpent, glimpsed for only a moment, then gone, and so put down to legend.

â€œMy grannie, she taken from Africa,â€ Phaedre said softly, staring out at the night. â€œShe talk to the bones. Say they tell her when bad things cominâ€™.â€

â€œReally?â€ In such an atmosphere, quiet save the night sounds, so many souls adrift around us, there seemed nothing unreal about such a statement. â€œDid she teach you to . . . talk to bones?â€

She shook her head, but the corner of her mouth tucked in, a small, secret expression, and I thought she might know more about it than she was willing to say.

One unwelcome thought had occurred to me. I didnâ€™t see how Stephen Bonnet could be connected to present eventsâ€”surely he was not the man who had spoken to Jocasta out of her past, and just as surely, stealthy theft was not his style. But he did have some reason to believe there might be gold somewhere at River Runâ€”and from what Roger had told us of Phaedreâ€™s encounter with the big Irishman in Cross Creek . . .

â€œThe Irishman you met, when you were out with Jemmy,â€ I said, changing my grip on the slick surface of the carafe, â€œhave you ever seen him again?â€

She looked surprised at that; clearly Bonnet was the farthest thing from her mind.

â€œNo, maâ€™am,â€ she said. â€œAinâ€™t seen him again, ever.â€ She thought for a moment, big eyes hooded. She was the color of strong coffee with a dash of cream, and her hairâ€”there had been a white man in her family tree at some time, I thought.

â€œNo, maâ€™am,â€ she repeated softly, and turned her troubled gaze back to the quiet night and the sinking moon. â€œAll I knowâ€”something ainâ€™t right.â€

Out by the stables, a rooster began to crow, the sound out of place and eerie in the dark.

WENDIGO




August 20, 1774

THE LIGHT IN THE MORNING room was perfect.

â€œWe began with this room,â€ Jocasta had told her great-niece, raising her face to the sun that poured through the open double doors to the terrace, lids closed over her blind eyes. â€œI wanted a room to paint in, and chose this spot, where the light would come in, bright as crystal in the morning, like still water in the afternoon. And then we built the house around it.â€ The old womanâ€™s hands, still long-fingered and strong, touched the easel, the pigment pots, the brushes, with affectionate regret, as she might caress the statue of a long-dead loverâ€”a passion recalled, but accepted as forever gone.

And Brianna, sketching block and pencil in hand, had drawn as quickly, as covertly as she could, to catch that fleeting expression of grief outlived.

That sketch lay with the others in the bottom of her box, against the day when she might try it in more finished form, try to catch that merciless light, and the deep-carved lines of her auntâ€™s face, strong bones stark in the sun she could not see.

For now, though, the painting at hand was a matter of business, rather than love or art. Nothing suspicious had happened since Flora MacDonaldâ€™s barbecue, but her parents meant to stay for a little longer, just in case. With Roger still in Charlotteâ€”he had written to her; the letter was secreted in the bottom of her box, with the private sketchesâ€”there was no reason why she shouldnâ€™t stay, too. Hearing of her continued presence, two or three of Jocastaâ€™s acquaintances, wealthy planters, had commissioned portraits of themselves or their families; a welcome source of income.

â€œI will never understand how ye do that,â€ Ian said, shaking his head at the canvas on her easel. â€œItâ€™s wonderful.â€

In all honesty, she didnâ€™t understand how she did it, either; it didnâ€™t seem necessary. Sheâ€™d said as much in answer to similar compliments before, though, and realized that such an answer generally struck the hearer either as false modesty or as condescension.

She smiled at him, instead, letting the glow of pleasure she felt show in her face.

â€œWhen I was little, my father would take me walking on the Common, and weâ€™d see an old man there often, painting with an easel. I used to make Daddy stop so I could watch, and he and the old man would chat. I mostly just stared, but once I got up the nerve to ask him how he did that and he looked down at me and smiled, and said, â€˜The only trick, sweetie, is to see what youâ€™re looking at.â€™â€

Ian looked from her to the picture, then back, as though comparing the portrait with the hand that had made it.

â€œYour father,â€ he said, interested. He lowered his voice, glancing toward the door into the hallway. There were voices, but not close. â€œYe dinna mean Uncle Jamie?â€

â€œNo.â€ She felt the familiar small ache at the thought of her first father, but put it aside. She didnâ€™t mind telling Ian about himâ€”but not here, with slaves all over the place and a constant flow of visitors who might pop in at any moment.

â€œLook.â€ She glanced over her shoulder to be sure no one was near, but the slaves were talking loudly in the foyer, arguing over a misplaced boot scraper. She lifted the cover of the small compartment that held spare brushes, and reached under the strip of felt that lined it.

â€œWhat do you think?â€ She held the pair of miniatures out for his inspection, one in either palm.

The look of expectation on his face changed to outright fascination, and he reached slowly for one of the tiny paintings.

â€œI will be damned,â€ he said. It was the one of her mother, her hair long and curling loose on bare shoulders, the small firm chin raised with an authority that belied the generous curve of the mouth above.

â€œThe eyesâ€”I donâ€™t think those are quite right,â€ she said, peering into his hand. â€œWorking so small . . . I couldnâ€™t get the color, exactly. Daâ€™s were much easier.â€

Blues just were easier. A tiny dab of cobalt, highlighted with white and that faint green shadow that intensified the blue while vanishing itself . . . well, and that was Da, too. Strong, vivid, and straightforward.

To get a brown with true depth and subtlety, though, let alone something that even approximated the smoky topaz of her motherâ€™s eyesâ€”always clear, but changing like the light on a peat-brown trout streamâ€”that needed more underpainting than was really possible in the tiny space of a miniature. Sheâ€™d have to try again sometime, with a larger portrait.

â€œAre they like, do you think?â€

â€œTheyâ€™re wonderful.â€ Ian looked from one to the other, then he put the portrait of Claire gently back into its place. â€œHave your parents seen them yet?â€

â€œNo. I wanted to be sure they were right, before I showed them to anybody. But if they areâ€”Iâ€™m thinking I can show them to the people who come to sit, and maybe get commissions for more miniatures. Those I could work on at home, on the Ridge; all Iâ€™d need is my paint box and the little ivory discs. I could do the painting from the sketches; I wouldnâ€™t need the sitter to keep coming.â€

She made a brief, explanatory gesture toward the large canvas she was working on, which showed Farquard Campbell, looking rather like a stuffed ferret in his best suit, surrounded by numerous children and grandchildren, most of these mere whitish blobs at the moment. Her strategy was to have their mothers drag the small ones in one at a time, to have each childâ€™s limbs and features hastily sketched into the appropriate blob before natural wriggliness or tantrums obtruded.

Ian glanced at the canvas, but his attention returned to the miniatures of her parents. He stood looking at them, a slight smile on his long, half-homely face. Then, feeling her eyes on him, he glanced up, alarmed.

â€œOh, no, ye donâ€™t!â€

â€œOh, come on, Ian, let me just sketch you,â€ she coaxed. â€œIt wonâ€™t hurt, you know.â€

â€œOch, thatâ€™s what you think,â€ he countered, backing away as though the pencil she had taken up might be a weapon. â€œThe Kahnyenâ€™kehaka think to have a likeness of someone gives ye power over them. Thatâ€™s why the medicine society wear false facesâ€”so the demons causing the illness willna have their true likeness and willna ken who to hurt, aye?â€

This was said in such a serious tone that she squinted at him, to see whether he was joking. He didnâ€™t seem to be.

â€œMmm. Ianâ€”Mama explained to you about germs, didnâ€™t she?â€

â€œAye, she did, oâ€™ course,â€ he said, in a tone exhibiting no conviction at all. â€œShe showed me things swimminâ€™ about, and said they were livinâ€™ in my teeth!â€ His face showed momentary repugnance at the notion, but he left the matter to return to the subject at hand.

â€œThere was a traveling Frenchman came to the village once, a natural philosopherâ€”heâ€™d drawings heâ€™d made of birds and animals, and that astonished themâ€”but then he made the mistake of offering to make a likeness of the war chiefâ€™s wife. I barely got him out in one piece.â€

â€œBut you arenâ€™t a Mohawk,â€ she said patiently, â€œand if you wereâ€”youâ€™re not afraid of me having power over you, are you?â€

He turned his head and gave her a sudden queer look that went through her like a knife through butter.

â€œNo,â€ he said. â€œNo, of course not.â€ But his voice had little more conviction than when discussing germs.

Still, he moved to the stool she kept for sitters, set in good light from the open doors that led to the terrace, and sat down, chin lifted and jaw set like one about to be heroically executed.

Suppressing a smile, she took up the sketching block and drew as quickly as she could, lest he change his mind. He was a difficult subject; his features lacked the solid, clear-cut bone structure that both her parents and Roger had. And yet it was in no way a soft face, even discounting the stippled tattoos that curved from the bridge of his nose across his cheeks.

Young and fresh, and yet the firmness of his mouthâ€”it was slightly crooked, she saw with interest; how had she never noticed that before?â€”belonged to someone much older, bracketed by lines that would cut much deeper with age, but were already firmly entrenched.

The eyes . . . she despaired of getting those right. Large and hazel, they were his one claim to beauty, and yet, beautiful was the last thing you would call them. Like most eyes, they werenâ€™t one color at all, but manyâ€”the colors of autumn, dark wet earth and crackling oak leaves, and the touch of setting sun on dry grass.

The color was a challenge, but one she could meet. The expression, thoughâ€”it changed in an instant from something so guilelessly amiable as to seem almost half-witted to something you wouldnâ€™t want to meet in a dark alley.

The expression at present was somewhere between these two extremes, but shifted suddenly toward the latter as his attention focused on the open doors behind her, and the terrace beyond.

She glanced over her shoulder, startled. Someone was there; she saw the edge of hisâ€”or herâ€”shadow, but the person who threw it was keeping out of sight. Whoever it was began to whistle, a tentative, breathy sound.

For an instant, everything was normal. Then the world shifted. The intruder was whistling â€œYellow Submarine.â€

All the blood rushed from her head, and she swayed, grabbing the edge of an occasional table to keep from falling. Dimly, she sensed Ian rising like a cat from his stool, seizing one of her palette knives, and sliding noiselessly out of the room into the hallway.

Her hands had gone cold and numb; so had her lips. She tried to whistle a phrase in reply, but nothing but a little air emerged. Straightening up, she took hold of herself, and sang the last few words instead. She could barely manage the tune, but there was no doubt of the words.

Dead silence from the terrace; the whistling had stopped.

â€œWho are you?â€ she said clearly. â€œCome in.â€

The shadow lengthened slowly, showing a head like a lionâ€™s, light shining through the curls, glowing on the terrace stones. The head itself poked cautiously into sight around the corner of the door. It was an Indian, she saw, with astonishment, though his dress was mostly Europeanâ€”and raggedâ€”bar a wampum necklet. He was lean and dirty, with close-set eyes, which were fixed on her with eagerness and something like avidity.

â€œYou alone, man?â€ he asked, in a hoarse whisper. â€œThought I heard voices.â€

â€œYou can see I am. Who on earth are you?â€

â€œAh . . . Wendigo. Wendigo Donner. Your nameâ€™s Fraser, right?â€ He had edged all the way into the room now, though still glancing warily from side to side.

â€œMy maiden name, yes. Are youâ€”â€ She stopped, not sure how to ask.

â€œYeah,â€ he said softly, looking her up and down in a casual way that no man of the eighteenth century would have employed to a lady. â€œSo are you, arenâ€™t you? Youâ€™re her daughter, you have to be.â€ He spoke with a certain intensity, moving closer.

She didnâ€™t think he meant her harm; he was just very interested. Ian didnâ€™t wait to see, though; there was a brief darkening of the light from the door, and then he had Donner from behind, the Indianâ€™s squawk of alarm choked off by the arm across his throat, the point of the palette knife jabbing him under the ear.

â€œWho are ye, arsebite, and what dâ€™ye want?â€ Ian demanded, tightening the arm across Donnerâ€™s throat. The Indianâ€™s eyes bulged, and he made small mewling noises.

â€œHow do you expect him to answer you, if youâ€™re choking him?â€ This appeal to reason caused Ian to relax his grip, albeit reluctantly. Donner coughed, rubbing his throat ostentatiously, and shot Ian a resentful look.

â€œNo need for that, man, I wasnâ€™t doinâ€™ nothinâ€™ to her.â€ Donnerâ€™s eyes went from her to Ian and back. He jerked his head toward Ian. â€œIs he . . . ?â€

â€œNo, but he knows. Sit down. You met my mother when sheâ€”when she was kidnapped, didnâ€™t you?â€

Ianâ€™s feathery brows shot up at this, and he took a firmer grip on the palette knife, which was flexible but had a definite point.

â€œYeah.â€ Donner lowered himself gingerly onto the stool, keeping a wary eye on Ian. â€œMan, they nearly got me. Your mother, she told me her old man was gnarly and I didnâ€™t want to be there when he showed up, but I didnâ€™t believe her. Almost, I didnâ€™t. But when I heard those drums, man, I bugged out, and a damn good thing I did, too.â€ He swallowed, looking pale. â€œI went back, in the morning. Jeez, man.â€

Ian said something under his breath, in what Brianna thought was Mohawk. It sounded unfriendly in the extreme, and Donner evidently discerned enough of the meaning to make him scoot his stool a little farther away, hunching his shoulders.

â€œHey, man, I didnâ€™t do nothinâ€™ to her, okay?â€ He looked pleadingly at Brianna. â€œI didnâ€™t! I was gonna help her get awayâ€”ask her, sheâ€™ll tell you! Only Fraser and his guys showed up before I could. Christ, why would I hurt her? Sheâ€™s the first one I found back hereâ€”I needed her!â€

â€œThe first one?â€ Ian said, frowning. â€œThe firstâ€”â€

â€œThe first . . . traveler, he means,â€ Brianna said. Her heart was beating fast. â€œWhat did you need her for?â€

â€œTo tell me how to getâ€”back.â€ He swallowed again, his hand going to the wampum ornament around his neck. â€œYouâ€”did you come through, or were you born here? Iâ€™m figuring you came through,â€ he added, not waiting for an answer. â€œThey donâ€™t grow â€™em as big as you now. Little bitty girls. Me, I like a big woman.â€ He smiled, in what he plainly intended to be an ingratiating manner.

â€œI came,â€ Brianna said shortly. â€œWhat the hell are you doing here?â€

â€œTrying to get close enough to talk to your mother.â€ He glanced uneasily over his shoulder; there were slaves in the kitchen garden, their voices audible. â€œI hid out with the Cherokee for a while, then I figured to come down and talk to her at Fraserâ€™s Ridge when it was safe, but the old lady there told me you were all down here. Heck of a long way to walk,â€ he added, looking vaguely resentful.

â€œBut then that big black dude ran me off twice, when I tried to get in before. Guess I didnâ€™t meet the dress code.â€ His face flickered, not quite managing a smile.

â€œI been sneaking around for the last three days, trying to catch a glimpse of her, find her alone outside. But I saw her talking to you, out on the terrace, and heard you call her Mama. Seeing how big you are, I figured you must be . . . well, I figured if you didnâ€™t pick up on the song, no harm done, huh?â€

â€œSo ye want to go back where ye came from, do ye?â€ Ian asked. Plainly he thought this was an excellent idea.

â€œOh, yeah,â€ Donner said fervently. â€œOh, yeah!â€

â€œWhere did you come through?â€ Brianna asked. The shock of his appearance was fading, subsumed by curiosity. â€œIn Scotland?â€

â€œNo, is that where you did it?â€ he asked eagerly. Scarcely waiting for her nod, he went on. â€œYour mother said she came and then went back and came again. Can you-all go back and forth, like, you know, a revolving door?â€

Brianna shook her head violently, shuddering in recollection.

â€œGod, no. Itâ€™s horrible, and itâ€™s so dangerous, even with a gemstone.â€

â€œGemstone?â€ He pounced on that. â€œYou gotta have a gemstone to do it?â€

â€œNot absolutely, but it seems to be some protection. And it may be that thereâ€™s some way to use gemstones toâ€”to steer, sort of, but we donâ€™t really know about that.â€ She hesitated, wanting to ask more questions, but wanting still more to fetch Claire. â€œIanâ€”could you go get Mama? I think sheâ€™s in the kitchen garden with Phaedre.â€

Her cousin gave the visitor a flat, narrow look, and shook his head.

â€œIâ€™ll not leave ye alone wiâ€™ this fellow. You go; Iâ€™ll watch him.â€

She would have argued, but long experience with Scottish males had taught her to recognize intractable stubbornness when she saw it. Besides, Donnerâ€™s eyes were fixed on her in a way that made her slightly uncomfortableâ€”he was looking at her hand, she realized, at the cabochon ruby in her ring. She was reasonably sure she could fight him off, if necessary, but still . . .

â€œIâ€™ll be right back,â€ she said, hastily stabbing a neglected brush into the pot of turps. â€œDonâ€™t go anywhere!â€



I WAS SHOCKED, but less so than I might have been. I had felt that Donner was alive. Hoped he was, in spite of everything. Still, seeing him face to face, sitting in Jocastaâ€™s morning room, struck me dumb. He was talking when I came in, but stopped when he saw me. He didnâ€™t stand up, naturally, nor yet offer any observations on my survival; just nodded at me, and resumed what heâ€™d been saying.

â€œTo stop whitey. Save our lands, save our people.â€

â€œBut you came to the wrong time,â€ Brianna pointed out. â€œYou were too late.â€

Donner gave her a blank look.

â€œNo, I didnâ€™tâ€”1766, thatâ€™s when I was supposed to come, and thatâ€™s when I came.â€ He pounded the heel of his hand violently against the side of his head. â€œCrap! What was wrong with me?â€

â€œCongenital stupidity?â€ I suggested politely, having regained my voice. â€œThat, or hallucinogenic drugs.â€

The blank look flickered a little, and Donnerâ€™s mouth twitched.

â€œOh. Yeah, man. There was some of that.â€

â€œBut if you came to 1766â€”and meant toâ€â€”Bree objectedâ€”â€œwhat about Robert Springerâ€”Otter-Tooth? According to the story Mama heard about him, he meant to warn the native tribes against white men and prevent them colonizing the place. Only he arrived too late to do thatâ€”and even so, he must have arrived forty or fifty years before you did!â€

â€œThat wasnâ€™t the plan, man!â€ Donner burst out. He stood up, rubbing both hands violently through his hair in agitation, making it stand out like a bramble bush. â€œJeez, no!â€

â€œOh, it wasnâ€™t? What the bloody hell was the plan, then?â€ I demanded. â€œYou did have one.â€

â€œYeah. Yeah, we did.â€ He dropped his hands, glancing round as though fearing to be overheard. He licked his lips.

â€œBob did want to do what you saidâ€”only the rest said, nah, that wouldnâ€™t work. Too many different groups, too much pressure to trade with the whiteys . . . just no way it would fly, you know? We couldnâ€™t stop it all, just maybe make it better.â€

The official plan of the group had been somewhat less ambitious in scope. The travelers would arrive in the 1760s, and over the course of the next ten years, in the confusion and reshuffling, the movement of tribes and villages attendant upon the end of the French and Indian War, would infiltrate themselves into various Indian groups along the Treaty Line in the Colonies and up into the Canadian territories.

They would then use such persuasive powers as they had gained to sway the Indian nations to fight on the British side in the oncoming Revolution, with the intent of insuring a British victory.

â€œSee, the English, they act like the Indians are sovereign nations,â€ he explained, with a glibness suggesting this was a theory learned by rote. â€œThey won, theyâ€™d go on doing trade and like that, which is okay, but they wouldnâ€™t be trying to push the Indians back and stomp â€™em out. The colonistsâ€â€”he waved scornfully toward the open doorâ€”â€œgreedy sons oâ€™ bitches been shoving their way into Indian lands for the last hundred years; they ainâ€™t going to stop.â€

Bree raised her brows, but I could see that she found the notion intriguing. Evidently, it wasnâ€™t quite as insane as it sounded.

â€œHow could you think youâ€™d succeed?â€ I demanded. â€œOnly a few men toâ€”oh, my God,â€ I said, seeing his face change. â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christâ€”you werenâ€™t the only ones, were you?â€

Donner shook his head, wordless.

â€œHow many?â€ Ian asked. He sounded calm, but I could see that his hands were clenched on his knees.

â€œI dunno.â€ Donner sat down abruptly, slumping into himself like a bag of grain. â€œThere were like, two or three hundred in the group. But most of â€™em couldnâ€™t hear the stones.â€ His head lifted a little, and he glanced at Brianna. â€œCan you?â€

She nodded, ruddy brows drawn together.

â€œBut you think there were more . . . travelers . . . than you and your friends?â€

Donner shrugged, helpless.

â€œI got the idea there were, yeah. But Raymond said only five at a time could pass through. So we trained in, like, cells of five. We kept it secret; nobody in the big group knew who could travel and who couldnâ€™t, and Raymond was the only one who knew all of â€™em.â€

I had to ask.

â€œWhat did Raymond look like?â€ A possibility had been stirring in the back of my mind, ever since Iâ€™d heard that name.

Donner blinked, having not expected that question.

â€œJeez, I dunno,â€ he said helplessly â€œShort dude, I think. White hair. Wore it long, like we all did.â€ He raked a hand through his knotted locks in illustration, brows furrowed in the search for memory.

â€œA rather . . . wide . . . forehead?â€ I knew I oughtnâ€™t to prompt him, but couldnâ€™t help myself, and drew both index fingers across my own brow in illustration.

He stared at me in confusion for a moment.

â€œMan, I donâ€™t remember,â€ he said, shaking his head helplessly. â€œIt was a long time ago. How would I remember something like that?â€

I sighed.

â€œWell, tell me what happened, when you came through the stones.â€

Donner licked his lips, blinking in the effort of recall. It wasnâ€™t just native stupidity, I saw; he didnâ€™t like thinking about it.

â€œYeah. Well, there were five of us, like I said. Me, and Rob, and Jeremy and Atta. Oh, and Jojo. We came through on the island, andâ€”â€

â€œWhat island?â€ Brianna, Ian, and I all chorused together.

â€œOcracoke,â€ he said, looking surprised. â€œItâ€™s the northmost portal in the Bermuda Triangle group. We wanted to be as close as we could get toâ€”â€

â€œThe Berâ€”â€ Brianna and I began, but broke off, looking at each other.

â€œYou know where a number of these portals are?â€ I said, striving for calm.

â€œHow many are there?â€ Brianna chimed in, not waiting for his answer.

The answer, in any event, was confusedâ€”no surprise there. Raymond had told them that there were many such places in the world, but that they tended to occur in groups. There was such a group in the Caribbean, another in the Northeast, near the Canadian border. Another in the Southwestern desertâ€”Arizona, he thought, and down through Mexico. Northern Britain and the coast of France, as far as the tip of the Iberian peninsula. Probably more, but thatâ€™s all heâ€™d mentioned.

Not all of the portals were marked with stone circles, though those in places where people had lived for a long time tended to be.

â€œRaymond said those were safer,â€ he said, shrugging. â€œI dunno why.â€

The spot on Ocracoke hadnâ€™t been bounded by a full circle of stones, though it was marked. Four stones, he said. One of them had marks on it Raymond said were Africanâ€”maybe made by slaves.

â€œItâ€™s kind of in the water,â€ he said, shrugging. â€œA little stream runs through it, I mean. Ray said he didnâ€™t know about water, whether that made any difference, but he thought it might. But we didnâ€™t know what kind of difference. You guys know?â€

Brianna and I shook our heads, round-eyed as a pair of owls. Ianâ€™s brow, already furrowed, drew further down at this, though. Had he heard something, during his time with Geillis Duncan?

The five of themâ€”and Raymondâ€”had driven as far as they could; the road that led down the Outer Banks was a poor one, which tended to wash away in storms, and they were obliged to leave the car several miles away from the spot, struggling through the scrub pines of the coastal forest and patches of unexpected quicksand. It was late fallâ€”

â€œSamhain,â€ Brianna said softly, but softly enough that Donner was not distracted from the flow of his story.

Late fall, he said, and the weather was bad. It had been raining for days, and the footing was uncertain, slippery and boggy by turns. The wind was high, and the storm surge pounded the beaches; they could hear it, even in the secluded spot where the portal lay.

â€œWe were all scaredâ€”maybe all but Robâ€”but it was way exciting, man,â€ he said, beginning to show a glimmer of enthusiasm. â€œThe trees were just about layinâ€™ down flat, and the sky, it was green. The wind was so bad, you could taste salt, all the time, because little bits of ocean were flying through the air, mixed with the rain. We were, like, soaked through to our choners.â€

â€œYour what?â€ Ian said, frowning.

â€œUnderpantsâ€”you know, drawers. Smallclothes,â€ Brianna said, flapping an impatient hand. â€œGo on.â€

Once arrived at the place, Raymond had checked them all, to see that they carried the few necessities they might needâ€”tinderboxes, tobacco, a little money of the timeâ€”and then given each one a wampum necklet, and a small leather pouch, which he said was an amulet of ceremonial herbs.

â€œOh, you know about that,â€ he said, seeing the expression on my face. â€œWhat kind did you use?â€

â€œI didnâ€™t,â€ I said, not wanting him to wander from his story. â€œGo on. How did you plan to hit the right time?â€

â€œOh. Well.â€ He sighed, hunching on his stool. â€œWe didnâ€™t. Ray said it would be just about two hundred years, give or take a couple. It wasnâ€™t like we could steerâ€”thatâ€™s what I was hoping you guys would know. How to get to a specific time. â€™Cuz, boy, Iâ€™d sure like to go back and get there before I got messed up with Ray and them.â€

They had, at Raymondâ€™s direction, walked a pattern among the stones, chanting words. Donner had no idea what the words meant, nor even what the language was. At the conclusion of the pattern, though, they had walked single file toward the stone with African markings, passing carefully to the left of it.

â€œAnd, likeâ€”pow!â€ He smacked a fist into the palm of his other hand. â€œFirst guy in lineâ€”heâ€™s gone, man! We were just freaked out. I mean, thatâ€™s what was sâ€™posed to happen, but . . . gone,â€ he repeated, shaking his head. â€œJust . . . gone.â€

Agog at this evidence of effectiveness, they had repeated the pattern and the chant, and at each repetition, the first man to pass the stone had vanished. Donner had been the fourth.

â€œOh, God,â€ he said, going pale at the memory. â€œOh, God, I never felt anything like that before and I hope I never do again.â€

â€œThe amuletâ€”the pouch you had,â€ Brianna said, ignoring his pallor. Her own face was intense, blazing with interest. â€œWhat happened to that?â€

â€œI dunno. I maybe dropped it, maybe it went someplace else. I passed out, and when I came to, it wasnâ€™t with me.â€ The day was warm and close, but he began to shiver. â€œJojo. He was with me. Only he was dead.â€

That statement struck me like a knife blow, just under the ribs. Geillis Duncanâ€™s notebooks had held lists of people found near stone circlesâ€”some alive, some dead. I hadnâ€™t needed anything to tell me that the journey through the stones was a perilous passageâ€”but this reminder made me feel weak in the knees, and I sat down on Jocastaâ€™s tufted ottoman.

â€œThe others,â€ I said, trying to keep my voice steady. â€œDid they . . .â€

He shook his head. He was still clammy and shivering, but sweat glazed his face; he looked very unwell.

â€œNever saw â€™em again,â€ he said.

He didnâ€™t know what had killed Jojo; didnâ€™t pause to look, though he had a vague notion that there might have been burn marks on his shirt. Finding his friend dead, and none of the others nearby, he had stumbled off in a panic through scrub forest and salt marsh, collapsing after several hours of wandering, lying in the sand dunes among stiff grass all night. He had starved for three days, found and eaten a nest of turtle eggs, eventually made his way to the mainland on a stolen canoe, and thereafter had drifted haplessly, working here and there at menial jobs, seeking refuge in drink when he could afford it, falling into company with Hodgepile and his gang a year or so past.

The wampum necklets, he said, were to allow the conspirators to identify each other should they meet at some pointâ€”but he had never seen anybody else wearing one.

Brianna wasnâ€™t paying attention to this rambling part of the story, though; she had jumped ahead.

â€œDo you think Otter-Toothâ€”Springerâ€”screwed up your group by deliberately trying to go to a different time?â€

He looked at her, mouth hanging open a little.

â€œI never thoughta that. He went first. He went first,â€ he repeated, in a wondering sort of way.

Brianna began to ask another question, but was interrupted by the sound of voices in the hall, coming toward the morning room. Donner was on his feet in an instant, eyes wide with alarm.

â€œCrap,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s him. You gotta help me!â€

Before I could inquire exactly why he thought so, or who â€œhimâ€ was, the austere form of Ulysses appeared in the doorway.

â€œYou,â€ he said to the cowering Donner, in awful tones. â€œDid I not tell you to begone, sirrah? How dare you to enter Mrs. Innesâ€™s house and pester her relations?â€

He stepped aside, then, with a nod to whomever stood beside him, and a small, round, cross-looking gentleman in a rumpled suit peered in.

â€œThatâ€™s him,â€ he said, pointing an accusatory finger. â€œThatâ€™s the blackguard what stole my purse at Jacobsâ€™s ordinary this morning! Took it right out my pocket whilst I was eatinâ€™ ham for breakfast!â€

â€œIt wasnâ€™t me!â€ Donner made a poor attempt at a show of outrage, but guilt was written all over his face, and when Ulysses seized him by the scruff of the neck and unceremoniously rummaged his clothing, the purse was discovered, to the outspoken gratification of the owner.

â€œThief!â€ he cried, shaking his fist. â€œI been a-following of you all the morning. Damnâ€™ tick-bellied, louse-ridden, dog-eatinâ€™ savageâ€”oh, I do beg pardon, ladies,â€ he added, bowing to me and Brianna as an afterthought before resuming his denunciation of Donner.

Brianna glanced at me, eyebrows raised, but I shrugged. There was no way of preserving Donner from the righteous wrath of his victim, even had I really wanted to. At the gentlemanâ€™s behest, Ulysses summoned a pair of grooms and a set of manaclesâ€”the sight of which made Brianna grow somewhat paleâ€”and Donner was marched off, protesting that he hadnâ€™t done it, heâ€™d been framed, wasnâ€™t him, he was a friend of the ladies, really, man, ask â€™em! . . . to be conveyed to the gaol in Cross Creek.

There was a deep silence in the wake of his removal. At last, Ian shook his head as though trying to rid himself of flies, and putting down the palette knife at last, picked up the sketching block, where Brianna had made Donner try to draw the pattern he said the men had walked. A hopeless scrawl of circles and squiggles, it looked like one of Jemmyâ€™s drawings.

â€œWhat kind of name is Weddigo?â€ Ian asked, putting it down.

Brianna had been clutching her pencil so tightly that her knuckles were white. She unfolded her hand and put it down, and I saw that her hands were shaking slightly.

â€œWendigo,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s an Ojibway cannibal spirit that lives in the wood. It howls in storms and eats people.â€

Ian gave her a long look.

â€œNice fellow,â€ he said.

â€œWasnâ€™t he, just.â€ I felt more than a little shaken myself. Apart from the shock of Donnerâ€™s appearance and revelations, and then his arrest, small jolts of memoryâ€”vivid images of my first meeting with himâ€”kept shooting uncontrollably through my mind, despite my efforts to shut them out. I could taste blood in my mouth, and the stink of unwashed men drowned the scent of flowers from the terrace.

â€œI suppose itâ€™s what one would call a nom de guerre,â€ I said, with an attempt at nonchalance. â€œHe canâ€™t have been christened that, surely.â€

â€œAre you all right, Mama?â€ Bree was frowning at me. â€œShall I get something? A glass of water?â€

â€œWhisky,â€ Ian and I said in unison, and I laughed, despite the shakiness. By the time it arrived, I was in command of myself again.

â€œWhat do you think will happen to him, Ulysses?â€ I asked, as he held the tray for me. The butlerâ€™s stolidly handsome face showed nothing beyond a mild distaste for the recent visitor; I saw him frown at the scumbled bits of dirt that Donnerâ€™s shoes had left on the parquet floor.

â€œI suppose they will hang him,â€ he said. â€œMr. Townsendâ€”that was the gentlemanâ€™s nameâ€”had ten pound in the purse he stole.â€ More than enough to merit hanging. The eighteenth century took a dim view of thievery; as little as a pound could incur a capital sentence.

â€œGood,â€ said Ian, with obvious approval.

I felt a small lurch of the stomach. I disliked Donner, distrusted him, and to be honest, really didnâ€™t feel that his death would be a great loss to humanity, by and large. But he was a fellow traveler; did that impose any obligation on our part to help him? More importantly, perhapsâ€”did he have any more information that he hadnâ€™t told us yet?

â€œMr. Townsend has gone to Campbelton,â€ the butler added, offering the tray to Ian. â€œTo ask Mr. Farquard to attend to the case promptly, as he is bound for Halifax, and wishes to give his witness at once.â€ Farquard Campbell was a justice of the peaceâ€”and likely the only thing approaching a judge within the county, since the Circuit Court had ceased to operate.

â€œThey wonâ€™t hang him before tomorrow, though, I donâ€™t suppose,â€ Brianna said. She didnâ€™t normally drink whisky, but had taken a glass now; the encounter had shaken her, too. I saw she had turned the ring around upon her finger, rubbing the big ruby absentmindedly with her thumb.

â€œNo,â€ said Ian, looking at her suspiciously. â€œYe dinna mean toâ€”â€ He glanced at me. â€œNo!â€ he said in horror at the indecision he saw on my face. â€œYon fellowâ€™s a thief and a blackguard, and if ye didna see him burning and killing wiâ€™ your own eyes, Auntie, ye ken well enough he did it. For Godâ€™s sake, let them hang him and have done!â€

â€œWell . . .â€ I said, wavering. The sound of footsteps and voices in the hall saved me answering. Jamie and Duncan had been in Cross Creek; now they were back. I felt an overwhelming flood of relief at sight of Jamie, who loomed up in the doorway, sunburned and ruddy, dusty from riding.

â€œHang who?â€ he inquired cheerfully.



JAMIEâ€™S OPINION WAS the same as Ianâ€™s; let them hang Donner, and good riddance. He was reluctantly persuaded that either Brianna or I must talk to the man at least once more, though, to be sure there was nothing further he could tell us.

â€œIâ€™ll speak to the gaoler,â€ he said without enthusiasm. â€œMind, thoughâ€â€”he pointed a monitory finger at meâ€”â€œneither of ye is to go anywhere near the man, save Ian or I am with ye.â€

â€œWhat do you think heâ€™d do?â€ Brianna was ruffled, annoyed at his tone. â€œHeâ€™s about half my size, for heavenâ€™s sake!â€

â€œAnd a rattlesnake is smaller yet,â€ her father replied. â€œYe wouldna walk into a room with one of those, only because ye outweigh him, I hope?â€

Ian snickered at that, and Brianna gave him an elbow, hard in the ribs.

â€œAnyway,â€ Jamie said, ignoring them, â€œIâ€™ve a bit of news. And a letter from Roger Mac,â€ he said. He pulled it out of his shirt, smiling at Bree. â€œIf yeâ€™re no too distracted to read it?â€

She lit up like a candle and grabbed it. Ian made a teasing snatch at it, and she slapped his hand away, laughing, and ran out of the room to read it in privacy.

â€œWhat sort of news?â€ I asked. Ulysses had left the tray and decanter; I poured a tot into my empty glass and gave it to Jamie.

â€œSomeoneâ€™s seen Manfred McGillivray,â€ he replied. â€œSlÃ inte.â€ He drained the glass, looking contented.

â€œOh, aye? Where?â€ Ian looked less than pleased at this news. For myself, I was thrilled.

â€œIn a brothel, where else?â€

Unfortunately, his informant had not been able to supply the exact location of said brothelâ€”having likely been too drunk at the time to know precisely where he was, as Jamie cynically observedâ€”but had been reasonably sure that it was in Cross Creek or Campbelton. Also unfortunately, the sighting was several weeks old. Manfred might well have moved on.

â€œItâ€™s a start, though,â€ I said, hopeful. Penicillin was effective, even against more advanced cases of syphilis, and I had some brewing in the winter kitchen, even now. â€œIâ€™ll go with you, when you go to the gaol. Then after weâ€™ve spoken with Donner, we can go look for the brothel.â€

Jamieâ€™s look of contentment lessened appreciably.

â€œWhat? Why?â€

â€œI dinna think Manfred would be still there, Auntie,â€ Ian said, patently amused. â€œI doubt heâ€™d have the money, for one thing.â€

â€œOh, ha ha,â€ I said. â€œHe might have said where he was staying, mightnâ€™t he? Besides, I want to know whether he was showing any symptoms.â€ In my own time, it might be ten, twenty, or even thirty years after the appearance of the initial chancre before further syphilitic symptoms developed; in this time, though, syphilis was a much more fulminant diseaseâ€”a victim could die within a year of infection. And Manfred had been gone for more than three months; God knew how long since he had first contracted the infection.

Jamie looked distinctly unenthused about the idea of searching for brothels; Ian seemed rather more interested.

â€œIâ€™ll help look,â€ he volunteered. â€œFergus can come, too; he kens a great deal about whoresâ€”theyâ€™d likely talk to him.â€

â€œFergus? Fergus is here?â€

â€œHe is,â€ Jamie said. â€œThat was the other bit of news. Heâ€™s payinâ€™ his respects to my aunt at the moment.â€

â€œWhy is he here, though?â€

â€œWell, ye heard the talk at the barbecue, aye? About Mr. Simms, the printer, and his troubles? It seems theyâ€™ve got worse, and he thinks of selling up, before someone burns his shop to the ground and him in it. It struck me that perhaps it would suit Fergus and Marsali, better than the farming. So I sent word for him to come down, and maybe have a word wiâ€™ Simms.â€

â€œThatâ€™s a brilliant idea!â€ I said. â€œOnly . . . what would Fergus use for money to buy it?â€

Jamie coughed and looked evasive.

â€œAye, well. I imagine some sort of bargain might be struck. Particularly if Simms is anxious to sell up.â€

â€œAll right,â€ I said, resigned. â€œI donâ€™t suppose I want to know the gory details. But Ianâ€”â€ I turned to him, fixing him with a beady eye. â€œFar be it from me to offer you moral advice. But you are notâ€”repeat, notâ€”to be questioning whores in any deeply personal manner. Do I make myself clear?â€

â€œAuntie!â€ he said, pretending shock. â€œThe idea!â€ But a broad grin spread across his tattooed face.

TAR AND FEATHERS




IN THE EVENT, I let Jamie go alone to the gaol to make arrangements for seeing Donner. He had assured me that this would be simpler without my presence, and I had several errands in Cross Creek. Besides the usual salt, sugar, pins, and other household goods needing replenishment, I urgently needed more cinchona bark for Lizzie. The gallberry ointment worked to treat malarial attacks, but was not nearly so effective as Jesuit bark in preventing them.

The British trade restrictions were having their effect, though. There was, of course, no tea to be foundâ€”I had expected that; there had been none for nearly a yearâ€”but neither was there any sugar, save at an exorbitant price, and steel pins were not to be found at all.

Salt, I could get. With a pound of this in my basket, I made my way up from the docks. The day was hot and humid; away from the slight breeze off the river, the air was motionless and thick as treacle. The salt had solidified in its burlap bags, and the merchant had had to chip off lumps of it with a chisel.

I wondered how Ian and Fergus were coming with their researches; I had a scheme in mind regarding the brothel and its inhabitants, but first, we had to find it.

I hadnâ€™t mentioned the idea to Jamie. If anything came of it, that would be time enough. A side street offered shade, in the form of a number of large elms that had been planted so as to overhang the street. I stepped into the welcome shadow of one of these, and found myself at the edge of the fashionable districtâ€”about ten houses, all toldâ€”of Cross Creek. From where I stood, I could see Dr. Fentimanâ€™s fairly modest abode, distinguished by a small hanging shingle decorated with a caduceus. The doctor was not in when I called, but his servant, a neat, plain young woman with badly crossed eyes, admitted me and showed me to the consulting room.

This was a surprisingly cool and pleasant room, with large windows and a worn canvas cloth on the floor, painted in blue and yellow chequers, and furnished with a desk, two comfortable chairs, and a chaise longue on which patients might recline for examination. He had a microscope standing on the desk, through which I peered with interest. It was a fine one, though not quite so good as my own, I thought with some complacency.

I was possessed of a strong curiosity about the rest of his equipment, and was debating with myself as to whether it would be an abuse of the doctorâ€™s hospitality to snoop through his cupboards, when the doctor himself arrived, borne on the wings of brandywine.

He was humming a little tune to himself, and carrying his hat under one arm, his battered medical case in the crook of the other. Seeing me, he dropped these carelessly on the floor and hastened to grasp me by the hand, beaming. He bowed over my hand and pressed moistly fervent lips to my knuckles.

â€œMrs. Fraser! My dear lady, I am so pleased to see you! You are in no physical distress, I trust?â€

I was in some danger of being overwhelmed by the fumes of alcohol on his breath, but kept as cordial a countenance as possible, unobtrusively wiping my hand upon my gown, whilst assuring him that I was entirely well, as were all the members of my immediate family.

â€œOh, splendid, splendid,â€ he said, plumping down quite suddenly upon a stool and giving me an enormous grin, revealing tobacco-stained molars. His oversize wig had slid round sideways, causing him to peer out from under it like a dormouse under a tea cozy, but he seemed not to have noticed. â€œSplendid, splendid, splendid.â€

I took his rather vague wave as invitation and sat down, as well. I had brought a small present in order to sweeten the good doctor, and now removed this from my basketâ€”though in all truth, I rather thought he was so well-marinated as to require little more attention before I broached the subject of my errand.

He was, however, thrilled with my giftâ€”a gouged-out eyeball, which Young Ian had thoughtfully picked up for me following a fight in Yanceyville, hastily preserved in spirits of wine. Having heard something of Doctor Fentimanâ€™s tastes, I thought he might appreciate it. He did, and went on saying, â€œSplendid!â€ at some length.

Eventually trailing off, he blinked, held the jar up to the light, and turned it round, viewing it with great admiration.

â€œSplendid,â€ he said once more. â€œIt will have a most particularly honorable place in my collection, I do assure you, Mrs. Fraser!â€

â€œYou have a collection?â€ I said, affecting great interest. Iâ€™d heard about his collection.

â€œOh, yes, oh, yes! Would you care to see it?â€

There was no possibility of refusal; he was already up and staggering toward a door at the back of his study. This proved to lead into a large closet, the shelves of which held thirty or forty glass containers, filled with alcoholic spiritsâ€”and a number of objects which could indeed be described as â€œinteresting.â€

These ranged from the merely grotesque to the truly startling. One by one, he brought out a big toe sporting a wart the size and color of an edible mushroom, a preserved tongue which had been splitâ€”apparently during the ownerâ€™s lifetime, as the two halves were quite healedâ€”a cat with six legs, a grossly malformed brain (â€œRemoved from a hanged murderer,â€ as he proudly informed me. â€œI shouldnâ€™t wonder,â€ I murmured in reply, thinking of Donner and wondering what his brain might look like), and several infants, presumably stillborn, and exhibiting assorted atrocious deformities.

â€œNow, this,â€ he said, lifting down a large glass cylinder in trembling hands, â€œis quite the prize of my collection. There is a most distinguished physician in Germany, a Herr Doktor Blumenbach, who has a world-renowned collection of skulls, and he has been pursuing meâ€”nay, absolutely pestering me, I assure you!â€”in an effort to persuade me to part with it.â€

â€œThisâ€ was the defleshed skulls and spinal column of a double-headed infant. It was, in fact, fascinating. It was also something that would cause any woman of childbearing age to swear off sex immediately.

Grisly as the doctorâ€™s collection was, though, it offered me an excellent opportunity for approaching my true errand.

â€œThat is truly amazing,â€ I said, leaning forward as though to examine the empty orbits of the floating skulls. They were separate and complete, I saw; it was the spinal cord that had divided, so that the skulls hung side by side in the fluid, ghostly white and leaning toward each other so that the rounded heads touched gently, as though sharing some secret, only separating when a movement of the jar caused them momentarily to float apart. â€œI wonder what causes such a phenomenon?â€

â€œOh, doubtless some dreadful shock to the mother,â€ Doctor Fentiman assured me. â€œWomen in an expectant condition are fearfully vulnerable to any sort of excitement or distress, you know. They must be kept quite sequestered and confined, well away from any injurious influences.â€

â€œI daresay,â€ I murmured. â€œBut you know, some malformationsâ€”that one, for instance?â€”I believe are the result of syphilis in the mother.â€

It was; I recognized the typical malformed jaw, the narrow skull, and the caved-in appearance of the nose. This child had been preserved with flesh intact, and lay curled placidly in its bottle. By the size and lack of hair, it had likely been premature; I hoped for its own sake that it had not been born alive.

â€œShiphiâ€”syphilis,â€ the doctor repeated, swaying a little. â€œOh, yes. Yes, yes. I got that particular little creature from a, um . . .â€ It occurred to him belatedly that syphilis was perhaps not a topic suitable to discuss with a lady. Murdererâ€™s brains and two-headed children, yes, but not venereal disease. There was a jar in the closet that I was reasonably sure contained the scrotum of a Negro male who had suffered from elephantiasis; I noticed he hadnâ€™t shown me that one.

â€œFrom a prostitute?â€ I inquired sympathetically. â€œYes, I suppose such misfortunes must be common among such women.â€

To my annoyance, he slithered away from the desired topic.

â€œNo, no. In factâ€”â€ He darted a look over his shoulder, as though fearing to be overheard, then leaned near me and whispered hoarsely, â€œI received that specimen from a colleague in London, some years ago. It is reputed to be the child of a foreign nobleman!â€

â€œOh, dear,â€ I said, taken aback. â€œHow . . . interesting.â€

At this rather inconvenient point, the servant came in with teaâ€”or rather, with a revolting concoction of roasted acorns and chamomile, stewed in waterâ€”and the conversation turned ineluctably toward social trivia. I was afraid that the tea might sober him up before I could inveigle him back in the right direction, but luckily the tea tray also included a decanter of fine claret, which I dispensed liberally.

I had a fresh try at drawing him back into medical subjects, by leaning over to admire the jars left out on his desk. The one nearest me contained the hand of a person who had had such an advanced case of Dupuytrenâ€™s contracture as to render the appendage little more than a knot of constricted fingers. I wished Tom Christie could see it. He had avoided me since his surgery, but so far as I knew, his hand was still functional.

â€œIsnâ€™t it remarkable, the variety of conditions that the human body displays?â€ I said.

He shook his head. He had discovered the state of his wig and turned it round; his wizened countenance beneath it looked like that of a solemn chimpanzeeâ€”bar the flush of broken capillaries that lit his nose like a beacon.

â€œRemarkable,â€ he echoed. â€œAnd yet, what is quite as remarkable is the resilience a body may show in the face of quite terrible injury.â€

That was true, but it wasnâ€™t at all the line I wished to work upon.

â€œYes, quite. Butâ€”â€

â€œI am very sorry not to be able to show you one specimenâ€”it would have been a notable addition to my collection, I assure you! But alas, the gentleman insisted upon taking it with him.â€

â€œHeâ€”what?â€ Well, after all, I had in my time presented various children with their appendixes or tonsils in a bottle, following surgery. I supposed it wasnâ€™t entirely unreasonable for someone to wish to retain an amputated limb.

â€œYes, most astonishing.â€ He took a meditative sip of claret. â€œA testicle, it wasâ€”I trust you will pardon my mentioning it,â€ he added belatedly. He hesitated for an instant, but in the end, simply couldnâ€™t resist describing the occurrence. â€œThe gentleman had suffered a wound to the scrotum, a most unfortunate accident.â€

â€œMost,â€ I said, feeling a sudden tingle at the base of my spine. Was this Jocastaâ€™s mysterious visitor? I had been keeping off the claret, in the interests of a clear head, but now poured a tot, feeling it needed. â€œDid he say how this unfortunate incident transpired?â€

â€œOh, yes. A hunting accident, he said. But they all say that, donâ€™t they?â€ He twinkled at me, the end of his nose bright red. â€œI expect it was a duello. The work of a jealous rival, perhaps!â€

â€œPerhaps.â€ A duello? I thought. But most duels of the time were fought with pistols, not swords. It really was good claret, and I felt a little steadier. â€œYouâ€”erâ€”removed the testicle?â€ He must have, if he had been contemplating adding it to his ghastly collection.

â€œYes,â€ he said, and was not too far gone to give a small sympathetic shudder at the memory. â€œThe gun-shot had been seriously neglected; he said it had occurred some days previous. I was obliged to remove the injured testicle, but fortunately preserved the other.â€

â€œIâ€™m sure he was pleased about that.â€ Gun-shot? Surely not, I was thinking. It canâ€™t be . . . and yet . . . â€œDid this happen quite recently?â€

â€œMmm, no.â€ He tilted back in his chair, eyes crossing slightly with the effort of recall. â€œIt was in the spring, two years agoâ€”May? Perhaps May.â€

â€œWas the gentleman named Bonnet, by chance?â€ I was surprised that my voice sounded quite casual. â€œI believe I had heard that a Stephen Bonnet was involved in some such . . . accident.â€

â€œWell, you know, he would not give his name. Often patients will not, if the injury is one that might cause public embarrassment. I do not insist in such cases.â€

â€œBut you do remember him.â€ I found that I was sitting on the edge of my chair, claret cup clenched in my fist. With a little effort, I set it down.

â€œMm-hmm.â€ Damn, he was getting sleepy; I could see his lids begin to droop. â€œA tall gentleman, well-dressed. He had a . . . a most beautiful horse. . . .â€

â€œA bit more tea, Doctor Fentiman?â€ I urged a fresh cup upon him, willing him to stay awake. â€œDo tell me more about it. The surgery must have been quite delicate?â€

In fact, men never like to hear that the removal of testicles is a simple matter, but it is. Though I would admit that the fact of the patientâ€™s being conscious during the whole procedure had likely added to the difficulty.

Fentiman regained a bit of his animation, telling me about it.

â€œ. . . and the ball had gone straight through the testicle; it had left the most perfect hole. . . . You could look quite through it, I assure you.â€ Plainly he regretted the loss of this interesting specimen, and it was with some difficulty that I got him to tell me what had become of the gentleman to whom it belonged.

â€œWell, that was odd. It was the horse, you see . . .â€ he said vaguely. â€œLovely animal . . . long hair, like a womanâ€™s, so unusual . . .â€

A Friesian horse. The doctor had recalled that the planter Phillip Wylie was fond of such horses, and had said as much to his patient, suggesting that as the man had no moneyâ€”and would not be capable of riding comfortably for some time, in any caseâ€”he might think of selling his animal to Wylie. The man had agreed to this, and had requested the doctor to make inquiry of Wylie, who was in town for the Court Sessions.

Doctor Fentiman had obligingly gone out to do so, leaving his patient cozily tucked up on the chaise with a draught of tincture of laudanum.

Phillip Wylie had professed himself most interested in the horse (â€œYes, Iâ€™ll wager he was,â€ I said, but the doctor didnâ€™t notice), and had hastened round to see it. The horse was present, but the patient was not, having absconded on foot in the doctorâ€™s absenceâ€”taking with him half a dozen silver spoons, an enameled snuffbox, the bottle of laudanum, and six shillings, which happened to be all the money the doctor had in the house.

â€œI cannot imagine how he managed it,â€ Fentiman said, eyes quite round at the thought. â€œIn such condition!â€ To his credit, he appeared more distressed at the notion of his patientâ€™s condition than his own loss. He was a terrible drunkard, Fentiman, I thought; Iâ€™d never seen him completely soberâ€”but not a bad doctor.

â€œStill,â€ he added philosophically, â€œallâ€™s well as ends well, is it not, my dear lady?â€

By which he meant that Phillip Wylie had purchased the horse from him for a price sufficient to more than compensate for his losses, and leave him with a tidy profit.

â€œQuite,â€ I said, wondering just how Jamie would take this news. He had won the stallionâ€”for it must of course be Lucasâ€”from Phillip Wylie in the course of an acrimonious card game at River Run, only to have the horse stolen by Stephen Bonnet a few hours later.

On the whole, I expected that Jamie would be pleased that the stallion was back in good hands, even if they werenâ€™t his. As for the news about Bonnet . . . â€œA bad penny always turns up,â€ had been his cynical opinion, expressed when Bonnetâ€™s body had failed to be discovered after Brianna had shot him.

Fentiman was openly yawning by now. He blinked, eyes watering, patted about his person in search of a handkerchief, then bent to rummage in his case, which he had dropped on the floor near his chair.

I had pulled out my own handkerchief and leaned across to hand it to him, when I saw them in the open case.

â€œWhat are those?â€ I asked, pointing. I could see what they were, of course; what I wanted to know was where heâ€™d got them. They were syringes, two of them, lovely little syringes, made of brass. Each one was composed of two bits: a plunger with curled handles, and a cylindrical barrel, drawn out at the narrowed end into a very long, blunt-tipped needle.

â€œIâ€”whyâ€”that is . . . ah . . .â€ He was terribly taken aback, and stammered like a schoolboy caught sneaking cigarettes behind the toilets. Then something occurred to him, and he relaxed.

â€œEars,â€ he declared, in ringing tones. â€œFor cleansing ears. Yes, that is what they are, indubitably. Ear clysters!â€

â€œOh, are they really?â€ I picked one up; he tried to stop me, but his reflexes were delayed, and he succeeded only in grabbing at the ruffle of my sleeve.

â€œHow ingenious,â€ I said, working the plunger. It was a little stiff, but not bad at allâ€”particularly not when the alternative was a makeshift hypodermic composed of a leather tube with a rattlesnakeâ€™s fang attached. Of course a blunt tip wouldnâ€™t do, but it would be a simple matter to cut it to a sharp angle. â€œWhere did you get them? I should like very much to order one myself.â€

He stared at me in abject horror, jaw agape.

â€œIâ€”erâ€”I really do not think . . .â€ he protested feebly. Just then, in a perfect miracle of bad timing, his housemaid appeared in the doorway.

â€œMr. Brennanâ€™s come; itâ€™s his wifeâ€™s time,â€ she said briefly.

â€œOh!â€ Doctor Fentiman leapt to his feet, slammed shut his case, and snatched it up.

â€œMy apologies, dear Mrs. Fraser . . . must go . . . matter of great urgencyâ€”so pleasant to have seen you!â€ He rushed out, case clutched to his bosom, stepping on his hat in his haste.

The maid picked up the crushed chapeau with an air of resignation, and punched it indifferently back into shape.

â€œWill you be wanting to leave now, maâ€™am?â€ she inquired, with an intonation making it clear that I ought to be leaving, whether I wanted to or not.

â€œI will,â€ I said, rising. â€œBut tell meâ€â€”I held out the brass syringe on the palm of my handâ€”â€œdo you know what this is, and where Doctor Fentiman got it?â€

It was difficult to tell in which direction she was looking, but she bent her head as though to examine it, with no more interest than had it been a two-day old smelt offered her for sale in the market.

â€œOh, that. Aye, maâ€™am, itâ€™s a penis syringe. I bâ€™lieve he had it sent him from Philadelphia.â€

â€œA, um, penis syringe. I see,â€ I said, blinking a little.

â€œYes, maâ€™am. Itâ€™s for treating of the drip, or the clap. The doctor does a deal of business for the men what goes to Mrs. Silvieâ€™s.â€

I took a deep breath.

â€œMrs. Silvieâ€™s. Ah. And would you know where Mrs. Silvieâ€™s . . . establishment is?â€

â€œBehind Silas Jamesonâ€™s ordinary,â€ she replied, giving me for the first time a faintly curious look, as though wondering what sort of blockhead didnâ€™t know that. â€œWill you be needing anything else, maâ€™am?â€

â€œOh, no,â€ I said. â€œThat will do nicely, thank you!â€ I made to hand her back the penis syringe, but then was struck by impulse. The doctor had two, after all.

â€œGive you a shilling for it,â€ I said, meeting the eye that seemed most likely to be pointed in my direction.

â€œDone,â€ she said promptly. She paused for a moment, then added, â€œIf youâ€™re going to use it on your man, best be sure heâ€™s dead drunk first.â€



MY PRIMARY MISSION was thus accomplished, but now I had a new possibility to explore, before mounting an assault on Mrs. Silvieâ€™s house of ill-repute.

I had planned to visit a glassmaker and attempt to explain by means of drawings how to make the barrel and plunger for a hypodermic syringe, leaving up to Bree the problem of making a hollow needle and attaching it. Unfortunately, while the single glassblower operating in Cross Creek was capable of producing any manner of everyday bottles, jugs, and cups, a glance at his stock had made it obvious that my requirements were well beyond his capabilities.

But now I neednâ€™t worry about that! While metal syringes lacked some desirable qualities of glass, they also had an undeniable advantage, insofar as they wouldnâ€™t breakâ€”and while a disposable needle was nice, I could simply sterilize the entire item after each use.

Doctor Fentimanâ€™s syringes had very thick, blunt-tipped needle ends. It would be necessary to heat them, and draw the tips out much further in order to narrow them. But any idiot with a forge could do that, I thought. Then to cut the brass tip at an angle and file the point smooth enough to puncture skin cleanly . . . childâ€™s play, I thought blithely, and narrowly refrained from skipping down the sandy walk. Now, all I required was a good stock of cinchona bark.

My hopes of obtaining the bark were dashed, though, as soon as I turned into the main street and glimpsed Mr. Boguesâ€™s apothecaryâ€™s shop. The door stood open, letting in flies, and the usually immaculate stoop was marred with such a multitude of muddy footprints as to suggest that some hostile army had descended upon the shop.

The impression of sacking and looting was furthered by the scene inside; most of the shelves were empty, scattered with remnants of dried leaf and broken pottery. The Boguesesâ€™ ten-year-old daughter, Miranda, stood mournful watch over a small collection of jars and bottles and an empty tortoiseshell.

â€œMiranda!â€ I said. â€œWhatever has happened?â€

She brightened at sight of me, small pink mouth momentarily reversing its downward droop.

â€œMrs. Fraser! Dâ€™you want some horehound? Weâ€™ve nearly a pound of that leftâ€”and itâ€™s cheap, only three farthings the ounce.â€

â€œIâ€™ll have an ounce,â€ I said, though in fact I had plenty growing in my own garden. â€œWhere are your parents?â€

The mouth went down again, and the lower lip quivered.

â€œMamaâ€™s in the back, packing. And Papaâ€™s gone to sell Jack to Mr. Raintree.â€

Jack was the apothecaryâ€™s wagon horse, and Mirandaâ€™s particular pet. I bit the inside of my lip.

â€œMr. Raintreeâ€™s a very kind man,â€ I said, striving for what comfort there might be. â€œAnd he has a nice pasture for his horses, and a warm stable; I think Jack might be happy there. Heâ€™ll have friends.â€

She nodded, mouth pinched tight, but two fat tears escaped to roll down her cheeks.

With a quick glance behind me, to assure that no one was coming in, I stepped round the counter, sat down on an upturned keg, and drew her onto my lap, where she melted at once, clinging to me and crying, though making an obvious effort not to be heard in the living quarters behind the shop.

I patted her and made small soothing noises, feeling an unease beyond mere sympathy for the girl. Clearly the Bogueses were selling up. Why?

So infrequently as I came down the mountain, I had no idea what Ralston Boguesâ€™s politics might be these days. Not being Scottish, he hadnâ€™t come to the barbecue in Flora MacDonaldâ€™s honor. The shop had always been prosperous, though, and the family decently off, judging by the childrenâ€™s clothesâ€”Miranda and her two little brothers always had shoes. The Bogueses had lived here all of Mirandaâ€™s life, at least, and likely longer. For them to be leaving in this manner meant that something serious had happenedâ€”or was about to.

â€œDo you know where youâ€™re going?â€ I asked Miranda, who was now sitting on my knee, sniffing and wiping her face on my apron. â€œPerhaps Mr. Raintree can write to you, to tell you how Jack is faring.â€

She looked a little more hopeful at that.

â€œCan he send a letter to England, do you think? Itâ€™s a terrible long way.â€

England? It was serious.

â€œOh, I should think so,â€ I said, tucking wisps of hair back under her cap. â€œMr. Fraser writes a letter every night, to his sister in Scotlandâ€”and thatâ€™s much further away even than England!â€

â€œOh. Well.â€ Looking happier, she scrambled off my lap and smoothed down her dress. â€œCan I write to Jack, do you think?â€

â€œIâ€™m sure Mr. Raintree will read the letter to him if you do,â€ I assured her. â€œCan you write well, then?â€

â€œOh, yes, maâ€™am,â€ she said earnestly. â€œPapa says I read and write better than he ever did when he was my age. And in Latin. He taught me to read all the names of the simples, so I could fetch him what he wantedâ€”see that one?â€ She pointed with some pride to a large china apothecaryâ€™s jar, elegantly decorated with blue and gold scrolls. â€œElectuary Limonensis. And that one is Ipecacuanha!â€

I admired her prowess, thinking that at least I now knew her fatherâ€™s politics. The Bogueses must be Loyalists, if they were returning to England. I would be sorry to see them go, but knowing what I knew of the immediate future, I was glad that they would be safe. At least Ralston would likely have got a decent price for his shop; a short time hence, Loyalists would have their property confiscated, and be lucky to escape arrestâ€”or worse.

â€œRandy? Have you seen Georgieâ€™s shoe? Iâ€™ve found one under the chest, butâ€”oh, Mrs. Fraser! Your pardon, maâ€™am, I didnâ€™t know anyone was here.â€ Melanie Boguesâ€™s sharp glance took in my position behind the counter, her daughterâ€™s pink-rimmed eyes, and the damp spots on my apron, but she said nothing, merely patting Mirandaâ€™s shoulder as she passed.

â€œMiranda tells me youâ€™re leaving for England,â€ I said, rising and moving unobtrusively out from behind the counter. â€œWeâ€™ll be sorry to see you go.â€

â€œThatâ€™s kind of you, Mrs. Fraser.â€ She smiled unhappily. â€œWeâ€™re sorry to go, as well. And Iâ€™m not looking forward to the voyage, I can tell you!â€ She spoke with the heartfelt emotion of someone who had made such a voyage before and would strongly prefer to be boiled alive before doing it again.

I sympathized very much, having done it myself. Doing it with three children, two of them boys under five . . . the imagination boggled.

I wanted to ask her what had caused them to make such a drastic decision, but couldnâ€™t think how to broach the matter in front of Miranda. Something had happened; that was clear. Melanie was jumpy as a rabbit, and somewhat more harried than even packing up a household containing three children might account for. She kept darting glances over her shoulder, as though fearing something sneaking up on her.

â€œIs Mr. Boguesâ€”â€ I began, but was interrupted by a shadow falling across the stoop. Melanie started, hand to her chest, and I whirled round to see who had come.

The doorway was filled by a short, stocky woman, dressed in a very odd combination of garments. For an instant, I thought she was an Indian, for she wore no cap, and her dark hair was braidedâ€”but then she came into the shop, and I saw that she was white. Or rather, pink; her heavy face was flushed with sunburn and the tip of her pug nose was bright red.

â€œWhich one of you is Claire Fraser?â€ she demanded, looking from me to Melanie Bogues.

â€œI am,â€ I said, repressing an instinctive urge to take a step backward. Her manner wasnâ€™t threatening, but she radiated such an air of physical power that I found her rather intimidating. â€œWho are you?â€ I spoke from astonishment, rather than rudeness, and she did not seem offended.

â€œJezebel Hatfield Morton,â€ she said, squinting intently at me. â€œSome geezer at the docks tellt me that you was headinâ€™ here.â€ In marked contrast to Melanie Bogueâ€™s soft English accent, she had the rough speech I associated with people who had been in the backcountry for three or four generations, speaking to no one in the meantime save raccoons, possums, and one another.

â€œEr . . . yes,â€ I said, seeing no point in denying it. â€œDid you need help of some kind?â€

She didnâ€™t look it; had she been any healthier, she would have burst the seams of the manâ€™s shirt she was wearing. Melanie and Miranda were staring at her, wide-eyed. Whatever danger Melanie had been afraid of, it wasnâ€™t Miss Morton.

â€œNot to say help,â€ she said, moving further into the shop. She tilted her head to one side, examining me with what looked like fascination. â€œI was thinkinâ€™ you might know whereâ€™bouts that skunk Isaiah Morton be, though.â€

My mouth dropped open, and I shut it quickly. Not Miss Morton, thenâ€”Mrs. Morton. The first Mrs. Isaiah Morton, that is. Isaiah Morton had fought with Jamieâ€™s militia company in the War of the Regulation, and he had mentioned his first wifeâ€”breaking out in a cold sweat as he did so.

â€œI . . . ah . . . believe heâ€™s working somewhere upcountry,â€ I said. â€œGuilford? Or was it Paleyville?â€

Actually, it was Hillsboro, but that scarcely mattered, since at the moment, he wasnâ€™t in Hillsboro. He was, in fact, in Cross Creek, come to take delivery of a shipment of barrels for his employer, a brewster. Iâ€™d seen him at the cooperâ€™s shop barely an hour earlier, in company with the second Mrs. Morton and their infant daughter. Jezebel Hatfield Morton did not look like the sort of person to be civilized about such things.

She made a low noise in her throat, indicative of disgust.

â€œHeâ€™s a dang slippery little weasel. But Iâ€™ll kotch up to him yet, donâ€™t you trouble none about that.â€ She spoke with a casual assurance that boded ill for Isaiah.

I thought silence was the wiser course, but couldnâ€™t stop myself asking, â€œWhy do you want him?â€ Isaiah possessed a certain uncouth amiability, but viewed objectively, he scarcely seemed the sort to inflame one woman, let alone two.

â€œWant him?â€ She looked amused at the thought, and rubbed a solid fist under her reddened nose. â€œI donâ€™t want him. But ainâ€™t no man runs out on me for some whey-faced trollop. Once I kotch up to him, I mean to stave his head in and nail his fly-bit hide to my door.â€

Spoken by another person, this statement might have passed for rhetoric. As spoken by the lady in question, it was an unequivocal declaration of intent. Mirandaâ€™s eyes were round as a frogâ€™s, and her motherâ€™s nearly so.

Jezebel H. Morton squinted at me, and scratched thoughtfully beneath one massive breast, leaving the fabric of her shirt pasted damply to her flesh.

â€œI heerd tell as how you saved the little toad-suckerâ€™s life at Alamance. That true?â€

â€œEr . . . yes.â€ I eyed her warily, watching for any offensive movement. She was blocking the door; if she made for me, I would dive across the counter and dash through the door into the Boguesesâ€™ living quarters.

She was wearing a large pig-sticker of a knife, unsheathed. This was thrust through a knotted wampum belt that was doing double duty, holding up a kilted mass of what I thought might originally have been red flannel petticoats, hacked off at the knee. Her very solid legs were bare, as were her feet. She had a pistol and powder horn slung from the belt, as well, but made no move to reach for any of her weapons, thank God.

â€œToo bad,â€ she said dispassionately. â€œBut then, if heâ€™d died, Iâ€™d not have the fun of killinâ€™ him, so I sâ€™pose itâ€™s as well. Donâ€™t worry me none; ifâ€™n I donâ€™t find him, one of my brothers will.â€

Business apparently disposed of for the moment, she relaxed a bit, and looked around, noticing for the first time the empty shelves.

â€œWhat-allâ€™s goinâ€™ on here?â€ she demanded, looking interested.

â€œWeâ€™re selling up,â€ Melanie murmured, attempting to shove Miranda safely behind her. â€œGoing to England.â€

â€œThat so?â€ Jezebel looked mildly interested. â€œWhat happened? They kill your man? Or tar and feather him?â€

Melanie went white.

â€œNo,â€ she whispered. Her throat moved as she swallowed, and her frightened gaze went toward the door. So that was the threat. I felt suddenly cold, in spite of the sweltering heat.

â€œOh? Well, if you care whether they do, maybe you best move on down to Center Street,â€ she suggested helpfully. â€œTheyâ€™re fixinâ€™ to make roast chicken out of somebody, sure as God made little green apples. You can smell hot tar all over town, and theyâ€™s a boiling of folks cominâ€™ forth from the taverns.â€

Melanie and Miranda uttered twin shrieks, and ran for the door, shoving past the unflappable Jezebel. I was moving rapidly in the same direction, and narrowly avoided a collision, as Ralston Bogues stepped through the door, just in time to catch his hysterical wife.

â€œRandy, you go mind your brothers,â€ he said calmly. â€œBe still, Mellie, itâ€™s all right.â€

â€œTar,â€ she panted, clutching him. â€œShe saidâ€”she saidâ€”â€

â€œNot me,â€ he said, and I saw that his hair dripped and his face shone pale through its sweat. â€œTheyâ€™re not after me. Not yet. Itâ€™s the printer.â€

Gently, he disengaged his wifeâ€™s hands from his arm, and stepped round the counter, casting a brief glance of curiosity at Jezebel.

â€œTake the children, go to Fergusonâ€™s,â€ he said, and pulled a fowling piece from its hiding place beneath the counter. â€œIâ€™ll come so soon as I may.â€ He reached into a drawer for the powder horn and cartridge box.

â€œRalston!â€ Melanie spoke in a whisper, glancing after Mirandaâ€™s retreating back, but the entreaty was no less urgent for its lack of volume. â€œWhere are you going?â€

One side of his mouth twitched, but he didnâ€™t reply.

â€œGo to Fergusonâ€™s,â€ he repeated, eyes fixed on the cartridge in his hand.

â€œNo! No, donâ€™t go! Come with us, come with me!â€ She seized his arm, frantic.

He shook her off, and went doggedly about the business of loading the gun.

â€œGo, Mellie.â€

â€œI will not!â€ Urgent, she turned to me. â€œMrs. Fraser, tell him! Please, tell him itâ€™s a wasteâ€”a terrible waste! He mustnâ€™t go.â€

I opened my mouth, unsure what to say to either of them, but had no chance to decide.

â€œI donâ€™t imagine Mistress Fraser will think it a waste, Mellie,â€ Ralston Bogues said, eyes still on his hands. He slung the strap of the cartridge box over his shoulder and cocked the gun. â€œHer husband is holding them off right nowâ€”by himself.â€

He looked up at me then, nodded once, and was gone.



JEZEBEL WAS RIGHT: you could smell tar all over town. This was by no means unusual in the summertime, especially near the warehouse docks, but the hot thick reek now took on an atmosphere of threat, burning in my nostrils. Tarâ€”and fearâ€”aside, I was gasping from the effort to keep up with Ralston Bogues, who was not precisely running, but was moving as fast as it was possible to go without breaking into a lope.

Jezebel had been right about the people boiling out of taverns, too; the corner of Center Street was choked with an excited crowd. Mostly men, I saw, though there were a few women of the coarser type among them, fishwives and bond servants.

The apothecary hesitated when he saw them. A few faces turned toward him; one or two plucked at their neighborsâ€™ sleeves, pointingâ€”and with not very friendly expressions on their faces.

â€œGet away, Bogues!â€ one man yelled. â€œItâ€™s not your businessâ€”not yet!â€

Another stooped, picked up a stone, and hurled it. It clacked harmlessly on the wooden walk, a few feet short of Bogues, but it drew more attention. Bits of the crowd were beginning to turn, surging slowly in our direction.

â€œPapa!â€ said a small, breathless voice behind me. I turned to see Miranda, cap lost and pigtails unraveling down her back, her face the color of beetroot from running.

There wasnâ€™t time to think about it. I picked her up and swung her off her feet, toward her father. Taken off guard, he dropped the gun and caught her under the arms.

A man lunged forward, reaching for the gun, but I swooped down and got it first. I backed away from him, clutching it to my chest, daring him with my eyes.

I didnâ€™t know him, but he knew me; his eyes flicked over me, hesitating, then he glanced back over his shoulder. I could hear Jamieâ€™s voice, and a lot of others, all trying to shout each other down. The breath was still whistling in my chest; I couldnâ€™t make out any words. The tone of it was argument, though; confrontation, not bloodshed. The man wavered, glanced at me, awayâ€”then turned and shoved his way back into the gathering crowd.

Bogues had had the sense to keep hold of his daughter, who had her arms wrapped tightly round his neck, face buried in his shirt. He darted his eyes at me, and made a small gesture, as though to take back the gun. I shook my head and held it tighter. The stock was warm and slick in my hands.

â€œTake Miranda home,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™llâ€”do something.â€

It was loaded and primed. One shot. The best I could do with that was to create a momentary distractionâ€”but that might help.

I pushed my way through the crowd, the gun pointed carefully down not to spill the powder, half-hidden in my skirts. The smell of tar was suddenly much stronger. A cauldron of the stuff lay overturned in front of the printerâ€™s shop, a black sticky puddle smoking and reeking in the sun.

Glowing embers and blackened chunks of charcoal were scattered across the street, under everyoneâ€™s feet; a solid citizen whom I recognized as Mr. Townsend was kicking the bejesus out of a hastily built fire, thwarting the attempts of a couple of young men to rebuild it.

I looked for Jamie and found him precisely where Ralston Bogues had said he wasâ€”in front of the door to the printerâ€™s shop, clutching a tar-smeared broom and with the light of battle in his eye.

â€œThat your man?â€ Jezebel Morton had caught up, and was peering interestedly over my shoulder. â€œBig â€™un, ainâ€™t he?â€

Tar was spattered all over the front of the shopâ€”and Jamie. A large glob was stuck in his hair, and I could see the flesh of his arm reddened where a long string of hot tar had struck. Despite this, he was grinning. Two more tar-daubed brooms lay on the ground nearby, one brokenâ€”almost certainly over someoneâ€™s head. At least for the moment, he was having fun.

I didnâ€™t at once see the printer, Fogarty Simms. Then a frightened face showed briefly at the window, but ducked out of sight as a rock flung from the crowd crashed into the window frame, cracking the glass.

â€œCome out, Simms, you slinkinâ€™ coward!â€ bellowed a man nearby. â€œOr shall we smoke you out?â€

â€œSmoke him! Smoke him!â€ Enthusiastic shouts came from the crowd, and a young man near me bent, scrabbling after a burning brand scattered from the fire. I stamped viciously on his hand as he grasped it.

â€œJesus God!â€ He let go and fell to his knees, clutching his hand between his thighs, open-mouthed and gasping with pain. â€œOh, oh, Jesus!â€

I edged away, shouldering my way through the press. Could I get near enough to give Jamie the gun? Or would that make matters worse?

â€œGet away from the door, Fraser! Weâ€™ve no quarrel with you!â€

I recognized that cultivated voice; it was Neil Forbes, the lawyer. He wasnâ€™t dressed in his usual natty suiting, though; he wore rough homespun. So it wasnâ€™t an impromptu attackâ€”heâ€™d come prepared for dirty work.

â€œHey! You speak for yourself, Forbes! Iâ€™ve a quarrel with him!â€ That was a burly man in a butcherâ€™s apron, red-faced and indignant, sporting a swollen and empurpled eye. â€œLook what he did to me!â€ He waved a meaty hand at the eye, then at the front of his clothing, where a tar-clotted broom had quite evidently caught him square in the chest. He shook a massive fist at Jamie. â€œYouâ€™ll pay for this, Fraser!â€

â€œAye, but Iâ€™ll pay ye in the same coin, Buchan!â€ Jamie feinted, broom held like a lance. Buchan yelped and skittered backward, face comically alarmed, and the crowd burst into laughter.

â€œCome back, man! Ye want to play savage, yeâ€™ll need a bit more paint!â€ Buchan had turned to flee, but was blocked by the crowd. Jamie lunged with the broom, smudging him neatly on the seat of his breeches. Buchan leaped in panic at the jab, causing more laughter and hoots of derision as he shoved and stumbled out of range.

â€œThe rest of ye want to play savage, too, do ye?â€ Jamie shouted. He swiped his broom through the steaming puddle and swung it hard in a wide arc before him. Droplets of hot tar flew through the air, and men yelled and pushed to get out of the way, stepping on each other and knocking each other down.

I was shoved to one side and fetched up hard against a barrel standing in the street. I would have fallen, save for Jezebel, who caught me by the arm and hauled me up, with no apparent effort.

â€œYon fellerâ€™s right rumbustious,â€ she said with approval, eyes fixed on Jamie. â€œI could admire me a man like that!â€

â€œYes,â€ I said, nursing a bruised elbow. â€œSo could I. Sometimes.â€

Such sentiments appeared not to be universal.

â€œGive him up, Fraser, or wear feathers with him! Frigging Tories!â€

The shout came from behind me, and I turned to see that the speaker had come prepared; he clutched a feather pillow in one hand, the end of it already ripped open, so that down feathers flew in spurts with each gesture.

â€œTar and feather â€™em all!â€

I turned again at the shout from above, and looked up in time to see a young man fling wide the shutters in the upper story of the house on the other side of the street. He was trying to stuff a feather bed through the window but was being substantially impeded in this endeavor by the housewife whose property it was. This lady had leaped on his back and was beating him about the head with a spurtle, uttering shrieks of condemnation.

A young man near me started clucking like a chicken, flapping his elbowsâ€”to the intense amusement of his friends, who all began to do it, too, drowning out any attempts at reasonâ€”not that there was much of that.

A chant started up at the far side of the street.

â€œTory, Tory, Tory!â€

The tenor of the situation was changing, and not for the better. I half-lifted the fowling piece, unsure what to do, but knowing that I must do something. Another moment, and theyâ€™d rush him.

â€œGive me the gun, Auntie,â€ said a soft voice at my shoulder, and I whirled round to find Young Ian there, breathing hard. I gave it to him without the slightest hesitation.

â€œReste dâ€™retour!â€ Jamie shouted in French. â€œOui, le tout! Stay back, all of you!â€ He might have been shouting at the crowd, but he was looking at Ian.

What the devil did heâ€”then I caught sight of Fergus, elbowing viciously to keep his place near the front of the crowd. Young Ian, who had been about to raise the gun, hesitated, holding it close.

â€œHeâ€™s right, stay back!â€ I said urgently. â€œDonâ€™t fire, not yet.â€ I saw now that a hasty shot might do more harm than good. Look at Bobby Higgins and the Boston Massacre. I didnâ€™t want any massacres taking place in Cross Creekâ€”particularly not with Jamie at the center of them.

â€œI wonâ€™tâ€”but Iâ€™m no going to let them take him, either,â€ Ian muttered. â€œIf they go for himâ€”â€ He broke off, but his jaw was set, and I could smell the sharp scent of his sweat, even above the reek of tar.

A momentary distraction had intervened, thank God. Yells from above made half the crowd turn to see what was happening.

Another manâ€”evidently the householderâ€”had popped up in the window above, jerking the first man back and punching him. Then the struggling pair disappeared from view, and within a few seconds, the sounds of altercation ceased and the womanâ€™s shrieks died away, leaving the feather bed hanging in limp anticlimax, half in and half out of the window.

The chant of â€œTory Tory Tory!â€ had died out during the fascination with the conflict overhead, but was now starting up again, punctuated by bellows for the printer to come out and give himself up.

â€œCome out, Simms!â€ Forbes bellowed. I saw that he had equipped himself with a fresh broom, and was edging closer to the print shopâ€™s door. Jamie saw him, too, and I saw his mouth twist with derision.

Silas Jameson, the proprietor of a local ordinary, was behind Forbes, crouched like a wrestler, his broad face wreathed in a vicious grin.

â€œCome out, Simms!â€ he echoed. â€œWhat kind of man takes shelter beneath a Scotsmanâ€™s skirts, eh?â€

Jamesonâ€™s voice was loud enough that everyone heard that, and most laughedâ€”including Jamie.

â€œA wise one!â€ Jamie shouted back, and shook the end of his plaid at Jameson. â€œThis tartanâ€™s sheltered many a poor lad in its time!â€

â€œAnd many a lassie, too, Iâ€™ll wager!â€ shouted some ribald soul in the crowd.

â€œWhat, dâ€™ye think Iâ€™ve your wife under my plaid?â€ Jamie was breathing hard, shirt and hair pasted to him with sweat, but still grinning as he seized the hem of his kilt. â€œYe want to come and have a look for her, then?â€

â€œIs there room under there for me, too?â€ called one of the fishwives promptly.

Laughter rolled through the crowd. Fickle as any mob, their mood was changing back from threat to entertainment. I took a deep, trembling breath, feeling sweat roll down between my breasts. He was managing them, but he was walking a razorâ€™s edge.

If heâ€™d made up his mind to protect Simmsâ€”and he hadâ€”then no power on earth would make him give the printer up. If the mob wanted Simmsâ€”and they didâ€”theyâ€™d have to go through Jamie. And they would, I thought, any minute.

â€œCome out, Simms!â€ yelled a voice from the Scottish Lowlands. â€œYe canny be hidinâ€™ up Fraserâ€™s backside all day!â€

â€œBetter a printer up my arse than a lawyer!â€ Jamie shouted back, waving his broom at Forbes in illustration. â€œTheyâ€™re smaller, aye?â€

That made them roar; Forbes was a beefily substantial sort, while Fogarty Simms was a pinched starveling of a man. Forbes went very red in the face, and I saw sly looks being cast in his direction. Forbes was in his forties, never married, and there was talk . . .

â€œI wouldna have a lawyer up my backside at all,â€ Jamie was shouting happily, poking at Forbes with his broom. â€œHeâ€™d steal your shite and charge ye for a clyster!â€

Forbesâ€™s mouth opened, and his face went purple. He backed up a step, and seemed to be shouting back, but no one could hear his response, drowned as it was by the roar of laughter from the crowd.

â€œAnd then heâ€™d sell it back to ye for night soil!â€ Jamie bellowed, the instant he could be heard. Neatly reversing his broom, he jabbed Forbes in the belly with the handle.

The crowd whooped in glee, and Forbes, no kind of a fighter, lost his head and charged Jamie, his own broom held like a shovel. Jamie, who had quite obviously been waiting for some such injudicious move, stepped aside like a dancer, tripped Forbes, and smacked him across the shoulders with the tar-smeared broom, sending him sprawling into the cooling tar puddle, to the raucous delight of the whole street.

â€œHere, Auntie, hold this!â€ The fowling piece was thrust suddenly back into my hands.

â€œWhat?â€ Completely taken aback, I whirled round to see Ian moving fast behind the crowd, beckoning to Fergus. In seconds, unnoticed by the crowdâ€”whose attention was riveted on the fallen Forbesâ€”they had reached the house where the feather bed hung from the window.

Ian stooped and cupped his hands; as though they had rehearsed it for years, Fergus stepped into this improvised stirrup and launched himself upward, swiping at the feather bed with his hook. It caught; he dangled for a moment, grabbing frantically with his sound hand at the hook, to keep it from coming off.

Ian sprang upward and seized Fergus round the waist, yanking downward. Then the fabric of the bed gave way under their combined weight, Fergus and Ian tumbled to the ground, and a perfect cascade of goose feathers poured out on top of them, only to be caught at once by the thick, damp air and whirled up into a delirious snowstorm that filled the street and plastered the surprised mob with clumps of sticky down.

The air seemed filled with feathers; they were everywhere, tickling eyes and nose and throat, sticking to hair and clothes and lashes. I wiped a bit of down from a watering eye and stepped hastily back, away from the half-blind people staggering near me, yelling and bumping into one another.

I had been watching Fergus and Ian, but when the featherstorm struck, Iâ€”unlike everyone else in the streetâ€”looked back at the print shop, in time to see Jamie reach through the door, seize Fogarty Simms by the arm, and snatch him out of the shop like a winkle on a pin.

Jamie gave Simms a shove that sent him staggering, then whirled back to snatch up his broom and cover the printerâ€™s escape. Ralston Bogues, who had been lurking in the shadow of a tree, popped out, a club in his hand, and ran after Simms to protect him, glancing back and brandishing the club to discourage pursuers.

This action had not gone totally unnoticed; though most of the men were distracted, batting and clawing at the bewildering cloud of feathers that surrounded them, a few had seen what was going on, and raised a halloo, yelping like hounds as they tried to push through the crowd in pursuit of the fleeing printer.

If ever there was a moment . . . Iâ€™d shoot above their heads and theyâ€™d duck, giving Simms time to get away. I raised the gun with decision, reaching for the trigger.

The fowling piece was snatched from my grasp so deftly that I didnâ€™t realize for an instant that it was gone, but stood staring in disbelief at my empty hands. Then a bellow came from behind me, loud enough to stun everyone nearby into silence.

â€œIsaiah Morton! You gonna die, boy!â€

The fowling piece went off by my ear with a deafening bwoom! and a cloud of soot that blinded me. Choking and coughing, I scrubbed at my face with my apron, recovering sight in time to see the short, pudgy figure of Isaiah Morton a block away, running as fast as his legs would carry him. Jezebel Hatfield Morton was after him in an instant, ruthlessly flattening anyone in her way. She leapt nimbly over a besmeared and befeathered Forbes, who was still on his hands and knees, looking dazed, then pushed through the remnants of the mob and hared down the street, short flannel petticoats flying, moving at a surprising rate of speed for someone of her build. Morton careened round a corner and disappeared, implacable Fury close on his tail.

I felt a trifle dazed myself. My ears were still ringing, but I looked up at a touch on my arm.

Jamie was squinting down at me, one eye closed, as though unsure he was seeing what he thought he was seeing. He was saying something I couldnâ€™t make out, but the gestures he was making toward my faceâ€”coupled with a telltale twitching of the corner of his mouthâ€”made his probable meaning quite clear.

â€œHa,â€ I said coldly, my own voice sounding tinny and far off. I swiped at my face again with the apron. â€œYou should talk!â€

He looked like a piebald snowman, with black splotches of tar on his shirt, and clumps of white goose down clinging to his brows, his hair, and the stubble of his beard. He said something else, but I couldnâ€™t hear him clearly. I shook my head and twisted a finger in my ear, indicating temporary deafness.

He smiled, took me by the shoulders, and leaned his head forward until his forehead met mine with a small thunk! I could feel him trembling slightly, but wasnâ€™t sure whether it was laughter or exhaustion. Then he straightened up, kissed my forehead, and took me by the arm.

Neil Forbes sat in the middle of the street, legs splayed and careful hair disheveled. He was black with tar from the shoulder to the knee on one side. Heâ€™d lost a shoe, and helpful parties were trying to pick the feathers off him. Jamie led me in a wide circle round him, nodding pleasantly as we passed.

Forbes looked up, glowering, and said something muffled, heavy face twisting in dislike. On the whole, I thought it was just as well I couldnâ€™t hear him.



IAN AND FERGUS HAD gone off with the majority of the rioters, no doubt to commit mayhem elsewhere. Jamie and I retired to the Sycamore, an inn on River Street, to seek refreshment and make repairs. Jamieâ€™s hilarity gradually subsided as I picked tar and feathers off him, but was significantly quenched by hearing an account of my visit to Dr. Fentiman.

â€œYe do what with it?â€ Jamie had flinched slightly during my recounting of the tale of Stephen Bonnetâ€™s testicle. When I reached a description of the penis syringes, he crossed his legs involuntarily.

â€œWell, you work the needlelike bit down in, of course, and then flush a solution of something like mercuric chloride through the urethra, I suppose.â€

â€œThrough the, er . . .â€

â€œDo you want me to show you?â€ I inquired. â€œI left my basket at the Boguesesâ€™, but I can get it, andâ€”â€

â€œNo.â€ He leaned forward and planted his elbows firmly on his knees. â€œDâ€™ye suppose it burns much?â€

â€œI canâ€™t think itâ€™s at all pleasant.â€

He shuddered briefly.

â€œNo, I shouldna think so.â€

â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s really effective, either,â€ I added thoughtfully. â€œPity to go through something like that, and not be cured. Donâ€™t you think?â€

He was watching me with the apprehensive air of a man who has just realized that the suspicious-looking parcel sitting next to him is ticking.

â€œWhatâ€”â€ he began, and I hurried to finish.

â€œSo you wonâ€™t mind going round to Mrs. Sylvieâ€™s and making the arrangements for me to treat the girls, will you?â€

â€œWho is Mrs. Sylvie?â€ he asked suspiciously.

â€œThe owner of the local brothel,â€ I said, taking a deep breath. â€œDr. Fentimanâ€™s maid told me about her. Now, I realize that there might be more than one brothel in town, but I think that Mrs. Sylvie must certainly know the competition, if there is any, so she can tell youâ€”â€

Jamie drew a hand down over his face, pulling down his lower eyelids so that the bloodshot appearance of his eyes was particularly emphasized.

â€œA brothel,â€ he repeated. â€œYe want me to go to a brothel.â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™ll go with you if you like, of course,â€ I said. â€œThough I think you might manage better alone. Iâ€™d do it myself,â€ I added, with some asperity, â€œbut I think they might not pay any attention to me.â€

He closed one eye, regarding me through the other, which looked as though it had been sandpapered.

â€œOh, I rather think they would,â€ he said. â€œSo this is what ye had in mind when ye insisted on coming to town with me, is it?â€ He sounded a trifle bitter.

â€œWell . . . yes,â€ I admitted. â€œThough I really did need cinchona bark. Besides,â€ I added logically, â€œif I hadnâ€™t come, you wouldnâ€™t have found out about Bonnet. Or Lucas, for that matter.â€

He said something in Gaelic, which I interpreted roughly as an indication that he could have lived quite happily in ignorance of either party.

â€œBesides, youâ€™re quite accustomed to brothels,â€ I pointed out. â€œYou had a room in one, in Edinburgh!â€

â€œAye, I did,â€ he agreed. â€œBut I wasna marrit, thenâ€”or rather I was, but Iâ€”aye, well, I mean it quite suited me, at the time, to have folk think that Iâ€”â€ He broke off and looked at me pleadingly. â€œSassenach, dâ€™ye honestly want everyone in Cross Creek to think that Iâ€”â€

â€œWell, they wonâ€™t think that if I go with you, will they?â€

â€œOh, God.â€

At this point, he dropped his head into his hands and massaged his scalp vigorously, presumably under the impression that this would help him figure out some means of thwarting me.

â€œWhere is your sense of compassion for your fellow man?â€ I demanded. â€œYou wouldnâ€™t want some hapless fellow to be facing a session with Dr. Fentimanâ€™s syringe, just because youâ€”â€

â€œAs long as Iâ€™m no required to face it myself,â€ he assured me, raising his head, â€œmy fellow man is welcome to the wages of sin, and serve him just right, too.â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™m rather inclined to agree,â€ I admitted. â€œBut it isnâ€™t only them. Itâ€™s the women. Not just the whores; what about all the wivesâ€”and the childrenâ€”of the men who get infected? You canâ€™t let all of them die of the pox, if they can be saved, surely?â€

He had by this time assumed the aspect of a hunted animal, and this line of reasoning did not improve it.

â€œButâ€”the penicillin doesna always work,â€ he pointed out. â€œWhat if it doesna work on the whores?â€

â€œItâ€™s a possibility,â€ I admitted. â€œBut between trying something that might not workâ€”and not trying at all . . .â€ Seeing him still looking squiggle-eyed, I dropped the appeal to reason and resorted to my best weapon.

â€œWhat about Young Ian?â€

â€œWhat about him?â€ he replied warily, but I could see that my words had caused an instant vision to spring up in his mind. Ian was not a stranger to brothelsâ€”thanks to Jamie, inadvertent and involuntary as the introduction had been.

â€œHeâ€™s a good lad, Ian,â€ he said, stoutly. â€œHe wouldna . . .â€

â€œHe might,â€ I said. â€œAnd you know it.â€

I had no idea of the shape of Young Ianâ€™s private lifeâ€”if he had one. But he was twenty-one, unattached, and so far as I could see, a completely healthy young male of the species. Hence . . .

I could see Jamie coming reluctantly to the same conclusions. He had been a virgin when I married him, at the age of twenty-three. Young Ian, owing to factors beyond everyoneâ€™s control, had been introduced to the ways of the flesh at a substantially earlier age. And that particular innocence could not be regained.

â€œMmphm,â€ he said.

He picked up the towel, rubbed his hair ferociously with it, then flung it aside, and gathered back the thick, damp tail, reaching for a thong to bind it.

â€œIf it were done when â€™tis done, â€™twere well it were done quickly,â€ I said, watching with approval. â€œI think Iâ€™d best come, too, though. Let me fetch my box.â€

He made no response to this, merely setting grimly about the task of making himself presentable. Luckily he hadnâ€™t been wearing his coat or waistcoat during the contretemps in the street, so was able to cover the worst of the damage to his shirt.

â€œSassenach,â€ he said, and I turned to find him regarding me with a bloodshot glint.

â€œYes?â€

â€œYeâ€™ll pay for this.â€



MRS. SYLVIEâ€™S ESTABLISHMENT was a perfectly ordinary-looking two-storied house, small and rather shabby. Its shingles were curling up at the ends, giving it a slight air of disheveled surprise, like a woman taken unawares with her hair just out of rollers.

Jamie made disapproving Scottish noises in his throat at sight of the sagging stoop and overgrown yard, but I assumed that this was merely his way of covering discomfiture.

I was not quite sure what I had been expecting Mrs. Sylvie to beâ€”the only madam of my acquaintance having been a rather elegant French Ã©migrÃ© in Edinburghâ€”but the proprietor of Cross Creekâ€™s most popular bawdy house was a woman of about twenty-five, with a face as plain as piecrust, and extremely prominent ears.

In fact, I had momentarily assumed her to be the maid, and only Jamieâ€™s greeting her politely as â€œMrs. Sylvieâ€ informed me that the madam herself had answered the door. I gave Jamie a sideways look, wondering just how he came to be acquainted with her, but then looked again and realized that he had noted the good quality of her gown and the large brooch upon her bosom.

She looked from him to me, and frowned.

â€œMay we come in?â€ I said, and did so, not waiting for an answer.

â€œIâ€™m Mrs. Fraser, and this is my husband,â€ I said, gesturing toward Jamie, who was looking pink around the ears already.

â€œOh?â€ Mrs. Sylvie said warily. â€œWell, itâ€™ll be a pound extra, if itâ€™s the two of you.â€

â€œI beg yourâ€”oh!â€ Hot blood flooded my face as I belatedly grasped her meaning. Jamie had got it instantly, and was the color of beetroot.

â€œItâ€™s quite all right,â€ she assured me. â€œNot the usual, to be sure, but Dottie wouldnâ€™t mind a bit, she being summat partial to women, you see.â€

Jamie made a low growling noise, indicating that this was my idea and it was up to me to be carrying it out.

â€œIâ€™m afraid we didnâ€™t make ourselves clear,â€ I said, as charmingly as possible. â€œWe . . . er . . . we merely wish to interview yourâ€”â€ I stopped, groping for an appropriate word. Not â€œemployees,â€ surely.

â€œGirls,â€ Jamie put in tersely.

â€œUm, yes. Girls.â€

â€œOh, you do.â€ Her small bright eyes darted back and forth between us. â€œMethody, are you? Or Bright Light Baptists? Well, thatâ€™ll be two pound, then. For the nuisance.â€

Jamie laughed.

â€œCheap at the price,â€ he observed. â€œOr is that per girl?â€

Mrs. Sylvieâ€™s mouth twitched a little.

â€œOh, per girl, to be sure.â€

â€œTwo pound per soul? Aye, well, who would put a price on salvation?â€ He was openly teasing now, and sheâ€”having plainly made out that we were neither potential clients nor door-to-door missionariesâ€”was amused, but taking care not to seem so.

â€œI would,â€ she replied dryly. â€œA whore knows the price of everything but the value of nothingâ€”or so Iâ€™ve been told.â€

Jamie nodded at this.

â€œAye. Whatâ€™s the price of one of your girlsâ€™ lives, then, Mrs. Sylvie?â€

The look of amusement vanished from her eyes, leaving them just as bright, but fiercely wary.

â€œDo you threaten me, sir?â€ She drew herself up tall, and put her hand on a bell that stood on the table near the door. â€œI have protection, sir, I assure you. You would be well-advised to leave at once.â€

â€œIf I wished to damage ye, woman, I should scarcely bring my wife along to watch,â€ Jamie said mildly. â€œIâ€™m no so much a pervert as all that.â€

Her hand, tight on the bellâ€™s handle, relaxed a bit.

â€œYouâ€™d be surprised,â€ she said. â€œMind,â€ she said, pointing a finger at him, â€œI donâ€™t deal in such thingsâ€”never think itâ€”but Iâ€™ve seen them.â€

â€œSo have I,â€ said Jamie, the teasing tone gone from his voice. â€œTell me, have ye maybe heard of a Scotsman called Mac Dubh?â€

Her face changed at that; clearly she had. I was bewildered, but had the sense to keep quiet.

â€œI have,â€ she said. Her gaze had sharpened. â€œThat was you, was it?â€

He bowed gravely.

Mrs. Sylvieâ€™s mouth pursed briefly, then she seemed to notice me again.

â€œDid he tell you?â€ she asked.

â€œI doubt it,â€ I said, giving him an eye. He sedulously avoided my glance.

Mrs. Sylvie uttered a short laugh.

â€œOne of my girls went with a man to the Toadâ€â€”naming a low sort of dive near the river, called the Toad and Spoonâ€”â€œand he dealt badly with her. Then dragged her out to the taproom and offered her to the men there. She said she knew she was deadâ€”you know it is possible to be raped to death?â€ This last was addressed to me, in a tone that mingled aloofness with challenge.

â€œI do,â€ I said, very shortly. A brief qualm ran through me and my palms began to sweat.

â€œA big Scotchman was there, though, and he took issue with the proposal, apparently. It was him alone, though, against a mobâ€”â€

â€œYour specialty,â€ I said to Jamie, under my breath, and he coughed.

â€œâ€”but he suggested that they deal cards for the girl. Played a game of brag, and won.â€

â€œReally?â€ I said politely. Cheating at cards was another of his specialties, but one I tried to discourage his using, convinced that it would get him killed one day. No wonder he hadnâ€™t told me about this particular adventure.

â€œSo he picked up Alice, wrapped her in his plaid, and brought her homeâ€”left her at the door.â€

She looked at Jamie with grudging admiration.

â€œSo. Have you come to claim a debt, then? You have my thanks, for what they may be worth.â€

â€œA great deal, madam,â€ he said quietly. â€œBut no. Weâ€™ve come to try to save your girls from worse than drunken raparees.â€

Her thin brows arched high in question.

â€œFrom the pox,â€ I said baldly. Her mouth fell open.

For all her relative youth, Mrs. Sylvie was a hard customer, and no easy sell. While fear of the pox was a constant factor in the life of a whore, talk of spirochetes cut no ice with her, and my proposition that I inject her staffâ€”there were only three girls, it appearedâ€”with penicillin met with a firm refusal.

Jamie allowed the wrangling to go on until it became clear we had reached a stone wall. Then he came in on a different tack.

â€œMy wife isna proposing such a course only from the goodness of her heart, ken?â€ he said. By now, we had been invited to sit, in a neat little parlor adorned with gingham curtains, and he leaned forward gingerly, so as not to strain the joints of the delicate chair he was sitting on.

â€œThe son of a friend came to my wife, saying heâ€™d contracted the syphilis from a whore in Hillsboro. She saw the sore; there is no question but that the lad is poxed. He panicked, though, before she was able to treat him, and ran. We have been looking for him ever sinceâ€”and heard just yesterday that he had been seen here, in your establishment.â€

Mrs. Sylvie lost control of her face for an instant. It was back in a moment, but there was no mistaking the look of horror.

â€œWho?â€ she said hoarsely. â€œA Scotch lad? What did he look like?â€

Jamie exchanged a brief, quizzical glance with me, and described Manfred McGillivray. By the time he had finished, the young madamâ€™s face was white as a sheet.

â€œI had him,â€ she said. â€œTwice. Oh, Jesus.â€ She took a couple of deep breaths, though, and rallied.

â€œHe was clean, though! I made him show meâ€”I always do.â€

I explained that while the chancre healed, the disease remained in the blood, only to emerge later. After all, had she not known of whores who contracted syphilis, without any exhibition of a previous sore?

â€œYes, of courseâ€”but they canâ€™t have taken proper care,â€ she said, jaw set stubbornly. â€œI always do, and my girls, too. I insist upon it.â€

I could see denial setting in. Rather than admit she might be harboring a deadly infection, she would insist it was not possible, and within moments would have talked herself into believing it and would throw us out.

Jamie could see it, too.

â€œMrs. Sylvie,â€ he said, interrupting her flow of justifications. She looked at him, blinking.

â€œHave ye a deck of cards in the house?â€

â€œWhat? Iâ€”yes, of course.â€

â€œBring them, then,â€ he said with a smile. â€œGleek, loo, or brag, your choice.â€

She gave him a long, hard look, her mouth pressed tight. Then it relaxed a little.

â€œHonest cards?â€ she asked, and a small gleam showed in her eye. â€œAnd for what stakes?â€

â€œHonest cards,â€ he assured her. â€œIf I win, my wife injects the lot of ye.â€

â€œAnd if you lose?â€

â€œA cask of my best whisky.â€

She hesitated a moment longer, eyeing him narrowly, estimating the odds. There was still a blob of tar in his hair, and feathers on his coat, but his eyes were deep blue and guileless. She sighed, and put out a hand.

â€œDone,â€ she said.



â€œDID YOU CHEAT?â€ I asked, grasping his arm to keep from stumbling. It was well after dark by now, and the streets of Cross Creek were not lighted, save by starlight.

â€œDidna have to,â€ he said, and yawned hugely. â€œShe may be a good whore, but sheâ€™s no hand at cards. She should have chosen loo; thatâ€™s mostly luck, while brag takes skill. Easier to cheat at loo, though,â€ he added, blinking.

â€œWhat, exactly, constitutes a good whore?â€ I asked curiously. I had never considered the question of qualifications anent that profession, but supposed there must be some, beyond possession of the requisite anatomy and a willingness to make it available.

He laughed at that, but scratched his head, considering.

â€œWell, it helps if she has a genuine liking for men, but doesna take them verra serious. And if she likes to go to bed, thatâ€™s as well, too. Ouch.â€ I had stepped on a rock, and tightening my grip on his arm, had got him on the patch of skin burned by tar earlier in the day.

â€œOh, sorry. Is it bad? I have a bit of balm I can put on it, when we get to the inn.â€

â€œOch, no. Just blisters; it will bide.â€ He rubbed his arm gingerly, but shrugged off the discomfort, and taking me by the elbow, led me round the corner, toward the main street. We had decided earlier that since we might be late, we would stay at McLanahanâ€™s Kingâ€™s Inn, rather than make the long drive back to River Run.

The smell of hot tar still permeated this end of town, and the evening breeze swirled feathers into small drifts at the side of the road; now and then, a down feather floated past my ear like a slow-moving moth.

â€œI wonder, are they still picking the feathers off Neil Forbes?â€ Jamie said, a grin in his voice.

â€œMaybe his wife will just put a bolster cover on him and use him as a pillow,â€ I suggested. â€œNo, wait, he hasnâ€™t got a wife. Theyâ€™ll have toâ€”â€

â€œCall him a rooster, and put him out in the yard to serve the hens,â€ Jamie suggested, giggling. â€œHeâ€™s a fine cock-a-doodle, if no much in the way of a cock.â€

He wasnâ€™t drunkâ€”we had drunk weak coffee with Mrs. Sylvie, after the injectionsâ€”but he was desperately tired; we both were, and suddenly in the state of exhaustion where the lamest joke seems immensely funny, and we staggered, bumping together and laughing at worse and worse jokes until our eyes teared.

â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ Jamie said suddenly, drawing a deep, startled breath through his nose. â€œWhatâ€™s burning?â€

Something substantial; there was a glow in the sky, visible over the roofs of the nearby houses, and the sharp scent of burning wood suddenly overlaid the thicker smell of hot tar. Jamie ran toward the corner of the street, with me hot on his heels.

It was Mr. Simmsâ€™s print shop; well ablaze. Evidently his political enemies, balked of their prey, had decided to vent their animosity on his premises.

A knot of men was milling in the street, much as they had earlier in the day. Again, there were calls of â€œTory!â€ and a few were brandishing torches. More men were running down the street toward the scene of the fire, shouting. I caught a bellow of â€œGoddamn Whigs!â€ and then the two groups collided in a flurry of shoving and punching.

Jamie grabbed my arm and propelled me back the way we had come, out of sight around the corner. My heart was pounding, and I was short of breath; we ducked under a tree and stood panting.

â€œWell,â€ I said, after a short silence, filled with the shouts of the riot, â€œI suppose Fergus will have to find a different occupation. Thereâ€™s an apothecaryâ€™s shop going cheap, I know.â€

Jamie made a small sound, not quite a laugh.

â€œHeâ€™d do better to go into partnership wiâ€™ Mrs. Sylvie,â€ he said. â€œThereâ€™s a business not subject to politics. Come on, Sassenachâ€”weâ€™ll go the long way round.â€

When at length we reached the inn, we found Young Ian fidgeting on the porch, watching out for us.

â€œWhere in the name of Bride have you been?â€ he demanded severely, in a manner that made me think suddenly of his mother. â€œWeâ€™ve been combinâ€™ the town for ye, Uncle Jamie, and Fergus sure yeâ€™d been caught up in the collieshangie yonder and maimed or killed.â€ He nodded toward the print shop; the blaze was beginning to die, though there was still enough light from it to see his face, set in a disapproving frown.

â€œWeâ€™ve been doing good deeds,â€ Jamie assured him piously. â€œVisiting the sick, as Christ commands us.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ Ian responded, with considerable cynicism. â€œHe said ye should visit those in prison, too. Too bad ye didna start wiâ€™ that.â€

â€œWhat? Why?â€

â€œYon bugger Donnerâ€™s escaped, thatâ€™s for why,â€ Ian informed him, seeming to take a grim pleasure in imparting bad news. â€œDuring the fight this afternoon. The gaoler came to join in the fun, and left the door on the latch; the bugger just walked out and awaâ€™.â€

Jamie inhaled deeply, then let his breath out slowly, coughing slightly from the smoke.

â€œAye, well,â€ he said. â€œSo weâ€™re down by one print shop and one thiefâ€”but four whores to the good. Dâ€™ye think that a fair exchange, Sassenach?â€

â€œWhores?â€ Ian exclaimed, startled. â€œWhat whores?â€

â€œMrs. Sylvieâ€™s,â€ I said, peering at him. He looked shifty, though perhaps it was only the light. â€œIan! You didnâ€™t!â€

â€œWell, of course he did, Sassenach,â€ Jamie said, resigned. â€œLook at him.â€ A guilty expression was spreading over Ianâ€™s features like an oil slick on water, easy to make out, even by the flickering, ruddy light of the dying fire.

â€œI found out about Manfred,â€ Ian offered hastily. â€œHe went downriver, meaning to find a ship in Wilmington.â€

â€œYes, we found that out, too,â€ I said a little testily. â€œWho was it? Mrs. Sylvie or one of the girls?â€

His large Adamâ€™s apple bobbed nervously.

â€œMrs. Sylvie,â€ he said in a low voice.

â€œRight,â€ I said. â€œFortunately, I have some penicillin leftâ€”and a nice, dull syringe. Inside with you, Ian, you abandoned wretch, and down with your breeks.â€

Mrs. McLanahan, emerging onto the porch to inquire whether we would like a bit of late supper, overheard this and gave me a startled look, but I was well past caring.

Sometime later, we lay at last in the haven of a clean bed, safe from the upheavals and turmoils of the day. I had pried the window open, and the faintest of breezes disturbed the heaviness of the thick, hot air. Several soft gray flecks drifted in, feathers or bits of ash, spiraling like snowflakes toward the floor.

Jamieâ€™s arm lay across me, and I could make out the soft, glaucous shapes of the blisters that covered most of his forearm. The air was harsh with burning, but the smell of tar lay like an abiding threat beneath. The men who had burned Simmsâ€™s shopâ€”and come so close to burning Simms, and likely Jamie, as wellâ€”were rebels in the making, men who would be called patriots.

â€œI can hear ye thinking, Sassenach,â€ he said. He sounded peaceful, on the verge of sleep. â€œWhat is it?â€

â€œI was thinking of tar and feathers,â€ I said softly, and very gently touched his arm. â€œJamieâ€”itâ€™s time.â€

â€œI know,â€ he answered just as softly.

Some men went by in the street outside, singing drunkenly, with torches; the flickering light flowed across the ceiling and was gone. I could feel Jamie watch it go, listening to the raucous voices as they faded down the street, but he said nothing, and after a bit, the big body that cradled me began to relax, sinking once again toward sleep.

â€œWhat are you thinking?â€ I whispered, not sure whether he could still hear me. He could.

â€œI was thinking that yeâ€™d make a really good whore, Sassenach, were ye at all promiscuous,â€ he replied drowsily.

â€œWhat?â€ I said, quite startled.

â€œBut Iâ€™m glad yeâ€™re not,â€ he added, and began to snore.

THE MINISTERâ€™S RETURN




September 4, 1774

ROGER STEERED CLEAR OF Coopersville on his way home. It wasnâ€™t that he feared Ute McGillivrayâ€™s wrath, but he didnâ€™t want to tarnish the happiness of his homecoming with coldness nor confrontation. Instead, he took the long way round, winding his way gradually up the steep slope toward the Ridge, pushing through overgrown parts where the forest had taken back the path, and fording small streams.

His mule splashed out of the last of these at the base of the trail, shaking itself and scattering droplets from its belly. Pausing to wipe sweat from his face, he spotted a movement on a large stone by the bank. Aidan, fishing, affecting not to have seen him.

Roger reined Clarence up alongside and watched for a moment, saying nothing. Then he asked, â€œAre they biting well?â€

â€œTolerable,â€ Aidan replied, squinting hard at his line. Then he looked up, a huge grin splitting his face from ear to ear, and flinging down his pole, sprang up, reaching with both hands, so that Roger could grasp his skinny wrists and swing him up onto the saddle in front of him.

â€œYeâ€™re back!â€ he exclaimed, throwing his arms about Roger and burying his face happily in Rogerâ€™s chest. â€œI waited for ye. Are ye a real minister now, then?â€

â€œAmost. Howâ€™d ye know Iâ€™d be along today?â€

Aidan shrugged. â€œIâ€™ve been waitinâ€™ the best part of a week, have I no?â€ He looked up into Rogerâ€™s face, round-eyed and quizzical. â€œYe dinna look any different.â€

â€œIâ€™m not,â€ Roger assured him, smiling. â€œHowâ€™s the belly?â€

â€œPrime. Ye want to see my scar?â€ He leaned back, pulling up his ratty shirttail to display a neat red four-inch weal across the pallid skin.

â€œWell done,â€ Roger approved. â€œTaking care of your Mam and wee Orrie, then, now yeâ€™re mended, I suppose.â€

â€œOh, aye.â€ Aidan puffed his narrow chest. â€œI brought home six trout for supper last night, and the biggest one the size of me arm!â€ He stuck out a forearm in illustration.

â€œAh, get on wiâ€™ ye.â€

â€œI did, then!â€ Aidan said indignantly, then twigged that he was being teased, and grinned.

Clarence was becoming restive, wanting home, and turned in little circles, stamping his feet and twitching at the reins.

â€œBest go. Ye want to ride up wiâ€™ me?â€

Aidan looked tempted, but shook his head.

â€œNah, then. I promised Mrs. Ogilvie as I should come tell her, the minute ye came.â€

Roger was surprised at that.

â€œOh, aye? Whyâ€™s that?â€

â€œSheâ€™s had a wean last week, what she wants ye to baptize.â€

â€œOh?â€ His heart rose a little at that, and the bubble of happiness he carried inside him seemed to expand a little. His first christening! Or ratherâ€”his first official baptism, he thought, with a small pang at the memory of the small Oâ€™Brian girl he had buried without a name. He wouldnâ€™t be able to do it until after his ordination, but it was something to look forward to.

â€œTell her Iâ€™ll be glad to christen the wean,â€ he said, lowering Aidan to the ground. â€œHave her send to tell me when. And dinna forget your wee fish!â€ he called.

Aidan grabbed up his pole and the string of silvery fishâ€”none of them longer than the length of a handâ€”and plunged off into the wood, leaving Roger to turn Clarenceâ€™s head toward home.

He smelled smoke from a good way down the trail. Stronger than chimney smoke. With all the talk he had heard on his way, regarding the recent events in Cross Creek, he couldnâ€™t help a small feeling of uneasiness, and urged Clarence on with a nudge of the heels. Clarence, scenting home even through the smoke, took the hint with alacrity, and trotted briskly up the steep incline.

The smell of smoke grew stronger, mixed with an odd musty sort of scent that seemed vaguely familiar. A visible haze grew among the trees, and when they burst out of the undergrowth into the clearing, he was nearly standing in his stirrups with agitation.

The cabin stood, weathered and solid, and relief dropped him back in the saddle with a force that made Clarence grunt in protest. Smoke rose around the house in thick swirls, though, and the figure of Brianna, swathed like a Muslim with a scarf around her head and face, was dimly visible in the midst of it. He dismounted, took a breath to call out to her, and immediately suffered a coughing fit. The damned groundhog kiln was open, belching smoke like hellâ€™s chimney, and now he recognized the musty scentâ€”scorched earth.

â€œRoger! Roger!â€ Sheâ€™d seen him, and came running, skirts and scarf ends flying, leaping a stack of cut turves like a mountain goat to hurl herself into his arms.

He grabbed her and held on, thinking that nothing in life had ever felt better lid weight of her against him and the taste of her mouth, in spite of the fact that sheâ€™d plainly eaten onions for lunch.

She emerged beaming and wet-eyed from the embrace, long enough to say, â€œI love you!â€ then grabbed his face and kissed him again. â€œI missed you. When did you shave last? I love you.â€

â€œFour days ago, when I left Charlotte. I love you, too. Is everything all right?â€

â€œSure. Well, actually no. Jemmy fell out of a tree and knocked out a tooth, but it was a baby tooth and Mama says she doesnâ€™t think it will hurt the permanent one coming in. And Ian got exposed to syphilis, maybe, and weâ€™re all disgusted with him, and Da was nearly tarred and feathered in Cross Creek, and we met Flora MacDonald, and Mama stuck a needle in Aunt Jocastaâ€™s eye, andâ€”â€

â€œEugh!â€ Roger said in instinctive revulsion. â€œWhy?â€

â€œSo it wouldnâ€™t burst. And I got paid six pounds in painting commissions!â€ she concluded triumphantly. â€œI bought some fine wire and silk to make paper screens with, and enough wool for a winter cloak for you. Itâ€™s green. The biggest thing, though, is we met anotherâ€”well, Iâ€™ll tell you about that later; itâ€™s complicated. How did it go with the Presbyterians? Is it all right? Are you a minister?â€

He shook his head, trying to decide which part of this cataract to respond to, and ended up choosing the last bit, only because he could remember it.

â€œSort of. Have you been taking lessons in incoherence from Mrs. Bug?â€

â€œHow can you be sort of a minister? Waitâ€”tell me in a minute, I have to open it up some more.â€

With that, she was flitting back across the broken ground toward the gaping hole of the kiln. The tall clay-brick chimney stack rose at one end, looking like a headstone. The scorched turves that had covered it in operation were scattered round it, and the general impression was that of an enormous, smoking grave from which something large, hot, and doubtless demonic had just arisen. Had he been Catholic, he would have crossed himself.

As it was, he advanced carefully toward the edge, where Brianna was kneeling, reaching across with her shovel to remove another layer of turves from the willow-work frame that arched across the top of the pit.

Looking down through a roiling haze of smoke, he could see irregularly shaped objects, lying on the earthen shelves that lined the pit. A few he could make out as being bowls or platters. Most of them, though, were vaguely tubular objects, two or three feet long, tapered and rounded at one end, the other slightly flared. They were a dark pinkish color, streaked and darkened with smoke, and looked like nothing so much as a collection of giant barbecued phalluses, a notion that he found nearly as disturbing as the story of Jocastaâ€™s eyeball.

â€œPipes,â€ Brianna said proudly, pointing her shovel at one of these objects. â€œFor water. Lookâ€”theyâ€™re perfect! Or they will be, if they donâ€™t crack while theyâ€™re cooling.â€

â€œTerrific,â€ Roger said, with a decent show of enthusiasm. â€œHeyâ€”I brought ye a present.â€ Reaching into the side pocket of his coat, he brought out an orange, which she seized with a cry of delight, though she paused for an instant before digging her thumb into the peel.

â€œNo, you eat it; Iâ€™ve got another for Jem,â€ he assured her.

â€œI love you,â€ she said again, fervently, juice running down her chin. â€œWhat about the Presbyterians? What did they say?â€

â€œOh. Well, basically, itâ€™s all right. I have got the university degree, and enough Greek and Latin to impress them. The Hebrew was a bit lacking, but if I mug that up in the meantimeâ€”Reverend Caldwell gave me a book.â€ He patted the side of his coat.

â€œYes, I can just see you preaching in Hebrew to the Crombies and Buchanans,â€ she said grinning. â€œSo? What else?â€

There was a fleck of orange pulp stuck to her lip, and he bent on impulse and kissed it off, the tiny burst of sweetness rich and tart on his tongue.

â€œWell, they examined me as to doctrine and understanding, and we talked a great deal; prayed together for discernment.â€ He felt somewhat shy talking to her about it. It had been a remarkable experience, like returning to a home heâ€™d never known heâ€™d missed. To confess his calling had been joyful; to do it among people who understood and shared it . . .

â€œSo Iâ€™m provisionally a minister of the Word,â€ he said, looking down at the toes of his boots. â€œIâ€™ll need to be ordained before I can administer sacraments like marriage and baptism, but that will have to wait until thereâ€™a Presbytery Session held somewhere. In the meantime, I can preach, teach, and bury.â€

She was looking at him, smiling, but a little wistfully.

â€œYouâ€™re happy?â€ she said, and he nodded, unable to speak for a moment.

â€œVery happy,â€ he said at last, his voice hardly audible.

â€œGood,â€ she said softly, and smiled a little more genuinely. â€œI understand. So now youâ€™re sort of handfast with God, is that it?â€

He laughed, and felt his throat ease. God, heâ€™d have to do something about that; he couldnâ€™t be preaching drunk every Sunday. Talk of giving scandal to the faithful . . .

â€œAye, thatâ€™s it. But Iâ€™m properly married to youâ€”Iâ€™ll not forget it.â€

â€œSee that you donâ€™t.â€ Her smile now was wholehearted. â€œSince we are married . . .â€ She gave him a very direct look, one that went through him like a mild electric shock. â€œJemâ€™s at Marsaliâ€™s, playing with Germain. And Iâ€™ve never made love to a minister before. It seems kind of wicked and depraved, donâ€™t you think?â€

He took a deep breath, but it didnâ€™t help; he still felt giddy and light-headed, doubtless from the smoke.

â€œBehold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant,â€ he said, â€œand our bed is green. The joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman. Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.â€ He reached out and touched her, gently.

â€œThy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.â€

â€œThey are?â€

â€œItâ€™s in the Bible,â€ he assured her gravely. â€œIt must be so, aye?â€

â€œTell me more about my navel,â€ she said, but before he could, he saw a small form bounding out of the woods and haring toward them. Aidan, now fishless and panting.

â€œMrs. Ogil . . . vie says . . . come now!â€ he blurted. He gasped a little, recovering enough breath for the rest of the message. â€œThe weanâ€”sheâ€™s poorly, and they want her christened, in case she should die.â€

Roger clapped a hand to his other side; The Book of Common Worship that theyâ€™d given him in Charlotte was a small, reassuring weight in his pocket.

â€œCan you?â€ Brianna was looking at him worriedly. â€œCatholics canâ€”I mean, a lay person can baptize somebody if itâ€™s an emergency.â€

â€œYes, in that caseâ€”yes,â€ he said, more breathless than heâ€™d been a moment before. He glanced at Brianna, smudged with soot and dirt, her garments reeking of smoke and baked clay rather than myrrh and aloes.

â€œDâ€™ye want to come?â€ He urgently wanted her to say yes.

â€œWouldnâ€™t miss it for the world,â€ she assured him, and discarding the filthy scarf, shook out her hair, bright as banners on the wind.



IT WAS THE OGILVIESâ€™ first child, a tiny girl whom Briannaâ€”with the experience of long motherhoodâ€”diagnosed as suffering from a vicious colic, but basically in good health. The frighteningly young parentsâ€”they both looked about fifteenâ€”were pathetically grateful for everything: Briannaâ€™s reassurances and advice, her offer to have Claire visit (for they were much too scared to think of approaching the lairdâ€™s wife themselves, leave alone the stories they had heard of her) with medicine and food, and most of all, for Rogerâ€™s coming to baptize the baby.

That a real ministerâ€”for they could not be convinced otherwiseâ€”should appear in this wilderness, and condescend to come confer the blessing of God upon their childâ€”they were overwhelmed by their good fortune.

Roger and Brianna stayed for some time, and left as the sun was going down, glowing with the faintly self-conscious pleasure of doing good.

â€œPoor things,â€ Brianna said, voice trembling between sympathy and amusement.

â€œPoor wee things,â€ Roger agreed, sharing her sentiments. The christening had gone beautifully; even the screaming, purple-faced infant had suspended operations long enough for him to pour the water on her bald head and claim heavenâ€™s protection for her soul. He felt the greatest joy in it, and immense humility at having been allowed to perform the ceremony. There was only the one thingâ€”and his feelings were still confused between embarrassed pride and deep dismay.

â€œHer nameâ€”â€ Brianna said, and stopped, shaking her head.

â€œI tried to stop them,â€ he said, trying to control his voice. â€œI did tryâ€”youâ€™re my witness. Elizabeth, I said. Mairi. Elspeth, perhaps. You heard me!â€

â€œOh, now,â€ she said, and her voice trembled. â€œI think Rogerina is a perfectly beautiful name.â€ Then she lost control, sat down in the grass, and laughed like a hyena.

â€œOh, God, the poor wee lassie,â€ he said, tryingâ€”and failingâ€”not to laugh himself. â€œIâ€™ve heard of Thomasina, and even Jamesina, but . . . oh, God.â€

â€œMaybe theyâ€™ll call her Ina for short,â€ Brianna suggested, snuffling and wiping her face on her apron. â€œOr they can spell it backwardâ€”Aniregorâ€”and call her Annie.â€

â€œOh, youâ€™re a great comfort,â€ Roger said dryly, and reached down to haul her to her feet.

She leaned against him and put her arms round him, still vibrating with laughter. She smelled of oranges and burning, and the light of the setting sun rippled in her hair.

Finally, she stopped, and lifted her head from his shoulder.

â€œI am my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved is mine,â€ she said, and kissed him. â€œYou did good, Reverend. Letâ€™s go home.â€





PART EIGHT




The Call





58




LOVE ONE ANOTHER




ROGER TOOK THE DEEPEST breath he could, and shouted as loudly as he could. Which was not very damn loud. Again. And again.

It hurt. It was aggravating, too; the feeble, choked sound of it made him want to shut up and never open his mouth again. He breathed, shut his eyes, and screamed with all his might, or tried to.

A searing flash of pain shot down inside his throat on the right, and he broke off, gasping. All right. He breathed gingerly for a moment, swallowing, then did it again.

Jesus, that hurt.

He rubbed a sleeve across his watering eyes and braced himself for another go. As he inflated his chest, fists curling, he heard voices, and let the breath out.

The voices were calling to each other, not far from him, but the wind was away and he couldnâ€™t make out the words. Likely hunters, though. It was a fine fall day, with air like blue wine and the forest restless with dappled light.

The leaves had just begun to turn, but some were already falling, a silent, constant flicker at the edge of vision. Any movement could look like game in such surroundings, he knew that well. He drew breath to call out, hesitated, and said, â€œShit,â€ under his breath. Great. Heâ€™d rather be shot in mistake for a deer than embarrass himself by calling out.

â€œAss,â€ he said to himself, drew breath, and shouted, â€œHalloooo!â€ at the top of his voiceâ€”reedy and without volume as it was. Again. Again. And yet again. By the fifth time, he was beginning to think heâ€™d rather be shot than go on trying to make them hear him, but at last a faint â€œHalloooo!â€ drifted back to him on the crisp, light air.

He stopped, relieved, and coughed, surprised not to be bringing up blood; his throat felt like raw meat. But he essayed a quick hum, then, cautiously, a rising arpeggio. An octave. Just barely, and it was a strain that sent shooting pains through his larynxâ€”but a full octave. The first time heâ€™d managed that much of a range in pitch since the injury.

Encouraged by this small evidence of progress, he greeted the hunters cheerfully when they came in view: Allan Christie and Ian Murray, both with long rifles in hand.

â€œPreacher MacKenzie!â€ Allan greeted him, grinning, like an incongruously friendly owl. â€œWhat are you doing out here all on your owney-o? Rehearsing your first sermon?â€

â€œAs a matter of fact, yes,â€ Roger said pleasantly. It was true, in a wayâ€”and there was no other good explanation for what he was doing out in the woods by himself, lacking weapons, snare, or fishing pole.

â€œWell, best make it good,â€ Allan said, wagging his head. â€œEveryone will be coming. Daâ€™s had Malva hard at it from dawn to dusk, sweeping and cleaning.â€

â€œAh? Well, do tell her I appreciate it, will ye?â€ After a good deal of thought, heâ€™d asked Thomas Christie whether the Sunday services might be held in the schoolmasterâ€™s home. It was no more than a rude cabin, like most on the Ridge, but since lessons were held there, the main room was somewhat more commodious than the average. And while Jamie Fraser would certainly have allowed the use of the Big House, Roger felt that his congregationâ€”what a daunting wordâ€”might well be uneasy at holding their services in the house of a Papist, accommodating and tolerant though said Papist might be.

â€œYeâ€™re coming, are ye not?â€ Allan was asking Ian. Ian looked surprised at the invitation, and rubbed an uncertain knuckle beneath his nose.

â€œOch, well, but I was baptized Romish, eh?â€

â€œWell, yeâ€™re a Christian, at least?â€ Allan said with some impatience. â€œOr no? Some folk do say as how ye turned pagan, with the Indians, and didna turn back.â€

â€œDo they?â€ Ian spoke mildly, but Roger saw his face tighten a little at that. He noticed with interest that Ian didnâ€™t answer the question, though, instead asking him, â€œWill your wife come to hear ye, cousin?â€

â€œShe will,â€ he said, mentally crossing his fingers against the day, â€œand wee Jem, too.â€

â€œHowâ€™s this?â€ Bree had asked him, fixing him with a look of rapt intensity, chin slightly lifted, lips just a fraction of an inch apart. â€œJackie Kennedy. That about right, do you think, or shall I aim for Queen Elizabeth reviewing the troops?â€ Her lips compressed, the chin drew in a bit, and her mobile face altered from rapt attention to dignified approbation.

â€œOh, Mrs. Kennedy, by all means,â€ heâ€™d assured her. Heâ€™d be pleased if she kept a straight face, let alone anyone elseâ€™s.

â€œAye, well, Iâ€™ll come along thenâ€”if ye dinna think anyone would take it amiss,â€ Ian added formally to Allan, who dismissed the notion with a hospitable flap of the hand.

â€œOh, everyone will be there,â€ he repeated. The notion made Rogerâ€™s stomach contract slightly.

â€œOut after deer, are ye?â€ he asked with a nod toward the rifles, in hopes of turning the conversation toward something other than his own impending debut as a preacher.

â€œAye,â€ Allan answered, â€œbut then we heard a painter screech, off this way.â€ He nodded, indicating the wood just around them. â€œIan said if thereâ€™s a painter about, the deer will be long gone.â€

Roger shot a narrow glance at Ian, whose unnaturally blank expression told him more than he wanted to know. Allan Christie, born and raised in Edinburgh, might not know a pantherâ€™s scream from a manâ€™s, but Ian most assuredly did.

â€œToo bad if itâ€™s frightened away the game,â€ he said, lifting one brow at Ian. â€œCome on, then; Iâ€™ll walk back with ye.â€



HEâ€™D CHOSEN â€œLove thy neighbor as thyselfâ€ as the text for his first sermon. â€œAn oldie but a goodie,â€ as heâ€™d told Brianna, causing her to fizz slightly. And having heard at least a hundred variations on that theme, he was reasonably sure of having sufficient material to go on for the requisite thirty or forty minutes.

A standard church service was a great deal longerâ€”several readings of psalms, discussion of the lesson of the day, intercessions for members of the congregationâ€”but his voice wouldnâ€™t take that yet. He was going to have to work up to the full-bore service, which could easily run three hours. Heâ€™d arrange with Tom Christie, who was an elder, to do the readings and the earliest parayers, to start with. Then theyâ€™d see how things went.

Brianna was sitting modestly off to one side now, watching himâ€”not like Jackie Kennedy, thank God, but with a hidden smile that warmed her eyes whenever he met her gaze.

Heâ€™d brought notes, in case he should dry up or inspiration fail, but found that he didnâ€™t need them. Heâ€™d had a momentâ€™s breathlessness, when Tom Christie, who had read the lesson, snapped shut his Bible and looked significantly at himâ€”but once launched, he felt quite at home; it was a lot like lecturing at university, though God knew the congregation was more attentive by far than his university students usually were. They didnâ€™t interrupt with questions or argue with him, eitherâ€”at least not while he was talking.

He was intensely conscious for the first few moments of his surroundings: the faint fug of bodies and last nightâ€™s fried onions in the air, the scuffed boards of the floor, scrubbed and smelling of lye soap, and the close press of people, ranged on benches, but so many that they crammed into every bit of standing space, as well. Within a few minutes, though, he lost all sense of anything beyond the faces in front of him.

Allan Christie hadnâ€™t exaggerated; everyone had come. It was nearly as crowded as it had been during his last public appearance, presiding at old Mrs. Wilsonâ€™s untimely resurrection.

He wondered how much that occasion had to do with his present popularity. A few people were watching him covertly, with a faint air of expectation, as though he might turn water into wine for an encore, but for the most part, they appeared satisfied with the preaching. His voice was hoarse, but loud enough, thank God.

He believed in what he was saying; after the start he found himself talking more easily, and without the need of concentrating on his speech was able to glance from one person to another, making it seem he spoke to each one personallyâ€”meanwhile making fleeting observations in the back of his mind.

Marsali and Fergus hadnâ€™t comeâ€”no surprise thereâ€”but Germain was present; he sat with Jem and Aidan McCallum next to Brianna. All three boys had poked each other excitedly and pointed at him when he began to speak, but Brianna had quelled this behavior with some muttered threat of sufficient force to reduce them to simple squirming. Aidanâ€™s mother sat on his other side, looking at Roger with a sort of open adoration that made him uneasy.

The Christies had the place of honor in the center of the first bench: Malva Christie, demure in a lacy cap, her brother sitting protectively on one side, her father on the other, apparently unaware of the occasional looks shot her way by some of the young men.

Rather to Rogerâ€™s surprise, Jamie and Claire had come, as well, though they stood at the very back. His father-in-law was calmly impassive, but Claireâ€™s face was an open book; she clearly found the proceedings amusing.

â€œ. . . and if we are truly considering the love of Christ as it is . . .â€ It was instinct, honed by innumerable lectures, that made him aware that something was amiss. There was some slight disturbance in the far corner, where several half-grown lads had congregated. A couple of the numerous McAfee boys, and Jacky Lachlan, widely known as a limb of Satan.

No more than a nudge, the glint of an eye, some sense of subterranean excitement. But he sensed it, and kept glancing back at that corner with a narrowed eye, in hopes of keeping them subdued. And so happened to be looking when the serpent slithered out between Mrs. Crombieâ€™s shoes. It was a largish king snake, brightly striped with red, yellow, and black, and it seemed fairly calm, all things considered.

â€œNow, ye may say, â€˜Whoâ€™s my neighbor, then?â€™ And a good question, coming to live in a place where half the folk ye meet are strangersâ€”and plenty of them more than a bit strange, too.â€

A titter of appreciation ran through the congregation at that. The snake was casting about in a leisurely sort of way, head raised and tongue flickering with interest as it tested the air. It must be a tame snake; it wasnâ€™t bothered by the crush of people.

The reverse was not true; snakes were rare in Scotland, and most of the immigrants were nervous of them. Beyond the natural association with the devil, most folk couldnâ€™t or wouldnâ€™t distinguish a poison snake from any other, since the only Scottish snake, the adder, was venomous. Theyâ€™d have fits, Roger thought grimly, were they to look down and see what was gliding silently along the floorboards by their feet.

A strangled giggle, cut short, rose from the corner of guilty parties, and several heads in the congregation turned, uttering a censorious â€œShoosh!â€ in unison.

â€œ. . . when I was hungry, ye gave me to eat; when I was thirsty, ye gave me to drink. And who dâ€™ye ken here who would ever turn away even . . . even a Sassenach, say, who came to your door hungry?â€

A ripple of amusement, and slightly scandalized glances at Claire, who was rather pink, but with suppressed laughter, he thought, not offense.

A quick glance down; the snake, having paused for a rest, was on the move again, snooving its way gently round the end of a bench. A sudden movement caught Rogerâ€™s eye; Jamie had seen the snake, and jerked. Now he was standing rigid, eyeing it as though it were a bomb.

Roger had been sending up brief prayers, in the interstices of his sermon, suggesting that heavenly benevolence might see fit to shoo the snake quietly out the open door at the back. He intensified these prayers, at the same time unobtrusively unbuttoning his coat to allow for freer action.

If the damned thing came toward the front of the room instead of the back, heâ€™d have to dive forward and try to catch it before it got out in full sight of everyone. That would cause a disturbance, but nothing to what might happen if . . .

â€œ. . . now yeâ€™ll have noticed what Jesus said, when He spoke to the Samaritan woman at the well . . .â€

The snake was still wrapped halfway round the bench leg, making up its mind. It was no more than three feet from his father-in-law. Jamie was watching it like a hawk, and a visible gloss of sweat had appeared on his brow. Roger was aware that his father-in-law had a fixed dislike of snakesâ€”and no wonder, given that a big rattler had nearly killed him three years before.

Too far now for Roger to reach the thing; there were three benches of bodies between him and the snake. Bree, who could have dealt with it, was right away on the far side of the room. No help for it, he decided, with an inward sigh of resignation. Heâ€™d have to stop the proceedings, and in a very calm voice, call upon someone dependableâ€”who? He cast hastily round, and spotted Ian Murray, who was within reach, thank God, to grasp the thing and take it out.

He was opening his mouth to do just this, in fact, when the snake, bored with the scenery in its view, slid rapidly round the bench and headed straight along the back row.

Rogerâ€™s eye was on the snake, so he was as surprised as anyoneâ€”including the snake, no doubtâ€”when Jamie suddenly stooped and snatched it from the floor, whipping the startled serpent under his plaid.

Jamie was a large man, and the stir of his movement made several people look over their shoulders to see what had happened. He shifted, coughed, and endeavored to look passionately interested in Rogerâ€™s sermon. Seeing that there was nothing to look at, everyone turned back, settling themselves more comfortably.

â€œ. . . Now, we come across the Samaritans again, do we not, in the story of the Good Samaritan? Yeâ€™ll most of ye ken that one, but for the weans who may not have heard it yetâ€”â€ Roger smiled at Jem, Germain, and Aidan, who all wriggled like worms and made small, ecstatic squeaks at the thrill of being singled out.

From the corner of his eye, he could see Jamie, standing frozen and pale as his best linen sark. Something was moving about inside said sark, and the barest hint of bright scales showed in his clenched handâ€”the snake was evidently trying to escape up his arm, being restrained from popping through the neck of the shirt only by Jamieâ€™s desperate grip on its tail.

Jamie was sweating badly; so was Roger. He saw Brianna frown a little at him.

â€œ. . . and so the Samaritan told the innkeeper to mind the poor fellow, bind up his wounds, and feed him, and heâ€™d stop to settle the account on his way back from his business. So . . .â€

Roger saw Claire lean close to Jamie, whispering something. His father-in-law shook his head. At a guess, Claire had noticed the snakeâ€”she could scarcely fail toâ€”and was urging Jamie to go outside with it, but Jamie was nobly refusing, not wanting to further disrupt the sermon, as he couldnâ€™t go out without pushing past a number of other standees.

Roger paused to wipe his face with the large handkerchief Brianna had provided for the purpose, and under cover of this, saw Claire reach into the slit of her skirt and draw out a large calico pocket.

She appeared to be arguing with Jamie in a whisper; he was shaking his head, looking like the Spartan with the fox at his vitals.

Then the snakeâ€™s head appeared suddenly under Jamieâ€™s chin, tongue flicking, and Jamieâ€™s eyes went wide. Claire stood instantly on tiptoe, seized it by the neck, and whipping the astonished reptile out of her husbandâ€™s shirt like a length of rope, crammed the writhing ball headfirst into her pocket and jerked shut the drawstring.

â€œPraise the Lord!â€ Roger blurted, to which the congregation obligingly chorused â€œAmen!â€ though looking a little puzzled at the interjection.

The man next to Claire, who had witnessed this rapid sequence of events, stared at her bug-eyed. She stuffed the pocketâ€”now heaving with marked agitationâ€”back into her skirt, dropped her shawl over it, and giving the gentleman beside her a â€œWhat are you looking at, mate?â€ sort of stare, faced front and adopted a look of pious concentration.

Roger made it somehow to the end, sufficiently relieved at having the snake in custody that even leading the final hymnâ€”an interminable back-and-forth â€œline hymnâ€ in which he was obliged to chant each line, this echoed by the congregationâ€”didnâ€™t disconcert him too much, though he had almost no voice left and what there was creaked like an unoiled hinge.

His shirt was clinging to him and the cool air outside was a balm as he stood shaking hands, bowing, accepting the kind words of his flock.

â€œA grand sermon, Mr. MacKenzie, grand!â€ Mrs. Gwilty assured him. She nudged the wizened gentleman who accompanied her, who might be either her husband or her father-in-law. â€œWas it no the grand sermon, then, Mr. Gwilty?â€

â€œMmphm,â€ said the wizened gentleman judiciously. â€œNo bad, no bad. Bit short, and ye left out the fine story aboot the harlot, but nay doot yeâ€™ll get the way of it in time.â€

â€œNay doubt,â€ Roger said, nodding and smiling, wondering, What harlot? â€œThank ye for coming.â€

â€œOh, wouldna have missed it for the world,â€ the next lady informed him. â€œThough the singing wasna quite what one might have hoped for, was it?â€

â€œNo, Iâ€™m afraid not. Perhaps next timeâ€”â€

â€œI never did care for Psalm 109, itâ€™s that dreary. Next time, perhaps yeâ€™ll give us one oâ€™ the mair sprightly ones, aye?â€

â€œAye, I expectâ€”â€

â€œDaddyDaddyDaddy!â€ Jem cannoned into his legs, clutching him affectionately round the thighs and nearly knocking him over.

â€œNice job,â€ said Brianna, looking amused. â€œWhat was going on in the back of the room? You kept looking back there, but I couldnâ€™t see anything, andâ€”â€

â€œFine sermon, sir, fine sermon!â€ The older Mr. Ogilvie bowed to him, then walked off, his wifeâ€™s hand in his arm, saying to her, â€œThe puir lad canna carry a tune in his shoe, but the preaching wasna sae bad, all things considered.â€

Germain and Aidan joined Jemmy, all trying to hug him at once, and he did his best to encompass them, smile at everyone, and nod agreeably to suggestions that he speak louder, preach in the Gaelic, refrain from Latin (what Latin?) and Popish references, try to look more sober, try to look happier, try not to twitch, and put in more stories.

Jamie came out, and gravely shook his hand.

â€œVerra nice,â€ he said.

â€œThanks.â€ Roger struggled to find words. â€œYouâ€”well. Thanks,â€ he repeated.

â€œGreater love hath no man,â€ Claire observed, smiling at him from behind Jamieâ€™s elbow. The wind lifted her shawl, and he could see the side of her skirt moving oddly.

Jamie made a small amused sound.

â€œMmphm. Ye might drop by, maybe, and have a word wiâ€™ Rab McAfee and Isaiah Lachlanâ€”perhaps a short sermon on the text, â€˜He who loveth his son chasteneth him betimes?â€™â€

â€œMcAfee and Lachlan. Aye, Iâ€™ll do that.â€ Or perhaps heâ€™d just get the McAfees and Jacky Lachlan alone and see to the chastening himself.

He saw off the last of the congregation, took his leave of Tom Christie and his family with thanks, and headed for home and luncheon, his own family in tow. Normally, there would be another service in the afternoon, but he wasnâ€™t up to that yet.

Old Mrs. Abernathy was a little way before them on the path, being assisted by her friend, the slightly less-ancient Mrs. Coinneach.

â€œA nice-looking lad,â€ Mrs. Abernathy was remarking, her cracked old voice floating back on the crisp fall air. â€œBut nervous, och! Sweating rivers, did ye see?â€

â€œAye, well, shy, I suppose,â€ Mrs. Coinneach replied comfortably. â€œI expect heâ€™ll settle, though, in time.â€



ROGER LAY IN BED, savoring the lingering sense of the dayâ€™s accomplishments, the relief of disasters averted, and the sight of his wife, the light from the embers glowing through the thin linen of her shift as she knelt by the hearth, touching her skin and the ends of her hair with light, so that she looked illuminated from within.

The fire banked for the night, she rose and peered at Jemmy, curled up in his trundle and looking deceptively angelic, before coming to bed.

â€œYou look contemplative,â€ she said, smiling as she climbed onto the mattress. â€œWhat are you thinking about?â€

â€œTrying to think what on earth I might have said that Mr. MacNeill could possibly have thought was Latin, let alone a Catholic reference,â€ he replied, companionably making room for her.

â€œYou didnâ€™t start singing â€˜Ave Mariaâ€™ or anything,â€ she assured him. â€œI would have noticed.â€

â€œMm,â€ he said, and coughed. â€œDonâ€™t mention the singing, aye?â€

â€œItâ€™ll get better,â€ she said firmly, and turned, pushing and squirming, to make a nest for herself. The mattress was stuffed with wool, much more comfortableâ€”and a hell of a lot quieterâ€”than corn shucks, but very prone to lumps and odd hollows.

â€œAye, maybe,â€ he said, though thinking, Maybe. But it will never be what it was. No point in thinking of that, though; heâ€™d grieved as much as he meant to. It was time to make the best of things and get on.

Comfortable at last, she turned to him, sighing in contentment as her body seemed to melt momentarily and remold itself around himâ€”one of her many small, miraculous talents. She had put her hair in a thick plait for sleeping, and he ran his hand down its length, recalling the snake with a brief shudder. He wondered what Claire had done with it. Likely set it free in her garden to eat mice, pragmatist that she was.

â€œDid you figure out which harlot story it was you left out?â€ Brianna murmured, moving her hips against his in a casual but definitely nonaccidental sort of way.

â€œNo. There are a terrible lot of harlots in the Bible.â€ He took the tip of her ear very gently between his teeth and she drew a deep, sudden breath.

â€œWhassa harlot?â€ said a small, sleepy voice from the trundle.

â€œGo to sleep, mateâ€”Iâ€™ll tell ye in the morning,â€ Roger called, and slid a hand down over Briannaâ€™s very round, very solid, very warm hip.

Jemmy would almost certainly be asleep in seconds, but they contented themselves with small, secret touches beneath the bedclothes, waiting to be sure he was soundly asleep. He slept like the dead, once firmly in dreamland, but had more than once roused from the drowsy foreshore at very awkward moments, disturbed by his parentsâ€™ unseemly noises.

â€œIs it like you thought it would be?â€ Bree asked, putting a thoughtful thumb on his nipple and rotating it.

â€œIs whatâ€”oh, the preaching. Well, bar the snake . . .â€

â€œNot just thatâ€”the whole thing. Do you think . . .â€ Her eyes searched his, and he tried to keep his mind on what she was saying, rather than what she was doing.

â€œAh . . .â€ His hand clamped over hers, and he took a deep breath. â€œYeah. Ye mean am I still sure? I am; I wouldna have done such a thing if I werenâ€™t.â€

â€œDadâ€”Daddyâ€”always said it was a great blessing to have a calling, to know that you were meant to be something in particular. Do you think youâ€™ve always had aâ€”a calling?â€

â€œWell, for a time, I had the fixed notion that I was meant to be a deep-sea diver,â€ he said. â€œDonâ€™t laugh; I mean it. What about you?â€

â€œMe?â€ She looked surprised, then pursed her lips, thinking. â€œWell, I went to a Catholic school, so we were all urged to think about becoming priests or nunsâ€”but I was pretty sure I didnâ€™t have a religious vocation.â€

â€œThank God,â€ he said, with a fervency that made her laugh.

â€œAnd then for quite a while, I thought I should be a historianâ€”that I wanted to be one. And it was interesting,â€ she said slowly. â€œI could do it. Butâ€”what I really wanted was to build things. To make things.â€ She pulled her hand out from under his and waggled her fingers, long and graceful. â€œBut I donâ€™t know that thatâ€™s a calling, really.â€

â€œDo ye not think motherhood is a calling, of sorts?â€ He was on delicate ground here. She was several days late, but neither of them had mentioned itâ€”or was going to, yet.

She cast a quick glance over her shoulder at the trundle bed, and made a small grimace, whose import he couldnâ€™t read.

â€œCan you call something thatâ€™s accidental for most people a calling?â€ she asked. â€œI donâ€™t mean it isnâ€™t importantâ€”but shouldnâ€™t there be some choice involved?â€

Choice. Well, Jem had been thoroughly an accident, but this oneâ€”if there was oneâ€”theyâ€™d chosen, all right.

â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ He smoothed the long rope of her braid against her spine, and she pressed closer in reflex. He thought she felt somehow riper than usual; something about the feel of her breasts. Softer. Bigger.

â€œJemâ€™s asleep,â€ she said softly, and he heard the surprisingly deep, slow breathing from the trundle. She put her hand back on his chest, the other somewhat lower.

A little later, drifting toward dreamland himself, he heard her say something, and tried to rouse enough to ask her what it was, but managed only a small interrogative â€œMm?â€

â€œIâ€™ve always thought I do have a calling,â€ she repeated, looking upward at the shadows in the beamed ceiling. â€œSomething I was meant to do. But I donâ€™t know yet what it is.â€

â€œWell, ye definitely werenâ€™t meant to be a nun,â€ he said drowsily. â€œBeyond thatâ€”I couldna say.â€



THE MANâ€™S FACE was in darkness. He saw an eye, a wet shine, and his heart beat in fear. The bodhrana were talking.

There was wood in his hand, a tipper, a clubâ€”it seemed to change in size, immense, yet he handled it lightly, part of his hand, it beat the drumhead, beat in the head of the man whose eyes turned toward him, shining with terror.

Some animal was with him, something large and half-seen, brushing eager past his thighs into the dark, urgent for blood, and he after it, hunting.

The club came down, and down, and upanddown, upanddown, upanddown with the waggle of his wrist, the bodhran live and talking in his bones, the thud that shivered through his arm, a skull breaking inward with a wet, soft sound.

Joined for that instant, joined closer than man and wife, hearts one, terror and bloodlust both yielding to that soft, wet thud and the empty night. The body fell, and he felt it go away from him, a rending loss, felt earth and pine needles rough against his cheek as he fell.

The eyes shone wet and empty, and the face slack-lipped in firelight, one he knew, but he knew not the name of the dead, and the animal was breathing in the night behind him, hot breath on his nape. Everything was burning: grass, trees, sky.

The bodhrana were talking in his bones, but he could not make it out what they said, and he beat the ground, the soft limp body, the burning tree in a rage that made sparks fly, to make the drums leave his blood, speak clearly. Then the tipper flew free, his hand struck the tree and burst into flame.

He woke with his hand on fire, gasping. He brought his knuckles to his mouth by instinct, tasting silver blood. His heart was hammering so that he could scarcely breathe, and he fought the notion, trying to slow his heart, keep breathing, keep panic at bay, stop his throat closing up and strangling him.

The pain in his hand helped, distracting him from the thought of suffocation. Heâ€™d thrown a punch in his sleep, and hit the log wall of the cabin square. Jesus, it felt like his knuckles had burst. He pressed the heel of his other hand against them, hard, gritting his teeth.

Rolled onto his side and saw the wet shine of eyes in the ghost of firelight and would have screamed, if heâ€™d had any breath.

â€œAre you all right, Roger?â€ Brianna whispered, voice urgent. Her hand touched his shoulder, his back, the curve of his brow, quickly seeking injury.

â€œYeah,â€ he said, fighting for breath. â€œBad . . . dream.â€ He wasnâ€™t dreaming of suffocation; his chest was tight, every breath a conscious effort.

She threw back the covers and rose in a rustle of sheets, pulling him up.

â€œSit up,â€ she said, low-voiced. â€œWake all the way up. Breathe slow; Iâ€™ll make you some teaâ€”well, something hot, at least.â€

He hadnâ€™t any breath to protest. The scar on his throat was a vise. The first agony in his hand had subsided; now it began to throb in time to his heartâ€”fine, that was all he needed. He fought back the dream, the sense of drums beating in his bones, and in the struggle, found his breath start to ease. By the time Brianna brought him a mug of hot water poured over something foul-smelling, he was breathing almost normally.

He declined to drink whatever it was, whereupon she thriftily used it to bathe his scraped knuckles instead.

â€œDo you want to tell me about the dream?â€ She was heavy-eyed, still yearning for sleep, but willing to listen.

He hesitated, but he could feel the dream hovering in the night-still air, just behind him; to keep silent and lie back in the dark was to invite its return. And perhaps she should know what the dream had told him.

â€œIt was a muddle, but to do with the fightâ€”when we went to bring Claire back. The manâ€”the one I killedâ€”â€ The word stuck in his throat like a bur, but he got it out. â€œI was smashing in his head, and he fell, and I saw his face again. And suddenly I realized Iâ€™d seen him before; Iâ€”I know who he was.â€ The faint horror of knowing the man showed in his voice, and her heavy lashes rose, her eyes suddenly alert.

Her hand covered his injured knuckles, lightly, questioning.

â€œDo ye recall a wretched little thieftaker named Harley Boble? We met him, just the once, at the Gathering at Mount Helicon.â€

â€œI remember. Him? Youâ€™re sure? It was dark, you said, and all confusedâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™m sure. I didnâ€™t know, when I hit him, but I saw his face when he fellâ€”the grass was on fire, I saw it clearlyâ€”and I saw it again, just now, in the dream, and the name was in my mind when I woke up.â€ He flexed his hand slowly, grimacing. â€œIt seems a lot worse, somehow, to kill someone ye know.â€ And the knowledge of having killed a stranger was quite bad enough. It obliged him to think of himself as one capable of murder.

â€œWell, you didnâ€™t know him, at the time,â€ she pointed out. â€œDidnâ€™t recognize him, I mean.â€

â€œNo, thatâ€™s true.â€ It was, but didnâ€™t help. The fire was smoored for the night, and the room was chilly; he noticed the gooseflesh on her bare forearms, the gold hairs rising. â€œYouâ€™re cold; letâ€™s go back to bed.â€

The bed still held a faint warmth, and it was unutterable comfort to have her curl close to his back, the heat of her body penetrating his bone-deep chill. His hand still throbbed, but the pain had dulled to a negligible ache. Her arm settled firmly round him, a loose fist curled under his chin. He bent his head to kiss her own knuckles, smooth and hard and round, felt her warm breath on his neck, and had the oddest momentary recollection of the animal in his dream.

â€œBree . . . I did mean to kill him.â€

â€œI know,â€ she said softly, and tightened her arm around him, as though to save him falling.

FROGGY GOES A-COURTING




From Lord John Grey

Mount Josiah Plantation

My dear Friend,

I write in some Perturbation of Spirit.

You will recall Mr. Josiah Quincy, I am sure. I should not have provided him with a Letter of Introduction to you, had I had any Notion of the eventual Outcome of his Efforts. For I am sure that it is by his Action that your Name is associated with the so-called Committee of Correspondence in North Carolina. A Friend, knowing of my Acquaintance with you, showed me a Missive yesterday, purporting to originate from this Body, and containing a List of its presumed Recipients. Your Name was among these, and the Sight of it in such Company caused me such Concern as to compel me to write at once to inform you of the Matter.

I should have burned the Missive at once, was it not apparent that it was only one of several Copies. The Others are doubtless in transit through various of the Colonies. You must move at once to disassociate yourself from any such Body, and take Pains that your Name does not appear in Future in such Contexts.

For be warned: the Mail is not safe. I have received more than one official Documentâ€”even some bearing royal Seals!â€”that not only show Signs of having been opened, but that in some Cases are blatantly marked with the Initials or Signatures of those Men who have intercepted and inspected them. Such Inspection may be imposed either by Whig or Tory, there is no telling, and I hear that Governor Martin himself is now having his Mail directed to his Brother in New York, thus to be brought to him by private Messengerâ€”one of these was a recent Guest at my tableâ€”as he cannot trust its secure Delivery within North Carolina.

I can only hope that no incriminating Document containing your Name falls into the Hands of Persons with the Power to arrest or instigate other Proceedings against the Speakers of such Sedition as appears in it. I apologize most sincerely, if my Inadvertence in introducing Mr. Quincy should in any way have endangered or inconvenienced you, and I will, I assure you, lend my every Effort to correct the Situation so far as may be in my Power.

Meanwhile, I offer you the Services of Mr. Higgins, should you require secure Delivery of any Document, not merely Letters addressed to myself. He is completely trustworthy, and I will send him regularly to you, in case you may require him.

Still, I am in Hopes that the Situation overall may yet be retrieved. I think those Hotheads who urge Rebellion must be for the most Part ignorant of the Nature of War, or surely they would not risk its Terrors and Hardships, nor yet think lightly of shedding Blood or the Sacrifice of their own Lives for the sake of so Small a Disagreement with their Parent.

Feeling in London at present is that the Matter will amount to no more than â€œa few bloody Noses,â€ as Lord North puts it, and I trust it may be so.

This News has also a personal Aspect; my son William has purchased a Lieutenantâ€™s Commission, and will join his Regiment almost immediately. I am of course proud of himâ€”and yet, knowing the Dangers and Hardships of a Soldierâ€™s Life, I confess that I should have preferred him to adopt another Course, either devoting himself to the Conduct of his considerable Estates, or, if he felt this too tame a Life, perhaps entering the Realm of Politics or Commerceâ€”for he has much natural Ability to add to the Power of his Resources, and might well achieve some Influence in such Spheres.

Those Resources are of course still within my Control, until William shall attain his Majority. But I could not gainsay him, so exigent was his Desireâ€”and so vivid my Memories of myself at that Age, and my Determination to serve. It may be that he will have his Fill of Soldiering quickly, and adopt another Course. And I will admit that the military Life has many Virtues to recommend it, stern as these Virtues may sometimes be.

On a less alarming Noteâ€”

I find myself returned unexpectedly to the Role of Diplomat. Not, I hasten to add, on behalf of His Majesty, but rather on behalf of Robert Higgins, who begs that I will employ what small Influence I possess in advancing his Prospects for Marriage.

I have found Mr. Higgins a good and faithful Servant, and am pleased to offer what Assistance I may; I hope you will find yourself similarly disposed, for as you will see, your Advice and Counsel is most urgently desired and, in fact, quite indispensable.

There is some small Delicacy involved in this Matter, and upon this Point, I would beg your Consideration; your Discretion I of course trust implicitly. It would appear that Mr. Higgins has formed some Attachment to two young Ladies, both resident on Fraserâ€™s Ridge. I have pointed out to him the Difficulty of fighting on two Fronts, as it were, and advised him to concentrate his Forces so as to provide the best chance of Success in his Attack upon a single Objectâ€”with, perhaps, the Possibility of falling back to regroup, should his initial Essay fail.

The two Ladies in question are Miss Wemyss and Miss Christie, both possessed of Beauty and Charm in Abundance, according to Mr. Higgins, who is most eloquent in their Praises. Pressed to choose between them, Mr. Higgins protested that he could notâ€”but after some little Discussion on the matter, has at length settled upon Miss Wemyss as his first Choice.

This is a practical Decision, and the Reasons for his Choice concern not only the Ladyâ€™s undoubted Attractions, but a more mundane Consideration: viz, that the Lady and her Father are both Bond Servants, indentured to you. I am, by Reason of Mr. Higginsâ€™s devoted Service, offering to purchase both Indentures, should this be agreeable to you, upon Miss Wemyssâ€™s Agreement to wed Mr. Higgins.

I should not wish to deprive you thus of two valued Servants, but Mr. Higgins feels that Miss Wemyss will not wish to leave her Father. By the same Token, he hopes that my offering to free Father and Daughter from Servitude (for I have agreed that I would do so, provided that Mr. Higginsâ€™s Employment with me shall continue) would be sufficient Inducement to overcome any Objections which Mr. Wemyss might present on Account of Mr. Higginsâ€™s lack of Connexions and personal Property, or such other small Impediments to the Marriage as might present themselves.

I collect that Miss Christie, while equally attractive, has a Father who may be somewhat more difficult of Persuasion, and her social Situation is somewhat higher than that of Miss Wemyss. Still, should Miss Wemyss or her father decline Mr. Higginsâ€™s Offer, I will do my Best, with your Assistance, to devise some Inducement that might appeal to Mr. Christie.

What think you of this Plan of Attack? I beg you to consider the Prospects carefully, and if you feel that the Proposal might be received favorably, to broach the Matter to Mr. Wemyss and his Daughterâ€”if possible, with such Discretion as not to prejudice a secondary Expedition, should that prove necessary.

Mr. Higgins is most sensible of his inferior Position, viewed as a potential Groom, and thus most conscious of the Favor he seeks, as is





Your most humble and obedient Servant,





John Grey

â€œ. . . such other small Impediments to the Marriage as might present themselves,â€ I read, over Jamieâ€™s shoulder. â€œLike being a convicted murderer with a brand on his cheek, no family, and no money, do you think he means?â€

â€œAye, like that,â€ Jamie agreed, straightening out the sheets of paper and tapping the edges straight. He was clearly amused by Lord Johnâ€™s letter, but his brows had drawn together, though I didnâ€™t know whether this was a sign of concern over Lord Johnâ€™s news about Willie, or merely concentration on the delicate question of Bobby Higginsâ€™s proposal.

The latter, evidently, for he glanced upward, toward the room that Lizzie and her father shared. No sound of movement came through the ceiling, though Iâ€™d seen Joseph go upstairs a little earlier.

â€œAsleep?â€ Jamie asked, eyebrows raised. He looked involuntarily at the window. It was mid-afternoon, and the yard was cheerfully awash in mellow light.

â€œCommon symptom of depression,â€ I said, with a small shrug. Mr. Wemyss had taken the dissolution of Lizzieâ€™s betrothal hardâ€”much more so than had his daughter. Frail-looking to begin with, he had noticeably lost weight, and had withdrawn into himself, speaking only when spoken to, and becoming increasingly hard to rouse from sleep in the mornings.

Jamie struggled momentarily with the concept of depression, then dismissed it with a brief shake of the head. He tapped the stiff fingers of his right hand thoughtfully on the table.

â€œWhat dâ€™ye think, Sassenach?â€

â€œBobbyâ€™s a lovely young man,â€ I said dubiously. â€œAnd Lizzie obviously likes him.â€

â€œAnd if the Wemysses were still indentured, Bobbyâ€™s proposal would likely have some appeal,â€ Jamie agreed. â€œBut theyâ€™re not.â€ He had given Joseph Wemyss his papers of indenture some years earlier, and Brianna had hastily freed Lizzie from her own bond nearly as soon as it was made. That was not a matter of public knowledge, though, since Josephâ€™s presumed status as a bondsman protected him from service in the militia. Likewise, as a bondmaid, Lizzie benefited from Jamieâ€™s overt protection, as she was considered his property; no one would dare to trouble her or treat her with open disrespect.

â€œPerhaps heâ€™d be willing to engage them as paid servants,â€ I suggested. â€œTheir combined salary would likely be a good deal less than the price of two indentures.â€ We paid Joseph, but his salary was only three pounds a year, though with room, board, and clothing supplied.

â€œI will suggest as much,â€ Jamie said, but with an air of dubiousness. â€œBut Iâ€™ll have to speak with Joseph.â€ He glanced upward once more, and shook his head.

â€œSpeaking of Malva . . .â€ I said, glancing across the hall and lowering my voice. She was in the surgery, straining liquid from the bowls of mold that provided our supply of penicillin. I had promised to send more to Mrs. Sylvie, with a syringe; I hoped she would use it.

â€œDo you think Tom Christie would be receptive, if Joseph isnâ€™t? I think both girls are rather partial to Bobby.â€

Jamie made a mildly derisive noise at the thought.

â€œTom Christie marry his daughter to a murderer, and a penniless murderer at that? John Grey doesna ken the man at all, or he wouldna be suggesting such a thing. Christieâ€™s proud as Nebuchadnezzar, if not more so.â€

â€œOh, as proud as all that, is he?â€ I said, amused despite myself. â€œWho do you think he would find suitable, here in the wilderness?â€

Jamie lifted one shoulder in a shrug.

â€œHe hasna honored me with his confidences in the matter,â€ he said dryly. â€œThough he doesna let his daughter walk out wiâ€™ any of the young lads hereabouts; I imagine none seems worthy to him. I shouldna be surprised at all, if he were to contrive some means of sending her to Edenton or New Bern to make a match, and he can contrive a way to do it. Roger Mac says heâ€™s mentioned such a course.â€

â€œReally? Heâ€™s getting quite thick with Roger these days, isnâ€™t he?â€

A reluctant smile crossed his face at that.

â€œAye, well. Roger Mac takes the welfare of his flock to heartâ€”with an eye to his own, nay doubt.â€

â€œWhatever do you mean by that?â€

He eyed me for a moment, evidently judging my capacity for keeping secrets.

â€œMmphm. Well, ye mustna mention it to Brianna, but Roger Mac has it in mind to make a match between Tom Christie and Amy McCallum.â€

I blinked, but then considered. It wasnâ€™t really a bad idea, though not one that would have occurred to me. Granted, Tom was likely more than twenty-five years older than Amy McCallum, but he was still healthy and strong enough to provide for her and her sons. And she plainly needed a provider. Whether she and Malva could share a house was another question; Malva had had the running of her fatherâ€™s house since she could manage it. She was amiable, certainly, but I rather thought she had as much pride as her father, and wouldnâ€™t take kindly to being supplanted.

â€œMmm,â€ I said dubiously. â€œPerhaps. What do you mean about Rogerâ€™s own welfare, though?â€

Jamie raised one thick eyebrow.

â€œHave ye not seen the way the widow McCallum looks at him?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said, taken aback. â€œHave you?â€

He nodded.

â€œI have, and so has Brianna. She bides her time for the momentâ€”but mark my words, Sassenach: if wee Roger doesna see the widow safely marrit soon, heâ€™ll find hell nay hotter than his own hearth.â€

â€œOh, now. Roger isnâ€™t looking back at Mrs. McCallum, is he?â€ I demanded.

â€œNo, he is not,â€ Jamie said judiciously, â€œand thatâ€™s why heâ€™s still in possession of his balls. But if ye think my daughter is one to standâ€”â€

We had been speaking in low voices and, at the sound of the surgery door opening, stopped abruptly. Malva poked her head into the study, her cheeks flushed and wispy tendrils of dark hair floating round her face. She looked like a Dresden figurine, despite the stains on her apron, and I saw Jamie smile at her look of eager freshness.

â€œPlease, Mrs. Fraser, Iâ€™ve strained off all the liquid and bottled itâ€”ye did say that we must feed the slops left over to the pig at once . . . did ye mean the big white sow that lives under the house?â€ She looked rather doubtful at the prospect, and no wonder.

â€œIâ€™ll come and do it,â€ I said, rising. â€œThank you, dear. You go along to the kitchen and ask Mrs. Bug for a bit of bread and honey before you go home, why donâ€™t you?â€

She curtsied and went off toward the kitchen; I could hear Young Ianâ€™s voice, teasing Mrs. Bug, and saw Malva stop for an instant to pat her cap, twirl a wisp of hair around her finger to make it curl against her cheek, and straighten her slender back before going in.

â€œWell, Tom Christie may propose all he likes,â€ I murmured to Jamie, who had come out into the hall with me and seen her go, â€œbut yours isnâ€™t the only daughter with a mind of her own and strong opinions.â€

He gave a small, dismissive grunt and went back to his study, while I continued across the hall, to find a large basin of soggy garbage, the remnants of the latest batch of penicillin-making, neatly collected and standing on the counter.

Opening the window at the side of the house, I peered out and down. Four feet below was the mound of dirt that marked the white sowâ€™s den beneath the foundation.

â€œPig?â€ I said, leaning out. â€œAre you at home?â€ The chestnuts were ripe and falling from the trees; she might well be out in the wood, gorging herself on chestnut mast. But no; there were hoofmarks in the soft soil, leading in, and the sound of stertorous breathing was audible below.

â€œPig!â€ I said, louder and more peremptorily. Hearing the stirring and scraping of an enormous bulk beneath the floorboards, I leaned out and dropped the wooden basin neatly into the soft dirt, spilling only a little of its contents.

The thump of its landing was followed at once by the protrusion of an immense white-bristled head, equipped with a large and snuffling pink nose, and followed by shoulders the width of a hogshead of tobacco. With eager grunts, the rest of the sowâ€™s great body followed, and she fell upon the treat at once, curly tail coiled tightly with delight.

â€œYes, well, just you remember whoâ€™s the source from whom all blessing flows,â€ I told her, and withdrew, taking pains to shut the window. The sill showed considerable splintering and gougingâ€”the result of leaving the slop basin too long on the counter; the sow was an impatient sort, who was quite willing to try to come into the house and claim her due, if it wasnâ€™t forthcoming promptly enough to suit.

While partly occupied with the pig, my mind had not yet left the question of Bobby Higginsâ€™s proposal, with all its potential complications. To say nothing of Malva. Granted, she was undoubtedly sensible of Bobbyâ€™s blue eyes; he was a very handsome young man. But she wasnâ€™t insensible to Young Ianâ€™s charms, either, less striking as they might be.

And what would Tom Christieâ€™s opinion of Ian as a son-in-law be, I wondered. He wasnâ€™t quite penniless; he had ten acres of mostly uncleared land, though no income to speak of. Were tribal tattoos more socially acceptable than a murdererâ€™s brand? Probablyâ€”but then, Bobby was a Protestant, while Ian was at least nominally Catholic.

Still, he was Jamieâ€™s nephewâ€”a fact that might cut both ways. Christie was intensely jealous of Jamie; I knew that. Would he see an alliance between his family and ours as a benefit, or as something to be avoided at all costs?

Of course, if Roger succeeded in getting him to marry Amy McCallum, that might distract his mind a bit. Brianna hadnâ€™t said anything to me about the widowâ€”but now that I thought back, I realized that the fact that she hadnâ€™t said anything might be an indication of suppressed feeling.

I could hear voices and laughter from the kitchen; obviously, everyone was having fun. I thought to go and join them, but glancing into Jamieâ€™s study, saw that he was standing by his desk, hands clasped behind him, looking down at Lord Johnâ€™s letter, a small frown of abstraction on his face.

His thoughts werenâ€™t with his daughter, I thought, with a small, queer pangâ€”but with his son.

I came into the study and put my arm round his back, leaning my head against his shoulder.

â€œHave you thought, perhaps, of trying to convince Lord John?â€ I said, a little hesitantly. â€œThat the Americans may possibly have a point, I meanâ€”convert him to your way of thinking.â€ Lord John himself would not be fighting in the coming conflict; Willie well might, and on the wrong side. Granted, fighting on either side was likely to be as dangerousâ€”but the fact remained that the Americans would win, and the only conceivable way of swaying Willie was through his putative father, whose opinions he respected.

Jamie snorted, but put an arm around me.

â€œJohn? Dâ€™ye recall what I told ye about Highlanders, when Arch Bug came to me wiâ€™ his wee ax?â€

â€œThey live by their oath; they will die by it, too.â€

I shivered a little, and pressed closer, finding some comfort in his solidness. He was right; I had seen it myself, that brutal tribal fealtyâ€”and yet it was so hard to grasp, even when I saw it right under my nose.

â€œI remember,â€ I said.

He nodded at the letter, his eyes still fixed on it.

â€œHe is the same. Not all Englishmen areâ€”but he is.â€ He looked down at me, ruefulness tinged with begrudging respect. â€œHe is the Kingâ€™s man. It wouldna matter if the Angel Gabriel appeared before him and told him what will pass; he wouldna abandon his oath.â€

â€œDo you think so?â€ I said, emboldened. â€œIâ€™m not so sure.â€

His brows went up in surprise, and I went on, hesitating as I groped for words.

â€œItâ€™sâ€”I do know what you mean; heâ€™s an honorable man. But thatâ€™s just it. I donâ€™t think he is sworn to the Kingâ€”not in the same way Columâ€™s men swore to him, nor the way your men from Lallybroch swore to you. What matters to himâ€”what heâ€™d sell his life forâ€”itâ€™s honor.â€

â€œWell, ayeâ€”it is,â€ he said slowly, brows knit in concentration. â€œBut for a soldier, such as he is, honor lies in his duty, no? And that comes from his fealty to the King, surely?â€

I straightened and rubbed a finger beneath my nose, trying to put into words what I thought.

â€œYes, but thatâ€™s not quite what I mean. Itâ€™s the idea that matters to him. He follows an ideal, not a man. Of all the people you know, he may be the only one who would understandâ€”this will be a war fought about ideals; maybe the first.â€

He closed one eye and regarded me quizzically out of the other.

â€œYeâ€™ve been talking to Roger Mac. Yeâ€™ll never have thought that on your own, Sassenach.â€

â€œI gather you have, too,â€ I said, not bothering to refute the implied insult. Besides, he was right. â€œSo you understand?â€

He made a small Scottish noise, indicating dubious agreement.

â€œI did ask him what about the Crusades, did he not think that was fought for an ideal? And he was obliged to admit that ideals were involved, at leastâ€”though even there he said it was money and politics, and I said it always was, and surely it would be now, as well. But, aye, I understand,â€ he added hastily, seeing my nostrils flare. â€œBut with regard to John Greyâ€”â€

â€œWith regard to John Grey,â€ I said, â€œyou do have a chance of convincing him, because heâ€™s both rational and idealistic. Youâ€™d have to convince him that honor doesnâ€™t lie in following the Kingâ€”but in the ideal of freedom. But itâ€™s possible.â€

He made another Scottish noise, this one deep-chested and filled with uneasy doubt. And finally, I realized.

â€œYou arenâ€™t doing it for the sake of ideals, are you? Not for the sake ofâ€”of liberty. Freedom, self-determination, all that.â€

He shook his head.

â€œNo,â€ he said softly. â€œNor yet for the sake of being on the winning sideâ€”for once. Though I expect that will be a novel experience.â€ He gave me a sudden rueful smile, and, caught by surprise, I laughed.

â€œWhy, then?â€ I asked, more gently.

â€œFor you,â€ he said without hesitation. â€œFor Brianna and the wee lad. For my family. For the future. And if that is not an ideal, Iâ€™ve never heard of one.â€



JAMIE DID HIS BEST in the office of ambassador, but the effect of Bobbyâ€™s brand proved insuperable. While admitting that Bobby was a nice young man, Mr. Wemyss was unable to countenance the notion of marrying his daughter to a murderer, no matter what the circumstances that had led to his conviction.

â€œFolk would take against him, sir, ye ken that fine,â€ he said, shaking his head in response to Jamieâ€™s arguments. â€œThey dinna stop to ask the why and wherefore, if a manâ€™s condemned. His eyeâ€”he did nothing, I am sure, to provoke such a savage attack. How could I expose my dear Elizabeth to the possibility of such reprisals? Even if she should escape herself, what of her fateâ€”and that of her childrenâ€”if he is knocked over in the street one day?â€ He wrung his hands at the thought.

â€œAnd if he should one day lose his Lordshipâ€™s patronage, he could not look for decent employment elsewhere, not with yon mark of shame upon his face. They would be beggared. I have been left in such straits myself, sirâ€”and would not for the world risk my daughterâ€™s sharing such a fate again.â€

Jamie rubbed a hand over his face.

â€œAye. I understand, Joseph. A pity, but I canna say as yeâ€™re wrong. For what the observation be worth, I dinna believe that Lord John would cast him off, though.â€

Mr. Wemyss merely shook his head, looking pale and unhappy.

â€œWell, then.â€ Jamie pushed himself back from his desk. â€œIâ€™ll have him in, and ye can give him your decision.â€ I rose, as well, and Mr. Wemyss sprang up in panic.

â€œOh, sir! Ye will not leave me alone with him!â€

â€œWell, I scarcely think heâ€™ll try to knock ye down or pull your nose, Joseph,â€ Jamie said mildly.

â€œNo,â€ Mr. Wemyss said dubiously. â€œNooo . . . I suppose not. But still, I should take it very kindly if you wouldâ€”would remain while I speak with him? And you, Mrs. Fraser?â€ He turned pleading eyes upon me. I looked at Jamie, who nodded in resignation.

â€œAll right,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™ll go and fetch him, then.â€



â€œI AM SORRY, SIR.â€ Joseph Wemyss was nearly as unhappy as Bobby Higgins. Small in stature and shy in manner, he was unaccustomed to conducting interviews, and kept glancing at Jamie for moral support, before returning his attention to his daughterâ€™s importunate suitor.

â€œI am sorry,â€ he repeated, meeting Bobbyâ€™s eyes with a sort of helpless sincerity. â€œI like ye, young man, and so does Elizabeth, I am sure. But her welfare, her happiness, is my responsibility. And I cannot think . . . I really do not suppose . . .â€

â€œI should be kind to her,â€ Bobby said anxiously. â€œYou know I should, zur. She should have a new gown once a year, and I should sell anything I have to keep her in shoes!â€ He, too, glanced at Jamie, presumably in hopes of reinforcement.

â€œIâ€™m sure Mr. Wemyss has the highest regard for your intentions, Bobby,â€ Jamie said as gently as possible. â€œBut heâ€™s right, aye? It is his duty to make the best match he can for wee Lizzie. And perhaps . . .â€

Bobby swallowed hard. He had groomed himself to the nines for this interview, and wore a starched neckcloth that threatened to choke him, with his livery coat, a pair of clean woolen breeches, and a pair of carefully preserved silk stockings, neatly darned in only a few places.

â€œI know I haâ€™nâ€™t got a great deal of money,â€ he said. â€œNor property. But I have got a good situation, zur! Lord John pays me ten pound a year, and has been so kind as to say I may build a small cottage on his grounds, and â€™til it is ready, we might have quarters in his house.â€

â€œAye, so ye said.â€ Mr. Wemyss looked increasingly wretched. He kept looking away from Bobby, perhaps in part from natural shyness and unwillingness to refuse him eye-to-eyeâ€”but also, I was sure, to avoid seeming to look at the brand upon his cheek.

The discussion went on for a bit, but to no effect, as Mr. Wemyss could not bring himself to tell Bobby the real reason for his refusal.

â€œIâ€”Iâ€”well, I will think further.â€ Mr. Wemyss, unable to bear the tension any longer, got abruptly to his feet and nearly ran out of the roomâ€”forcing himself to a stop at the door, though, to turn and say, â€œMind, I do not think I shall change my mind!â€ before disappearing.

Bobby looked after him, nonplused, then turned to Jamie.

â€œHave I hopes, zur? I know you will be honest.â€

It was a pathetic plea, and Jamie himself glanced away from those large blue eyes.

â€œI do not think so,â€ he said. It was said kindly, but definitely, and Bobby sagged a little. He had slicked down his wavy hair with water; now dried, tiny curls were popping up from the thick mass, and he looked absurdly like a newborn lamb that has just had its tail docked, shocked and dismayed.

â€œDoes sheâ€”do ye know, zur, or maâ€™amâ€â€”turning to meâ€”â€œare Miss Elizabethâ€™s affections given elsewhere? For if that was to be the case, sure I would bide. But if not . . .â€ He hesitated, glancing toward the door where Joseph had so abruptly disappeared.

â€œDâ€™ye think I might have some chance of overcoming her fatherâ€™s objections? Perhapsâ€”perhaps if I was to find some way of coming by a bit oâ€™ money . . . or if it was to be a question of religion . . .â€ He looked a little pale at this, but squared his shoulders resolutely. â€œIâ€”I think I should be willing to be baptized Romish and he required it. I meant to tell him so, but forgot. Would ye maybe say so to him, zur?â€

â€œAye . . . aye, I will,â€ Jamie said reluctantly. â€œYeâ€™ve quite made up your mind as itâ€™s Lizzie, then, have ye? Not Malva?â€

Bobby was taken back by that.

â€œWell, to be honest, zurâ€”Iâ€™m that fond of them both, Iâ€™m sure I should be happy with either one. Butâ€”well, truth to tell, I be mortal feared of Mr. Christie,â€ he confessed, blushing. â€œAnd I think he donâ€™t like you, zur, while Mr. Wemyss does. If you could . . . speak for me, zur? Please?â€

In the end, even Jamie was not proof against this guileless begging.

â€œIâ€™ll try,â€ he conceded. â€œBut I promise ye nothing, Bobby. How long will ye stay now, before ye go back to Lord John?â€

â€œHis Lordshipâ€™s given me a week for my wooing, zur,â€ Bobby said, looking much happier. â€œBut I suppose yeâ€™ll be going yourself tomorrow or next day?â€

Jamie looked surprised.

â€œGoing where?â€

Bobby looked surprised in turn.

â€œWhy . . . I donâ€™t rightly know, zur. But I thought you must.â€

After a bit more cross-talk, we succeeded in disentangling the tale. He had, it seemed, fallen in with a small group of travelers on the road, farmers driving a herd of pigs to market. Given the nature of pigs as traveling companions, he hadnâ€™t stayed with them for more than one night, but over supper, in the course of casual talk, had heard them make reference to a meeting of sorts and speculate as to who might come to it.

â€œYour name was mentioned, zurâ€”â€˜James Fraser,â€™ they said, and they mentioned the Ridge, too, so as I was sure â€™twas you they meant.â€

â€œWhat sort of meeting was it?â€ I asked curiously. â€œAnd where?â€

He shrugged, helpless.

â€œTook no notice, maâ€™am. Only they said â€™twas Monday next.â€

Neither did he recall the names of his hosts, having been too much occupied in trying to eat without being overcome by the presence of the pigs. He was plainly too occupied at the moment with the results of his unsuccessful courtship to give much mind to the details, and after a few questions and confused answers, Jamie sent him off.

â€œHave you any ideaâ€”â€ I began, but then saw that his brows were furrowed; he obviously did.

â€œThe meeting to choose delegates for a Continental Congress,â€ he said. â€œIt must be that.â€

He had had word after Flora MacDonaldâ€™s barbecue that the initial meeting place and time were to be abandoned, the organizers fearing interference. A new place and time would be established, John Ashe had told himâ€”word would be sent.

But that was before the contretemps in downtown Cross Creek.

â€œI suppose a note might have gone astray,â€ I suggested, but the suggestion was a feeble one.

â€œOne might,â€ he agreed. â€œNot six.â€

â€œSix?â€

â€œWhen I heard nothing, I wrote myself, to the six men I know personally within the Committee of Correspondence. No answer from any of them.â€ His stiff finger tapped once against his leg, but he noticed, and stilled it.

â€œThey donâ€™t trust you,â€ I said, after a momentâ€™s silence, and he shook his head.

â€œLittle wonder, I suppose, after I rescued Simms and tarred Neil Forbes in the public street.â€ Despite himself, a small smile flitted across his face at the memory. â€œAnd poor wee Bobby didna help, I expect; he would have told them he carried letters betwixt me and Lord John.â€

That was probably true. Friendly and garrulous, Bobby was capable of keeping a confidenceâ€”but only if you told him explicitly which confidence to keep. Otherwise, anyone who shared a meal with him would know all his business by the time the pudding came.

â€œCan you do anything else to find out? Where the meeting is, I mean?â€

He blew out his breath in mild frustration.

â€œAye, maybe. But if I did, and went thereâ€”thereâ€™s a great chance they would put me out. If not worse. I think the risk of such a breach isna worth it.â€ He glanced at me, with a wry expression. â€œI suppose I should have let them roast the printer.â€

I disregarded that, and came to stand beside him.

â€œYouâ€™ll think of something else,â€ I said, trying to be encouraging.

The big hour candle stood on his desk, half-burned, and he touched it. No one seemed ever to notice that the candle was never consumed.

â€œPerhaps . . .â€ he said meditatively. â€œI may find a way. Though I should hate to take another for the purpose.â€

Another gem, he meant.

I swallowed a small lump in my throat at the thought. There were two left. One each, if Roger, or Bree, and Jemmyâ€”but I choked that thought off firmly.

â€œWhat does it profit a man to gain the world,â€ I quoted, â€œif he lose his soul? It wonâ€™t do us any good to be secretly rich, if you get tarred and feathered.â€ I didnâ€™t like that thought any better, but it wasnâ€™t one I could avoid.

He glanced at his forearm; he had rolled up his sleeves for writing, and the fading burn still showed, a faint pink track among the sunbleached hairs. He sighed, went round his desk, and picked a quill from the jar.

â€œAye. Perhaps Iâ€™d best write a few more letters.â€

THE PALE HORSEMAN RIDES




ON THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER, Roger preached a sermon on the text, God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty. On the twenty-first of September, one of those weak things set out to prove the point.

Padraic and Hortense MacNeill and their children hadnâ€™t come to church. They always did, and their absence aroused commentâ€”enough that Roger asked Brianna next morning if she might walk round and visit, to see that there was nothing wrong.

â€œIâ€™d go myself,â€ he said, scraping the bottom of his porridge bowl, â€œbut Iâ€™ve promised to ride with John MacAfee and his father to Brownsville; he means to offer for a girl there.â€

â€œDoes he mean you to make them handfast on the spot if she says yes?â€ I asked. â€œOr are you just there to keep assorted Browns from assassinating him?â€ There had been no open violence since we had returned Lionel Brownâ€™s body, but there were occasional small clashes, when a party from Brownsville happened to meet men from the Ridge now and then in public.

â€œThe latter,â€ Roger said with a small grimace. â€œThough Iâ€™ve some hopes that a marriage or two betwixt the Ridge and Brownsville might help to mend matters, over time.â€

Jamie, reading a newspaper from the most recent batch, looked up at that.

â€œOh, aye? Well, itâ€™s a thought. Doesna always work out just so, though.â€ He smiled. â€œMy uncle Colum thought to mend just such a matter wiâ€™ the Grants, by marrying my mother to the Grant. Unfortunately,â€ he added, turning over a page, â€œmy mother wasna inclined to cooperate. She snubbed Malcolm Grant, stabbed my uncle Dougal, and eloped wiâ€™ my father, instead.â€

â€œReally?â€ Brianna hadnâ€™t heard that particular story; she looked enchanted. Roger gave her a sidelong glance, and coughed, ostentatiously removing the sharp knife with which sheâ€™d been cutting up sausages.

â€œWell, be that as it may,â€ he said, pushing back from the table, knife in hand. â€œIf ye wouldnâ€™t mind having a look-in on Padraicâ€™s family, just to see theyâ€™re all right?â€

In the event, Lizzie and I came along with Brianna, meaning to call on Marsali and Fergus, whose cabin was a little way beyond the MacNeillsâ€™. We met Marsali on the way, though, coming back from the whisky spring, and so there were four of us when we came to the MacNeillsâ€™ cabin.

â€œWhy are there so many flies, of a sudden?â€ Lizzie slapped at a large bluebottle that had landed on her arm, then waved at two more, circling round her face.

â€œSomethingâ€™s dead nearby,â€ Marsali said, lifting her nose to sniff the air. â€œIn the wood, maybe. Hear the crows?â€

There were crows, cawing in the treetops nearby; looking up, I saw more circling, black spots against the brilliant sky.

â€œNot in the wood,â€ Bree said, her voice suddenly strained. She was looking toward the cabin. The door was tightly shut, and a mass of flies milled over the hide-covered window. â€œHurry.â€

The smell in the cabin was unspeakable. I saw the girls gasp and clamp their mouths tight shut, as the door swung open. Unfortunately, it was necessary to breathe. I did so, very shallowly, as I moved across the dark room and ripped down the hide that had been tightly nailed across the window.

â€œLeave the door open,â€ I said, ignoring a faint moan of complaint from the bed at the influx of light. â€œLizzieâ€”go and start a smudge fire near the door and another outside the window. Start it with grass and kindling, then add somethingâ€”damp wood, moss, wet leavesâ€”to make it smoke.â€

Flies had begun to come in within seconds of my opening the window, and were whizzing past my faceâ€”deerflies, bluebottles, gnats. Drawn by the smell, they had been clustered on the sun-warmed logs outside, seeking entrance, avid for food, desperate to lay their eggs.

The room would be a buzzing hell in minutesâ€”but we needed light and air, and would just have to deal with the flies as best we might. I pulled off my kerchief and folded it into a makeshift flyswatter, slapping to and fro with it as I turned to the bed.

Hortense and the two children were there. All naked, their pallid limbs glimmering with the sweat of the sealed cabin. They were clammy white where the sunlight struck, legs and bodies streaked with reddish-brown. I hoped that it was only diarrhea, and not blood.

Someone had moaned; someone moved. Not dead then, thank God. The bedcoverings had been thrown to the floor in a tangled heapâ€”that was fortunate, as they were still mostly clean. I thought we had better burn the straw mattress, as soon as we got them off it.

â€œDo not put your fingers in your mouth,â€ I murmured to Bree, as we began to work, sorting the feebly twitching heap of humanity into its component parts.

â€œYou have got to be kidding,â€ she said, speaking through her teeth while smiling at a pale-faced child of five or six, who lay half-curled in the exhausted aftermath of a diarrhetic attack. She worked her hands under the little girlâ€™s armpits. â€œCome on, lovey, let me lift you.â€

The child was too weak to make any protest at being moved; her arms and legs hung limp as string. Her sisterâ€™s state was even more alarming; no more than a year old, the baby didnâ€™t move at all, and her eyes were sunk deep, a sign of severe dehydration. I picked up the tiny hand and gently pinched the skin between thumb and forefinger. It stayed for a moment, a tiny peak of grayish skin, then slowly, slowly, began to disappear.

â€œBloody fucking hell,â€ I said softly to myself and bent swiftly to listen, hand on the childâ€™s chest. She wasnâ€™t deadâ€”I could barely feel the bump of her heartâ€”but wasnâ€™t far from it. If she were too far gone to suck or drink, there was nothing that would save her.

Even as the thought passed through my mind, I was rising, looking about the cabin. No water; a hollowed gourd lay on its side by the bed, empty. How long had they been like this, with nothing to drink?

â€œBree,â€ I said, my voice level but urgent. â€œGo and get some waterâ€”quickly.â€

She had laid the older child on the floor, and was wiping the filth from her body; she glanced up, though, and the sight of my face made her drop the rag she was using and stand up at once. She grabbed the kettle I thrust into her hand and vanished; I heard her footsteps, running across the dooryard.

The flies were settling on Hortenseâ€™s face; I flapped the kerchief close to shoo them away. The cloth skimmed her nose, but her slack features barely twitched. She was breathing; I could see her belly, distended with gas, moving slightly.

Where was Padraic? Hunting, perhaps.

I caught a whiff of something under the overwhelming stench of voided bowels and leaned over, sniffing. A sweet, pungently fermented scent, like rotted apples. I put a hand under Hortenseâ€™s shoulder and pulled, rolling her toward me. There was a bottleâ€”emptyâ€”under her body. A whiff of it was enough to tell me what it had contained.

â€œBloody, bloody fucking hell,â€ I said, under my breath. Desperately ill and with no water to hand, she had drunk applejack, either to quench her thirst or to soothe the pain of the cramps. A logical thing to doâ€”save that alcohol was a diuretic. It would leach even more water from a body that was already seriously dehydrated, to say nothing of further irritating a gastrointestinal tract that scarcely needed it.

Bloody Christ, had she given it to the children, too?

I stooped to the elder child. She was limp as a ragdoll, head lolling on her shoulders, but there was still some resilience to her flesh. A pinch of the hand; the skin stayed peaked, but returned to normal faster than the babyâ€™s had.

Her eyes had opened when I pinched her hand. That was good. I smiled at her, and brushed the gathering flies away from her half-open mouth. The soft pink membranes were dry and sticky-looking.

â€œHallo, darling,â€ I said softly. â€œDonâ€™t worry now. Iâ€™m here.â€

And was that going to help? I wondered. Damn it all; if only I had been a day earlier!

I heard Breeâ€™s hurrying steps and met her at the door.

â€œI needâ€”â€ I began, but she interrupted me.

â€œMr. MacNeillâ€™s in the woods!â€ she said. â€œI found him on the way to the spring. Heâ€™sâ€”â€

The kettle in her hands was still empty. I seized it with a cry of exasperation.

â€œWater! I need water!â€

â€œBut Iâ€”Mr. MacNeill, heâ€™sâ€”â€

I thrust the kettle back into her hands and shoved past her.

â€œIâ€™ll find him,â€ I said. â€œGet water! Give it to themâ€”the baby first! Make Lizzie help youâ€”the fires can wait! Run!â€

I heard the flies first, a buzzing noise that made my skin crawl with revulsion. Out in the open, they had found him quickly, attracted by the smell. I took a hasty gulp of air and shoved through the buckbrush to where Padraic lay, collapsed in the grass beneath a sycamore.

He wasnâ€™t dead. I saw that at once; the flies were a cloud, not a blanketâ€”hovering, lighting, flicking away again as he twitched.

He lay curled on the ground, wearing only a shirt, a water jug lying near his head. I knelt by him, peering as I touched him. His shirt and legs were stained, as was the grass where he lay. The excrement was very wateryâ€”most had soaked into the soil by nowâ€”but there was some solid matter. Heâ€™d been stricken later than Hortense and the children, then; his guts hadnâ€™t been griping long, or there would be mostly water, tinged with blood.

â€œPadraic?â€

â€œMrs. Claire, thank the Lord yeâ€™ve come.â€ His voice was so hoarse I could scarcely make out words. â€œMy bairnies. Have ye got my bairnies safe?â€

He raised himself on one elbow, shaking, sweat plastering strands of gray hair to his cheeks. His eyes cracked open, trying to see me, but they were swelled to mere slits by the bites of deerflies.

â€œI have them.â€ I put a hand on him at once, squeezing to force reassurance into him. â€œLie down, Padraic. Wait a moment while I tend them, then Iâ€™ll see to you.â€ He was very ill, but not in immediate danger; the children were.

â€œDinna mind me,â€ Padraic muttered. â€œDinna . . . mind . . .â€ He swayed, brushed at the flies that crawled on his face and chest, then groaned as cramp seized his belly again, doubling as though some massive hand had crushed him in its grip.

I was already running back to the house. There were splashes of water in the dust of the pathâ€”good, Brianna had come this way, hurrying.

Amoebic dysentery? Food poisoning? Typhoid? Typhus? Choleraâ€”please God, not that. All of those, and a lot more, were currently lumped together simply as â€œthe bloody fluxâ€ in this time, and for obvious reasons. Not that it mattered in the short term.

The immediate danger of all the diarrhetic diseases was simple dehydration. In the effort to expel whatever microbial invader was irritating the gut, the gastrointestinal tract simply flushed itself repeatedly, depleting the body of the water necessary to circulate blood, to eliminate wastes, to cool the body by means of sweat, to maintain the brain and membranesâ€”the water necessary to maintain life.

If one could keep a patient sufficiently hydrated by means of intravenous saline and glucose infusions, then the gut would, most likely, heal itself eventually and the patient would recover. Without intravenous intervention, the only possibility was to administer fluids by mouth, or rectum as quickly and as constantly as possible, for as long as it took. If one could.

If the patient couldnâ€™t keep down even waterâ€”I didnâ€™t think the MacNeills were vomiting; I didnâ€™t recall that smell among the others in the cabin. Probably not cholera, then; that was something.

Brianna sat on the floor by the elder child, the little girlâ€™s head in her lap, pressing a cup against her mouth. Lizzie knelt by the hearth, face red with exertion as she kindled the fire. The flies were settling on the motionless body of the woman on the bed, and Marsali crouched over the limp form of the baby on her lap, frantically trying to rouse it to drink.

Spilled water streaked her skirt. I could see the tiny head lolled back on her lap, water dribbling down a slack and horribly flattened cheek.

â€œShe canâ€™t,â€ Marsali was saying, over and over. â€œShe canâ€™t, she canâ€™t!â€

Disregarding my own advice about fingers, I ruthlessly thrust an index finger into the babyâ€™s mouth, prodding the palate for a gag reflex. It was there; the baby choked on the water in its mouth and gasped, and I felt the tongue close hard against my finger for an instant.

Sucking. She was an infant, still breastfedâ€”and suckling is the first of the instincts for survival. I whirled to look at the woman, but a glance at her flat breasts and sunken nipples was enough; even so, I grabbed one breast, squeezing my fingers toward the nipple. Again, againâ€”no, no droplets of milk showed on the brownish nipples, and the breast tissue was flabby in my hand. No water, no milk.

Marsali, grasping what I was about, seized the neck of her blouse and ripped it down, pressing the child to her own bared breast. The tiny legs were limp against her dress, toes bruised and curled like wilted petals.

I was tipping back Hortenseâ€™s face, dribbling water into her open mouth. From the corner of my eye, I saw Marsali rhythmically squeezing her breast with one hand, an urgent massage to make the milk let down, even as my own fingers moved in an echo of the motion, massaging the unconscious womanâ€™s throat, urging her to swallow.

Her flesh was slick with sweat, but most of it was mine. Trickles of perspiration were running down my back, tickling between my buttocks. I could smell myself, a strange metallic scent, like hot copper.

The throat moved in sudden peristalsis, and I took my hand away. Hortense choked and coughed, then her head rolled to the side and her stomach heaved, sending its meager contents rocketing back up. I wiped the trace of vomit from her lips, and pressed the cup to her mouth again. Her lips didnâ€™t move; the water filled her mouth and dribbled down her face and neck.

Among the buzzing of the flies, I heard Lizzieâ€™s voice behind me, calm but abstracted, as though she spoke from a long way off.

â€œCan ye stop cursing, maâ€™am? Itâ€™s only that the weans can hear ye.â€

I jerked round at her, only then realizing that I had in fact been repeating â€œBloody fucking hell!â€ out loud, over and over as I worked.

â€œYes,â€ I said. â€œSorry.â€ And turned back to Hortense.

I got some water down her now and then, but not enough. Not nearly enough, given that her bowels were still trying to rid themselves of whatever troubled them. Bloody flux.

Lizzie was praying.

â€œHail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee . . .â€

Brianna was murmuring something under her breath, urgent sounds of maternal encouragement.

â€œBlessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus . . .â€

My thumb was on the pulse of the carotid artery. I felt it bump, skip, and go on, jerking along like a cart with a missing wheel. Her heart was beginning to fail, arrhythmic.

â€œHoly Mary, Mother of God . . .â€

I slammed my fist down on the center of her chest, and then again, and again, hard enough that the bed and the pale splayed body quivered under the blows. Flies rose in alarm from the soaked straw, buzzing.

â€œOh, no,â€ said Marsali softly behind me. â€œOh, no, no, please.â€ I had heard that tone of disbelief before, of protest and appeal deniedâ€”and knew what had happened.

â€œPray for us sinners . . .â€

As though she, too, had heard, Hortenseâ€™s head rolled suddenly to one side, and her eyes sprang open, staring toward the place where Marsali sat, though I thought she saw nothing. Then the eyes closed and she doubled suddenly, onto one side, legs drawn up nearly to her chin. Her head wrenched back, body tight in spasm, and then she suddenly relaxed. She would not let her child go alone. Bloody flux.

â€˜Now and at the hour of our death, amen. Hail Mary, full of grace . . .â€

Lizzieâ€™s soft voice went on mechanically, repeating her words of prayer as mindlessly as I had said mine earlier. I held Hortenseâ€™s wrist, checking for the pulse, but it was mere formality. Marsali curled over the tiny body in grief, rocking it against her breast. Milk dripped from the swollen nipple, coming slowly, then faster, falling like white rain on the small still face, futilely eager to nourish and sustain.

The air was still stifling, still thick with odor and flies and the sound of Lizzieâ€™s prayersâ€”but the cabin seemed empty, and curiously silent.

There was a shuffling noise outside; the sound of something being dragged, a grunt of pain and dreadful exertion. Then the soft sound of falling, a gasp of breath. Padraic had made it back to his own doorstep. Brianna looked to the door, but she still held the older girl in her arms, still alive.

I set down the limp hand that I held, carefully, and went to help.

A NOISOME PESTILENCE




THE DAYS WERE GROWING SHORTER, but light still came early. The windows at the front of the house faced east, and the rising sun glowed on the scrubbed white oak of my surgery floor. I could see the brilliant bar of light advancing across the hand-hewn boards; had I had an actual timepiece, I could have calibrated the floor like a sundial, marking the seams between the boards in minutes.

As it was, I marked them in heartbeats, waiting through the moments until the sun should have reached the counter where my microscope stood ready, slides and beaker beside it.

I heard soft footsteps in the corridor, and Jamie pushed the door open with his shoulder, a pewter mug of something hot held in each hand, wrapped with rags against the heat.

â€œCiamar a tha thu, mo chridhe,â€ he said softly, and handed one to me, brushing a kiss across my forehead. â€œHow is it, then?â€

â€œIt could be worse.â€ I gave him a smile of gratitude, though it was interrupted by a yawn. I didnâ€™t need to tell him that Padraic and his elder daughter still lived; he would have known at once by my face if anything dire had happened. In fact, bar any complications, I thought both would recover; I had stayed with them all night, rousing them hourly to drink a concoction of honeyed water, mixed with a little salt, alternating with a strong infusion of peppermint leaf and dogwood bark to calm the bowels.

I lifted the mugâ€”goosefoot teaâ€”closing my eyes as I inhaled the faint, bitter perfume, and feeling the tight muscles of my neck and shoulders relax in anticipation.

He had seen me twist my head to ease my neck; Jamieâ€™s hand came down on my nape, large and wonderfully warm from holding the hot tea. I gave a small moan of ecstasy at the touch, and he laughed low in his throat, massaging my sore muscles.

â€œShould ye not be abed, Sassenach? Yeâ€™ll not have slept at all the night.â€

â€œOh, I did . . . a bit.â€ I had dozed fitfully, sitting up by the open window, roused periodically by the startling touch on my face of the moths that flew in, drawn to the light of my candle. Mrs. Bug had come at dawn, though, fresh and starched, ready to take over the heavy nursing.

â€œIâ€™ll go lie down in a bit,â€ I promised. â€œBut I wanted to have a quick look first.â€ I waved vaguely toward my microscope, which stood assembled and ready on the table. Next to it were several small glass bottles, plugged with twists of cloth, each containing a brownish liquid. Jamie frowned at them.

â€œLook? At what?â€ he said. He lifted his long, straight nose, sniffing suspiciously. â€œIs that shit?â€

â€œYes, it is,â€ I said, not bothering to stifle a jaw-cracking yawn. I hadâ€”as discreetly as possibleâ€”collected samples from Hortense and the baby and, later, from my living patients, as well. Jamie eyed them.

â€œExactly what,â€ he inquired cautiously, â€œare ye looking for?â€

â€œWell, I donâ€™t know,â€ I admitted. â€œAnd in fact, I may not find anythingâ€”or anything I can recognize. But itâ€™s possible that it was either an amoeba or a bacillus that made the MacNeills sickâ€”and I think I would recognize an amoeba; theyâ€™re quite big. Relatively speaking,â€ I added hastily.

â€œOh, aye?â€ His ruddy brows drew together, then lifted. â€œWhy?â€

That was a better question than he knew.

â€œWell, partly for the sake of curiosity,â€ I admitted. â€œBut also, if I do find a causative organism that I can recognize, Iâ€™ll know a bit more about the diseaseâ€”how long it lasts, for instance, and whether there are any complications to look out for specially. And how contagious it is.â€

He glanced at me, cup half-raised to his mouth.

â€œIs it one you can catch?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I admitted. â€œThough Iâ€™m fairly sure it is. Iâ€™ve been vaccinated against typhus and typhoidâ€”but this doesnâ€™t look like either one of those. And there are no vaccines for dysentery or Giardia poisoning.â€

The brows drew together and stayed that way, knotted as he sipped his tea. His fingers gave my neck a final squeeze and dropped away.

I sipped cautiously at my own tea, sighing in pleasure as it gently scalded my throat and ran hot and comforting down into my stomach. Jamie lounged on his stool, long legs thrust out. He glanced down into the steaming cup between his hands.

â€œDâ€™ye think this tea is hot, Sassenach?â€ he asked.

I raised my own brows at that. Both cups were still wrapped in rags, and I could feel the heat seeping through to my palms.

â€œI do,â€ I said. â€œWhy?â€

He lifted the mug and took a mouthful of tea, which he held for a moment before swallowing; I could see the long muscles move in his throat.

â€œBrianna came into the kitchen whilst I was brewing the pot,â€ he said. â€œShe took down the basin, and the pannikin of soapâ€”and then she took a dipper of water steaming from the kettle, and poured it over her hands, one and then the other.â€ He paused a moment. â€œThe water was boiling when I took it off the fire a moment before.â€

The mouthful of tea I had taken went down crooked, and I coughed.

â€œDid she burn herself?â€ I said, when I had got my breath back.

â€œShe did,â€ he said, rather grimly. â€œShe scrubbed herself from fingertips to elbows, and I saw the blister on the side of her hand where the water fell.â€ He paused for a moment, and his eyes met mine over the mugs, dark blue with worry.

I took another sip of my un-honeyed tea. The room was cool enough, just past dawn, that my hot breath made tiny wisps of steam as I sighed.

â€œPadraicâ€™s baby died in Marsaliâ€™s arms,â€ I said quietly. â€œShe held the other child. She knows itâ€™s contagious.â€ And knowing, could not touch or pick up her own child without doing her best to wash away her fear.

Jamie moved uneasily.

â€œAye,â€ he began. â€œBut still . . .â€

â€œItâ€™s different,â€ I said, and put a hand on his wrist, as much for my own comfort as his.

The transient coolness of the morning air touched face and mind alike, dispelling the warm tangle of dreams. The grass and trees were still lit with a chilly dawn glow, blue-shadowed and mysterious, and Jamie seemed a solid point of reference, fixed in the shifting light.

â€œDifferent,â€ I repeated. â€œFor her, I mean.â€ I took a breath of the sweet morning air, smelling of wet grass and morning glories.

â€œI was born at the end of a warâ€”the Great War, they called it, because the world had never seen anything like it. I told you about it.â€ My voice held a slight question, and he nodded, eyes fixed on mine, listening.

â€œThe year after I was born,â€ I said, â€œthere was a great epidemic of influenza. All over the world. People died in hundreds and thousands; whole villages disappeared in the space of a week. And then came the other, my war.â€

The words were quite unconscious, but hearing them, I felt the corner of my mouth twitch with irony. Jamie saw it and a faint smile touched his own lips. He knew what I meantâ€”that odd sense of pride that comes of living through a terrible conflict, leaving one with a peculiar feeling of possession. His wrist turned, his fingers wrapping tight around my own.

â€œAnd she has never seen plague or war,â€ he said, beginning to understand. â€œNever?â€ His voice held something odd. Nearly incomprehensible, to a man born a warrior, brought up to fight as soon as he could lift a sword; born to the idea that he mustâ€”he wouldâ€”defend himself and his family by violence. An incomprehensible notionâ€”but a rather wonderful one.

â€œOnly as pictures. Films, I mean. Television.â€ That one he would never understand, and I could not explain. The way in which such pictures focused on war itself; bombs and planes and submarines, and the thrilling urgency of blood shed on purpose; a sense of nobility in deliberate death.

He knew what battlefields were really likeâ€”battlefields, and what came after them.

â€œThe men who fought in those warsâ€”and the womenâ€”they didnâ€™t die of the killing, most of them. They died like thisâ€”â€ A lift of my mug toward the open window, toward the peaceful mountains, the distant hollow where Padraic MacNeillâ€™s cabin lay hidden. â€œThey died of illness and neglect, because there wasnâ€™t any way to stop it.â€

â€œI have seen that,â€ he said softly, with a glance at the stoppered bottles. â€œPlague and ague run rampant in a city, half a regiment dead of flux.â€

â€œOf course you have.â€

Butterflies were rising among the flowers in the dooryard, cabbage whites and sulfur yellows, here and there the great, lazy sail of a late tiger swallowtail out of the shadow of the wood. My thumb still rested on his wrist, feeling his heartbeat, slow and powerful.

â€œBrianna was born seven years after penicillin came into common use. She was born in Americaâ€”not this oneâ€â€”I nodded toward the window againâ€”â€œbut that one, that will be. There, it isnâ€™t usual for lots of people to die of contagious illness.â€ I glanced at him. The light had reached his waist, and glowed on the metal cup in his hand.

â€œDo you remember the first person you knew of who had died?â€

His face went blank with surprise, then sharpened, thinking. After a moment, he shook his head.

â€œMy brother was the first who was important, but I kent others before him, surely.â€

â€œI canâ€™t remember, either.â€ My parents, of course; their deaths had been personalâ€”but born in England, I had lived in the shadow of cenotaphs and memorials, and people just beyond the bounds of my own family died regularly; I had a sudden vivid memory, of my father putting on a homburg and dark coat to go to the bakerâ€™s wifeâ€™s funeral. Mrs. Briggs, her name had been. But she hadnâ€™t been the first; I knew already about death and funerals. How old had I been thenâ€”four, perhaps?

I was very tired. My eyes felt grainy from lack of sleep, and the delicate early light was brightening to full sun.

â€œI think Frankâ€™s was the first death Brianna ever experienced personally. Maybe there were others; I canâ€™t be sure. But the point isâ€”â€

â€œI see the point.â€ He reached to take the empty cup from my hand, and set it on the counter, then drained his own and set it down, too.

â€œBut itâ€™s no herself she fears for, aye?â€ he asked, his eyes penetrating. â€œItâ€™s the wean.â€

I nodded. She would have known, of course, in an academic sort of way, that such things were possible. But to have a child die suddenly before you, from something like a simple case of diarrhea . . .

â€œSheâ€™s a good mother,â€ I said, and yawned suddenly. She was. But it would never have struck her in any visceral way that something so negligible as a germ could suddenly snatch away her child. Not until yesterday.

Jamie stood up suddenly, and pulled me to my feet.

â€œGo to bed, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œThat will wait.â€ He nodded at the microscope. â€œIâ€™ve never known shit spoil with keeping.â€

I laughed, and collapsed slowly against him, my cheek pressed against his chest.

â€œMaybe youâ€™re right.â€ Still, I didnâ€™t push away. He held me, and we watched the sunlight grow, creeping slowly up the wall.

AMOEBA




I TURNED THE MIRROR OF the microscope a fraction of an inch further, to get as much light as I could.

â€œThere.â€ I stepped back, motioning Malva to come and look. â€œDo you see it? The big, clear thing in the middle, lobed, with the little flecks in it?â€

She frowned, squinting one-eyed into the ocular, then drew in her breath in a gasp of triumph.

â€œI see it plain! Like a currant pudding someoneâ€™s dropped on the floor, no?â€

â€œThatâ€™s it,â€ I said, smiling at her description in spite of the general seriousness of our investigation. â€œItâ€™s an amoebaâ€”one of the bigger sorts of microorganisms. And I very much think itâ€™s our villain.â€

We were looking at slides made from the stool samples I had retrieved from all the sick so farâ€”for Padraicâ€™s family was not the only one affected. There were three families with at least one person ill with a vicious bloody fluxâ€”and in all of the samples I had looked at so far, I had found this amoebic stranger.

â€œIs it really?â€ Malva had looked up when I spoke, but now returned to the eyepiece, absorbed. â€œHowever can something so small cause such a stramash in something so big as a person?â€

â€œWell, there is an explanation,â€ I said, swishing another slide gently through the dye bath and setting it to dry. â€œBut it would take me a bit of time to tell you, all about cellsâ€”you remember, I showed you the cells from the lining of your mouth?â€

She nodded, frowning slightly, and ran her tongue along inside her cheek.

â€œWell, the body makes all kinds of different cells, and there are special kinds of cells whose business it is to fight bacteriaâ€”the small, roundish sorts of things, you remember those?â€ I gestured at the slide, which being fecal matter, had the usual vast quantities of Escherichia coli and the like.

â€œBut there are millions of different sorts, and sometimes a microorganism comes along that the special cells arenâ€™t able to deal with. You knowâ€”I showed you the Plasmodium in Lizzieâ€™s blood?â€ I nodded toward the stoppered vial on the counter; I had taken blood from Lizzie only a day or two before, and shown the malarial parasites in the cells to Malva. â€œAnd I do think that this amoeba of ours may well be one like that.â€

â€œOh, well. Will we give the sick folk the penicillin, then?â€ I smiled a little at the eager â€œwe,â€ though there was little enough to smile at in the situation overall.

â€œNo, Iâ€™m afraid penicillin isnâ€™t effective against amoebic dysenteryâ€”thatâ€™s what you call a very bad flux, a dysentery. No, Iâ€™m afraid weâ€™ve nothing much to be going on with save herbs.â€ I opened the cupboard and ran an eye over the ranks of bottles and gauze-wrapped bundles, puzzling.

â€œWormwood, for a start.â€ I took the jar down and handed it to Malva, who had come to stand beside me, looking with interest into the mysteries of the cupboard. â€œGarlic, thatâ€™s generally useful for infections of the digestive tractâ€”but it makes quite a good poultice for skin things, as well.â€

â€œWhat about onions? My grannie would steam an onion, and put it to my ear, when I was a wee bairn and had the earache. It smelt something dreadful, but it did work!â€

â€œIt canâ€™t hurt. Run out to the pantry, then, and fetch . . . oh, three big ones, and several heads of garlic.â€

â€œOh, at once, maâ€™am!â€ She set down the wormwood and dashed out, sandals flapping. I turned back to the shelves, trying to calm my own sense of urgency.

I was torn between the urge to be with the sick, nursing them, and the need to make medicines that might be of help. But there were other people who could do the nursing, and no one but me who knew enough to try to compound an antiparasitic remedy.

Wormwood, garlic . . . agrimony. And gentian. Anything with a very high content of copper or sulfurâ€”oh, rhubarb. We were past the growing season, but Iâ€™d had a fine crop and had put up several dozen bottles of the boiled pulp and syrup, as Mrs. Bug liked it for pies, and it provided some vitamin C for the winter months. That would make a splendid base for the medicine. Add perhaps slippery elm, for its soothing effects on the intestinal tractâ€”though such effects were likely to be so slight as to be unnoticeable against the ravages of such a virulent onslaught.

I began pounding wormwood and agrimony in my mortar, meanwhile wondering where the bloody hell the thing had come from. Amoebic dysentery was normally a disease of the tropics, though God knew, Iâ€™d seen any number of peculiar tropical diseases on the coast, brought in with the slave and sugar trade from the Indiesâ€”and not a few further inland, too, since any such disease that wasnâ€™t instantly fatal tended to become chronic and move along with its victim.

It wasnâ€™t impossible that one of the fisher-folk had contracted it during the journey from the coast, and while being one of the fortunate persons who suffered only a mild infection, was now carrying the encysted form of the amoeba around in his or her digestive tract, all ready to shed infective cysts right and left.

Why this sudden outbreak? Dysentery was almost always spread via contaminated food or water. Whatâ€”

â€œHere, maâ€™am.â€ Malva was back, breathless from her hurry, several large brown onions in hand, crackling and glossy, and a dozen garlic heads bundled in her apron. I set her to slicing them up, and had the happy inspiration of telling her to stew them in honey. I didnâ€™t know whether the antibacterial effect of honey would be likewise effective against an amoeba, but it couldnâ€™t hurtâ€”and might conceivably make the mixture a little more palatable; it was shaping up to be more than a trifle eye-watering, between the onions, the garlic, and the rhubarb.

â€œPhew! What are you guys doing in here?â€ I looked up from my macerating to see Brianna in the door, looking deeply suspicious, nose wrinkled against the smell.

â€œOh. Well . . .â€ Iâ€™d become habituated to it myself, but in fact, the air in the surgery was fairly thick with the smell of fecal samples, now augmented by waves of onion fumes. Malva looked up, eyes streaming, and sniffed, wiping her nose on her apron.

â€œWeâ€™re magking bedicine,â€ she informed Bree, with considerable dignity.

â€œIs anyone else fallen sick?â€ I asked anxiously, but she shook her head and edged into the room, fastidiously avoiding the counter where I had been making slides of fecal material.

â€œNo, not that Iâ€™ve heard. I took some food over to the McLachlansâ€™ this morning, and they said only the two little ones had it. Mrs. Coinneach said sheâ€™d had diarrhea a couple of days ago, but not bad, and sheâ€™s all right now.â€

â€œTheyâ€™re giving the little ones honey water?â€

She nodded, a small frown between her eyebrows.

â€œI saw them. They look pretty sick, but nothing like the MacNeills.â€ She looked rather sick herself, at the memory, but shook it off, turning to the high cupboard.

â€œCan I borrow a little sulfuric acid, Mama?â€ Sheâ€™d brought an earthenware cup with her, and the sight of it made me laugh.

â€œOrdinary people borrow a cup of sugar,â€ I told her, nodding at it. â€œOf course. Be careful with it, thoughâ€”youâ€™d best put it in one of those vials with a waxed cork. You do not want to chance tripping and spilling it.â€

â€œI definitely donâ€™t,â€ she assured me. â€œI only need a few drops, though; Iâ€™m going to dilute it down pretty far. Iâ€™m making paper.â€

â€œPaper?â€ Malva blinked, red-eyed, and sniffed. â€œHow?â€

â€œWell, you squish up anything fibrous you can get your hands on,â€ Bree told her, making squishing motions with both hands in illustrations. â€œOld bits of used paper, old rags of cloth, bits of yarn or thread, some of the softer sorts of leaves or flowers. Then you soak the mash for days and days in water andâ€”if you happen to have someâ€”dilute sulfuric acid.â€ One long finger tapped the square bottle affectionately.

â€œThen once the mash is all digested down to a sort of pulp, you can spread a thin layer of it on screens, press out the water, let it dry, and hey-presto, paper!â€

I could see Malva mouthing â€œhey-prestoâ€ to herself, and turned away a little, so she couldnâ€™t see me smile. Brianna uncorked the big square bottle of acid and, very carefully, poured a few drops into her cup. Immediately, the hot smell of sulfur rose like a demon amidst the miasma of feces and onions.

Malva stiffened, eyes still streaming but wide.

â€œWhat is that?â€ she said.

â€œSulfuric acid,â€ Bree said, looking at her curiously.

â€œVitriol,â€ I amended. â€œHave you seenâ€”er, smelled it before?â€

She nodded, put the sliced onions into a pot, and put the lid neatly on.

â€œAye, I have.â€ She came to look at the green glass bottle, dabbing at her eyes. â€œMy motherâ€”she died when I was youngâ€”she had some of that. I remember the smell of it, and how sheâ€™d say as I mustnâ€™t touch it, ever. Brimstone, folk called the smellâ€”a whiff oâ€™ brimstone.â€

â€œReally? I wonder what she used it for.â€ I did wonder, and with a certain sense of unease. An alchemist or an apothecary might have the stuff; the only reason that I knew of for a common citizen to keep it was as a means of aggressionâ€”to throw at someone.

But Malva only shook her head, and turning, went back to the onions and garlic. Iâ€™d caught the look on her face, though; a queer expression of hostility and longing that rang a small, unsuspected bell somewhere inside me.

Longing for a mother long deadâ€”and the fury of a small girl, abandoned. Bewildered and alone.

â€œWhat?â€ Brianna was watching my face, frowning slightly. â€œWhatâ€™s wrong?â€

â€œNothing,â€ I said, and put a hand on her arm, just to feel the strength and joy of her presence, the years of her growth. Tears stung my eyes, but that could be put down to onions. â€œNothing at all.â€



I WAS GETTING TERRIBLY tired of funerals. This was the third, in as many days. We had buried Hortense and the baby together, then the older Mrs. Ogilvie. Now it was another child, one of Mrs. MacAfeeâ€™s twins. The other twin, a boy, stood by his sisterâ€™s grave, in a shock so profound that he looked like a walking ghost himself, though the disease hadnâ€™t touched him.

We were later than intendedâ€”the coffin hadnâ€™t been quite readyâ€”and the night was rising around us. All the gold of the autumn leaves had faded into ash, and white mist was curling through the dark wet trunks of the pines. One could hardly imagine a more desolate sceneâ€”and yet it was in a way more fitting than the bright sunshine and fresh breeze that had blown when we buried Hortense and little Angelica.

â€œThe Lord is my shepherd. He leadeth me besideâ€”â€ Rogerâ€™s voice cracked painfully, but no one seemed to notice. He struggled for a moment, swallowing hard, and went on, doggedly. He held the little green Bible in his hands, but wasnâ€™t looking at it; he was speaking from memory, and his eyes went from Mr. MacDuff, standing alone, for his wife and his sister were both sick, to the little boy beside himâ€”a little boy about Jemmyâ€™s age.

â€œThough I walk . . . though I walk through the valley of death, I shall . . . shall fear no evilâ€”â€ His voice was trembling audibly, and I saw that tears were running down his face. I looked for Bree; she was standing a little way behind the mourners, Jem half-swaddled in the folds of her dark cloak. The hood of it was drawn up, but her face was visible, pale in the gloaming, Our Lady of Sorrows.

Even Major MacDonaldâ€™s red coat was muted, charcoal-gray in the last vestiges of light. He had arrived in the afternoon, and helped to carry up the little coffin; he stood now, hat somberly tucked beneath his arm, wigged head bowed, his face invisible. He, too, had a childâ€”a daughter, somewhere back in Scotland with her mother.

I swayed a little, and felt Jamieâ€™s hand under my elbow. I had been without sleep for most of the last three days, and had taken precious little food. I didnâ€™t feel either hungry or tired, though; I felt remote and unreal, as though the wind blew through me.

The father uttered a cry of inconsolable grief, and sank suddenly down upon the heap of dirt thrown up by the grave. I felt Jamieâ€™s muscles contract in instinctive compassion toward him, and pulled away a little, murmuring, â€œGo.â€

I saw him cross swiftly to Mr. MacAfee, bend to whisper to him, put an arm around him. Roger had stopped talking.

My thoughts would not obey me. Try as I might to fix them on the proceedings, they strayed away. My arms ached; I had been pounding herbs, lifting patients, carrying water . . . I felt as though I were doing all these things over and over, could feel the repetitive thud of pestle in mortar, the dragging weight of fainting bodies. I was seeing in vivid memory the slides of Entameba, greedy pseudopodia flowing in slow-motion appetite. Water, I heard water flowing; it lived in water, though only the cystic form was infective. It was passed on by means of water. I thought that very clearly.

Then I was lying on the ground, with no memory of falling, no memory of ever being upright, the smell of fresh, damp dirt and fresh, damp wood strong in my nose, and a vague thought of worms. There was a flutter of motion before my eyes; the small green Bible had fallen and lay on the dirt in front of my face, the wind turning over its pages, one by one by one in a ghostly game of sortes Virgilianaeâ€”where would it stop? I wondered dimly.

There were hands and voices, but I could not pay attention. A great amoeba floated majestically in darkness before me, pseudopodia flowing slowly, slowly, in welcoming embrace.

MOMENT OF DECISION




FEVER ROLLED ACROSS MY MIND like a thunderstorm, jagged forks of pain crackling through my body in bursts of brilliance, each a lightning bolt that glowed for a vivid moment along some nerve or plexus, lighting up the hidden hollows of my joints, burning down the length of muscle fibers. A merciless brilliance, it struck again, and again, the fiery sword of a destroying angel who gave no quarter.

I seldom knew whether my eyes were open or closed, nor whether I woke or slept. I saw nothing but a roiling gray, turbulent and shot with red. The redness pulsed in veins and patches, shrouded in the cloud. I seized upon one crimson vein and followed its path, clinging to the track of its sullen glow amid the buffeting of thunder. The thunder grew louder as I penetrated deeper and deeper into the murk that boiled around me, becoming hideously regular, like the beating of a kettledrum, so that my ears rang with it, and I felt myself a hollow skin, tight-stretched, vibrating with each crash of sound.

The source of it was now before me, throbbing so loudly that I felt I must shout, only to hear some other soundâ€”but though I felt my lips draw back and my throat swell with effort, I heard nothing but the pounding. In desperation, I thrust my handsâ€”if they were my handsâ€”through the misty gray and seized some warm, moist object, very slippery, that throbbed, convulsing in my hands.

I looked down and knew it all at once to be my own heart.

I dropped it in horror, and it crawled away in a trail of reddish slime, shuddering with effort, the valves all opening and closing like the mouths of suffocating fish, each popping open with a hollow click, closing again with a small, meaty thud.

Faces sometimes appeared in the clouds. Some seemed familiar, though I could put no name to them. Others were the faces of strangers, the half-seen, unknown faces that flit sometimes through the mind on the verge of sleep. These looked at me with curiosity or indifferenceâ€”then turned away.

The others, the ones I knew, bore looks of sympathy or worry; they would seek to fix my gaze with theirs, but my glance slid guiltily off, giddily away, unable to gain traction. Their lips moved, and I knew they spoke to me, but I heard nothing, their words drowned by the silent thunder of my storm.



I FELT QUITE ODDâ€” but, for the first time in uncountable days, not ill. The fever clouds had rolled back; still grumbling softly somewhere near, but for the moment, gone from sight. My eyes were clear; I could see the raw wood in the beams overhead.

In fact, I saw the wood with such clarity that I was struck with awe at the beauty of it. The loops and whorls of the polished grain seemed at once static and alive with grace, the colors of it shimmering with smoke and the essence of the earth, so that I could see how the beam was transformed and yet held still the spirit of the tree.

I was so entranced by this that I reached out my hand to touch itâ€”and did. My fingers brushed the wood with delight at the cool surface and the grooves of the axmarks, wing-shaped and regular as a flight of geese along the beam. I could hear the beating of powerful wings, and at the same time, feel the flex and swing of my shoulders, the vibration of joy through my forearms as the ax fell on the wood. As I explored this fascinating sensation, it occurred to me, dimly, that the beam was eight feet above the bed.

I turnedâ€”with no sense whatever of effortâ€”and saw that I lay upon the bed below.

I lay on my back, the quilts rumpled and scattered, as though I had tried at some point to throw them off but lacked the strength to do so. The air in the room was strangely still, and the blocks of color in the fabric glowed through it like jewels at the bottom of the sea, rich but muted.

By contrast, my skin was the color of pearls, bloodless pale and shimmering. And then I saw that this was because I was so thin that the skin of face and limb pressed hard upon the bone, and it was the gleam of bone and cartilage below that gave that luster to my face, smooth hardness shining through transparent skin.

And such bones as they were! I was filled with wonder at the marvel of their shaping. My eyes followed the delicacy of the arching ribs, the heartbreaking beauty of the sculptured skull with a sense of awed astonishment.

My hair was tumbled, matted, and snarled . . . and yet I felt myself drawn to it, tracing its curves with eye and . . . finger? For I had no consciousness of moving, and yet I felt the softness of the strands, the cool silk of brown and the springing vibrancy of silver, heard the hairs chime softly past each other, a rustle of notes cascading like a harpâ€™s.

My God, I said, and heard the words, though no sound stirred the air, you are so lovely!

My eyes were open. I looked deep and met a gaze of amber and soft gold. The eyes looked through me, to something far beyondâ€”and yet they saw me, too. I saw the pupils dilate slightly, and felt the warmth of their darkness embrace me with knowledge and acceptance. Yes, said those knowing eyes. I know you. Let us go. I felt a sense of great peace, and the air around me stirred, like wind rushing through feathers.

Then some sound turned me toward the window and I saw the man who stood there. I had no name for him, and yet I loved him. He stood with his back turned to the bed, arms braced on the sill, and his head sunk on his chest, so the dawn light glowed red on his hair and traced his arms with gold. A spasm of grief shook him; I felt it, like the temblors of a distant quake.

Someone moved near him. A dark-haired woman, a girl. She came close, touched his back, murmuring something to him. I saw the way she looked at him, the tender inclination of her head, the intimacy of her body swaying toward him.

No, I thought, with great calm. That wonâ€™t do.

I looked once more at myself lying on the bed, and with a feeling that was at once firm decision and incalculable regret, I took another breath.

I AM THE RESURRECTION,

PART 2




I STILL SLEPT FOR LONG PERIODS, waking only briefly to take nourishment. Now the fever dreams were gone, though, and sleep was a lake of deep black water, where I breathed oblivion and drifted past the waving waterweed, mindless as a fish.

I would float sometimes just below the surface, aware of people and things in the air-breathing world, but incapable of joining them. Voices spoke near me, muffled and meaningless. Now and then some phrase would penetrate the clear liquid around me and float into my head, where it would hang like a tiny jellyfish, round and transparent, yet pulsating with some mysterious inner meaning, its words a drifting net.

Each phrase hung for a time in my purview, folding and unfolding in its curious rhythms, and then drifted quietly up and away, leaving silence.

And in between the small jellyfish came open spaces of clear water, some filled with radiant light, some the darkness of utter peace. I drifted upward and downward, suspended between the surface and the depths, at the whim of unknown currents.

â€œPhysician, look.â€ Fizz. A stirring there, some dormant spore of consciousness, disturbed by carbonation, splits and blooms. Then a stab as sharp as metal, Who is calling me? â€œPhysician, look.â€

I opened my eyes.

It was no great shock, for the room was filled with twilight, still light, like being underwater, and I had no sense of disruption.

â€œO Lord Jesus Christ, Thou great Physician: Look with Thy gracious favor upon this Thy servant; give wisdom and discretion to those who minister to her in her sickness; bless all the means used for her recovery . . .â€

The words flowed past me in a whispering stream, cool on my skin. There was a man before me, dark head bent over a book. The light in the room embraced him and he seemed part of it.

â€œStretch forth Thy hand,â€ he whispered to the pages, in a voice that cracked and broke, â€œand according to Thy will, restore her to health and strength, that she may live to praise Thee for Thy goodness and Thy grace; to the glory of Thy holy name. Amen.â€

â€œRoger?â€ I said, groping for his name. My own voice was hoarse from disuse; speaking was an intolerable effort.

His eyes were closed in prayer; they sprang open, unbelieving, and I thought how vivid they were, the green of wet serpentine and summer leaves.

â€œClaire?â€ His voice cracked like a teenaged boyâ€™s, and he dropped the book.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I said, feeling the dreamlike sense of submergence threatening to engulf me again. â€œAm I?â€



I COULD LIFT A HAND for a moment or two, but was too weak even to lift my head, let alone sit up. Roger helpfully dragged me semi-upright against piled pillows, and put his hand at the back of my head to prevent wobbling, holding a cup of water to my dry lips. It was the odd feel of his hand on the bare skin of my neck that began a dim process of realization. Then I felt the warmth of his hand, vivid and immediate, at the back of my head, and jerked like a gaffed salmon, sending the cup flying.

â€œWhat? What?â€ I spluttered, clutching my head, too shocked to formulate a complete sentence, and oblivious to the cold water soaking through the sheets. â€œWHAT?!â€

Roger looked nearly as shocked as I felt. He swallowed, searching for words. â€œI . . . I . . . I thought you knew,â€ he stammered, voice breaking. â€œDidnâ€™t you . . . ? I mean . . . I thought . . . look, itâ€™ll grow!â€

I could feel my mouth working, vainly trying different shapes that might approximate words, but there was no connection between tongue and brainâ€”there was room for nothing but the realization that the accustomed soft, heavy weight of my hair was gone, replaced by a fuzz of bristles.

â€œMalva and Mrs. Bug cut it off, day before yesterday,â€ Roger said, all in a rush. â€œTheyâ€”we werenâ€™t here, Bree nor I, we wouldnâ€™t have let them, of course we wouldnâ€™tâ€”but they thought itâ€™s what you do for someone with a terrible fever, it is what people do now. Bree was furious with them, but they thoughtâ€”they truly thought they were helping save your lifeâ€”oh, God, Claire, donâ€™t look like that, please!â€

His face had disappeared in a starburst of light, a curtain of shimmering water suddenly coming down to protect me from the gaze of the world.

I wasnâ€™t conscious of crying, at all. Grief simply burst from me, like wine spraying from a wineskin stabbed with a knife. Purple-red as bone marrow, splattering and dripping everywhere.

â€œIâ€™ll fetch Jamie!â€ he croaked.

â€œNO!â€ I seized him by the sleeve, with more strength than I would have imagined I possessed. â€œGod, no! I donâ€™t want him to see me like this!â€

His momentary silence told me, but I kept stubborn hold of his sleeve, unable to think how else to prevent the unthinkable. I blinked, water sliding over my face like a stream over rock, and Roger wavered once more into visibility, blurred around the edges.

â€œHeâ€™s . . . er . . . heâ€™s seen you,â€ Roger said gruffly. He looked down, not wanting to meet my eyes. â€œIt. Already. I meanâ€”â€ He waved a hand vaguely in the vicinity of his own black locks. â€œHe saw it.â€

â€œHe did?â€ This was nearly as much a shock as the initial discovery. â€œWhatâ€”what did he say?â€

He took a deep breath and looked back up, like someone fearing to see a Gorgon. Or the anti-Gorgon, I thought bitterly.

â€œHe didnâ€™t say anything,â€ Roger said quite gently, and put a hand on my arm. â€œHeâ€”he just cried.â€

I was still crying, too, but in a more orthodox fashion now. Less of the gasping note. The sense of bone-deep cold had passed, and my limbs felt warm now, though I still felt a disconcertingly chilly breeze on my scalp. My heart was slowing again, and a faint sense that I was standing outside my body came over me.

Shock? I thought, dimly surprised as the word formed itself in my mind, rubbery and melting. I supposed that one could suffer true physical shock as the result of emotional woundsâ€”of course one could, I knew that. . . .

â€œClaire!â€ I became aware that Roger was calling my name with increasing urgency, and shaking my arm. With immense effort, I brought my eyes to focus on him. He was looking truly alarmed, and I wondered, vaguely, whether I had started to die again. But noâ€”it was too late for that.

â€œWhat?â€

He sighedâ€”with relief, I thought.

â€œYou looked funny for a moment.â€ His voice was cracked and husky; he sounded as though it hurt him to talk. â€œI thoughtâ€”dâ€™ye want another drink of water?â€

The suggestion seemed so incongruous that I nearly laughed. But I was terribly thirstyâ€”and all at once, a cup of cold water seemed the most desirable thing in the world.

â€œYes.â€ The tears continued to flow down my face, but now seemed almost soothing. I made no attempt to stop themâ€”that seemed much too difficultâ€”but blotted my face with a corner of the damp sheet.

It was beginning to dawn on me that I might not have made the wisestâ€”or at least not the easiestâ€”choice, when I decided not to die. Things outside the limits and concerns of my own body were starting to come back. Troubles, difficulties, dangers . . . sorrow. Dark, frightening things, like a swarm of bats. I didnâ€™t want to look too closely at the images that lay in a disorderly pile at the bottom of my brainâ€”things I had jettisoned in the struggle to stay afloat.

But if I had come back, I had come back to be what I wasâ€”and I was a doctor.

â€œThe . . . sickness.â€ I blotted the last of the tears and let Roger wrap his hands around mine, helping me to hold the new cup. â€œIs it stillâ€”?â€

â€œNo.â€ He spoke gently, and guided the rim of the cup to my lips. What was it? I wondered vaguely. Water, but with something in itâ€”mint and something stronger, more bitter . . . angelica?

â€œItâ€™s stopped.â€ Roger held the cup, letting me sip slowly. â€œNo oneâ€™s fallen sick in the last week.â€

â€œA week?â€ I bobbled the cup, spilling a little down my chin. â€œHow long have Iâ€”â€

â€œJust about that.â€ He cleared his throat. Rogerâ€™s eyes were intent on the cup; he skimmed a thumb lightly along my chin, removing the drops I had spilled. â€œYou were among the last to fall sick.â€

I took a long breath, then drank a bit more. The liquid had a soft, sweet taste, too, floating over the bitter tang . . . honey. My mind located the word and I felt a sense of relief at having located this small missing piece of reality.

I knew from his manner that some of the sick had died, but asked no more for the moment. Deciding to live was one thing. Rejoining the world of the living was a struggle that would take strength I didnâ€™t have right now. I had pulled up my roots, and lay like a wilted plant; sinking them back into the earth was beyond me for the moment.

The knowledge that people I knewâ€”perhaps had lovedâ€”had died seemed an equal grief to the loss of my hairâ€”and either was more than I could cope with.

I drank two further cups of honey-sweetened water, despite the underlying bitterness, then lay back with a sigh, my stomach feeling like a small, cold balloon.

â€œYe want to take a bit of rest,â€ Roger advised me, putting down the cup on the table. â€œIâ€™ll fetch Brianna, aye? But you sleep if ye want to.â€

I hadnâ€™t strength to nod, but managed a twitch of the lips that seemed to pass muster as a smile. I reached up a trembling hand and brushed it gingerly over the top of my shorn head. Roger flinched, very slightly.

He rose, and I saw how thin and strained he lookedâ€”he would have been helping tend the sick all week, I supposed, not only me. And bury the dead. He was licensed to conduct funerals.

â€œRoger?â€ It was a terrible effort to speak; so terribly hard to find the words, separate them from the tangle in my head. â€œHave you eaten anything recently?â€

His face changed then, a look of relief lightening the lines of strain and worry.

â€œNo,â€ he said, cleared his throat again, and smiled. â€œNot since last night.â€

â€œOh. Well,â€ I said, and lifted one hand, heavy as lead. â€œDo. Get something. Wonâ€™t you?â€

â€œYes,â€ he said. â€œI will.â€ Instead of leaving, though, he hesitated, then took several rapid strides back, bent over the bed, and seizing my face between his palms, kissed me on the forehead.

â€œYouâ€™re beautiful,â€ he said fiercely, and with a final squeeze of my cheeks, left.

â€œWhat?â€ I said faintly, but the only answer was the bellying of the curtain as the breeze came in, scented with apples.



IN POINT OF FACT, I looked like a skeleton with a particularly unflattering crew cut, as I learned when I finally gained sufficient strength as to force Jamie to bring me a looking glass.

â€œI dinna suppose yeâ€™d think of wearing a cap?â€ he suggested, diffidently fingering a muslin specimen that Marsali had brought me. â€œOnly until it grows out a bit?â€

â€œI donâ€™t suppose I bloody would.â€

I had some difficulty in saying this, shocked as I was by the horrifying vision in the glass. In fact, I had a strong impulse to seize the cap from his hands, put it on and pull it down to my shoulders.

I had rejected earlier offers of a cap from Mrs. Bugâ€”who had been volubly congratulating herself on my survival as the obvious result of her fever treatmentâ€”and from Marsali, Malva, and every other woman whoâ€™d come to visit me.

This was simple contrariness on my part; the sight of my unrestrained hair outraged their Scottish sense of what was proper in a woman, and theyâ€™d been tryingâ€”with varying degrees of subtletyâ€”to force me into a cap for years. I was damned if Iâ€™d let circumstance accomplish it for them.

Having now seen myself in a mirror, I felt somewhat less adamant about it. And my scalped head did feel a bit chilly. On the other hand, I realized that if I were to give in, Jamie would be terribly alarmedâ€”and I thought Iâ€™d frightened him quite enough, judging by the hollow look of his face and the deep smudges under his eyes.

As it was, his face had lightened considerably when I rejected the cap he was holding, and he tossed it aside.

I carefully turned the looking glass over and set it on the counterpane, repressing a sigh.

â€œAlways good for a laugh, I suppose, seeing the expressions on peopleâ€™s faces when they catch sight of me.â€

Jamie glanced at me, the corner of his mouth twitching.

â€œYeâ€™re verra beautiful, Sassenach,â€ he said gently. Then he burst out laughing, snorting through his nose and wheezing. I raised one eyebrow at him, picked up the glass and looked againâ€”which made him laugh harder.

I leaned back against the pillows, feeling a bit better. The fever had quite gone, but I still felt wraithlike and weak, barely able to sit up unassisted, and I fell asleep almost without warning, after the least exertion.

Jamie, still snorting, took my hand, raised it to his mouth, and kissed it. The sudden warm immediacy of the touch rippled the fair hairs of my forearm, and my fingers closed involuntarily on his.

â€œI love you,â€ he said very softly, his shoulders still trembling with laughter.

â€œOh,â€ I said, suddenly feeling quite a lot better. â€œWell, then. I love you, too. And it will grow, after all.â€

â€œSo it will.â€ He kissed my hand again, and set it gently on the quilt. â€œHave ye eaten?â€

â€œA bit,â€ I said, with what forbearance I could muster. â€œIâ€™ll have more later.â€

I had realized many years before why â€œpatientsâ€ are called that; itâ€™s because a sick person is generally incapacitated, and thus obliged to put up with any amount of harassment and annoyance from persons who are not sick.

The fever had broken and I had regained consciousness two days before; since then, the invariable response of everyone who saw me was to gasp at my appearance, urge me to wear a capâ€”and then try to force food down my throat. Jamie, more sensitive to my tones of voice than were Mrs. Bug, Malva, Brianna, or Marsali, wisely desisted after a quick glance at the tray by the bed to see that I actually had eaten something.

â€œTell me whatâ€™s happened,â€ I said, settling and bracing myself. â€œWhoâ€™s been ill? How are they? And whoâ€”â€ I cleared my throat. â€œWhoâ€™s died?â€

He narrowed his eyes at me, obviously trying to guess whether I would faint, die, or leap out of bed if he told me.

â€œYeâ€™re sure ye feel well enough, Sassenach?â€ he asked dubiously. â€œItâ€™s news that wilna spoil with keeping.â€

â€œNo, but I have to hear sooner or later, donâ€™t I? And knowing is better than worrying about what I donâ€™t know.â€

He nodded, taking the point, and took a deep breath.

â€œAye, then. Padraic and his daughter are well on the mend. Evanâ€”heâ€™s lost his youngest, wee Bobby, and Grace is still ill, but Hugh and Caitlin didna fall sick at all.â€ He swallowed, and went on. â€œThree of the fisher-folk have died; thereâ€™s maybe a dozen still ailing, but most are on the mend.â€ He knit his brows, considering. â€œAnd then thereâ€™s Tom Christie. Heâ€™s still bad, I hear.â€

â€œIs he? Malva didnâ€™t mention it.â€ But then, Malva had refused to tell me anything when Iâ€™d asked earlier, insisting that I must just rest, and not worry myself.

â€œWhat about Allan?â€

â€œNo, heâ€™s fine,â€ Jamie assured me.

â€œHow long has Tom been sick?â€

â€œI dinna ken. The lass can tell ye.â€

I noddedâ€”a mistake, as the light-headedness had not left me yet, and I was obliged to shut my eyes and let my head fall back, illuminated patterns flashing behind my lids.

â€œThatâ€™s very odd,â€ I said, a little breathlessly, hearing Jamie start up in response to my small collapse. â€œWhen I close my eyes, often I see starsâ€”but not like stars in the sky. They look just like the stars on the lining of a dollâ€™s suitcaseâ€”a portmanteau, I meanâ€”that I had as a child. Why do you suppose that is?â€

â€œI havena got the slightest idea.â€ There was a rustle as he sat back down on the stool. â€œYeâ€™re no still delirious, are ye?â€ he asked dryly.

â€œShouldnâ€™t think so. Was I delirious?â€ Breathing deeply and carefully, I opened my eyes and gave him my best attempt at a smile.

â€œYe were.â€

â€œDo I want to know what I said?â€

The corner of his mouth twitched.

â€œProbably not, but I may tell ye sometime, anyway.â€

I considered closing my eyes and floating off to sleep, rather than contemplate future embarrassments, but rallied. If I was going to liveâ€”and I wasâ€”I needed to gather up the strands of life that tethered me to the earth, and reattach them.

â€œBreeâ€™s family, and Marsaliâ€™sâ€”theyâ€™re all right?â€ I asked only for formâ€™s sake; both Bree and Marsali had come to hover anxiously over my prostrate form, and while neither one would tell me anything they thought might upset me in my weakened condition, I was reasonably sure that neither one could have kept it secret if the children were seriously ill.

â€œAye,â€ he said slowly, â€œaye, theyâ€™re fine.â€

â€œWhat?â€ I said, picking up the hesitation in his voice.

â€œTheyâ€™re fine,â€ he repeated quickly. â€œNone of them has fallen ill at all.â€

I gave him a cold look, though careful not to move too much while doing it.

â€œYou may as well tell me,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™ll get it out of Mrs. Bug if you donâ€™t.â€

As though mention of her name had invoked her, I heard the distinctive thump of Mrs. Bugâ€™s clogs on the stair, approaching. She was moving more slowly than usual, and with a care suggesting that she was laden with something.

This proved to be true; she negotiated sideways through the door, beaming, a loaded tray in one hand, the other wrapped round Henri-Christian, who clung to her, monkeylike.

â€œIâ€™ve brought ye a wee bit to eat, a leannan,â€ she said briskly, nudging the barely touched bowl of parritch and plate of cold toast aside to make room for the fresh provisions. â€œYeâ€™re no catching, are ye?â€

Barely waiting for my shake of the head, she leaned over the bed and gently decanted Henri-Christian into my arms. Undiscriminatingly friendly as always, he butted his head under my chin, nuzzled into my chest, and began mouthing my knuckles, his sharp little baby teeth making small dents in my skin.

â€œHallo, whatâ€™s happened here?â€ I frowned, smoothing the soft brown licks of baby hair off his rounded brow, where the yellowing stain of an ugly bruise showed at his hairline.

â€œThe spawn of the deâ€™il tried to kill the poor wean,â€ Mrs. Bug informed me, mouth pulled tight. â€œAnd would have done, too, save for Roger Mac, bless him.â€

â€œOh? Which spawn was this?â€ I asked, familiar with Mrs. Bugâ€™s methods of description.

â€œSome of the fishersâ€™ weans,â€ Jamie said. He put out a finger and touched Henri-Christianâ€™s nose, snatched it away as the baby grabbed for it, then touched his nose again. Henri-Christian giggled and grabbed his own nose, entranced by the game.

â€œThe wicked creatures tried to drown him,â€ Mrs. Bug amplified. â€œStole the puir wee laddie in his basket and set him adrift in the creek!â€

â€œI shouldna think they meant to drown him,â€ Jamie said mildly, still absorbed in the game. â€œIf so, they wouldna have troubled wiâ€™ the basket, surely.â€

â€œHmph!â€ was Mrs. Bugâ€™s response to this piece of logic. â€œThey didna mean to do him any good,â€ she added darkly.

I had been taking a quick inventory of Henri-Christianâ€™s physique, finding several more healing bruises, a small scabbed cut on one heel, and a scraped knee.

â€œWell, youâ€™ve been bumped about a bit, havenâ€™t you?â€ I said to him.

â€œUmp. Heeheehee!â€ said Henri-Christian, vastly entertained by my explorations.

â€œRoger saved him?â€ I asked, glancing up at Jamie.

He nodded, one side of his mouth turning up a little.

â€œAye. I didna ken what was going on, â€™til wee Joanie rushed up to me, shouting as theyâ€™d taken her brotherâ€”but I got there in time to see the end of the matter.â€

The boys had set the babyâ€™s basket afloat in the trout pool, a wide, deep spot in the creek, where the water was fairly quiet. Made of stoutly woven reeds, the basket had floatedâ€”long enough for the current to push it toward the outfall from the pool, where the water ran swiftly through a stretch of rocks, before plunging over a three-foot fall, down into a tumbling churn of water and boulders.

Roger had been building a rail fence, within earshot of the creek. Hearing boys shouting and FÃ©licitÃ©â€™s steam-whistle shrieks, he had dropped the rail he was holding and rushed down the hill, thinking that she was being tormented.

Instead, he had burst from the trees just in time to see Henri-Christian, in his basket, tip slowly over the edge of the outfall and start bumping crazily from rock to rock, spinning in the current and taking on water.

Running down the bank and launching himself in a flat dive, Roger had landed full-length in the creek just below the fall, in time for Henri-Christian, bawling with terror, to drop from his sodden basket, plummet down the fall, and land on Roger, who grabbed him.

â€œI was just in time to see it,â€ Jamie informed me, grinning at the memory. â€œAnd then to see Roger Mac rise out oâ€™ the water like a triton, wiâ€™ duckweed streaming from his hair, blood runninâ€™ from his nose, and the wee lad clutched tight in his arms. A terrible sight, he was.â€

The miscreant boys had followed the basketâ€™s career, yelling along the banks, but were now struck dumb. One of them moved to flee, the others starting up like a flight of pigeons, but Roger had pointed an awful finger at them and bellowed, â€œSheas!â€ in a voice loud enough to be heard over the racket of the creek.

Such was the force of his presence, they did stay, frozen in terror.

Holding them with his glare, Roger had waded almost to the shore. There, he squatted and cupped a handful of water, which he poured over the head of the shrieking babyâ€”who promptly quit shrieking.

â€œI baptize thee, Henri-Christian,â€ Roger had bellowed, in his hoarse, cracked voice. â€œIn the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost! Dâ€™ye hear me, wee bastards? His name is Christian! He belongs to the Lord! Trouble him again, ye lot of scabs, and Satan will pop up and drag ye straight down screamingâ€”TO HELL!â€

He stabbed an accusing finger once more at the boys, who this time did break and run, scampering wildly into the brush, pushing and falling in their urge to escape.

â€œOh, dear,â€ I said, torn between laughter and dismay. I looked down at Henri-Christian, who had lately discovered the joys of thumb-sucking and was absorbed in further study of the art. â€œThat must have been impressive.â€

â€œIt impressed me, to be sure,â€ Jamie said, still grinning. â€œIâ€™d no notion Roger Mac had it in him to preach hellfire and damnation like that. The ladâ€™s a great roar to him, cracked voice and all. Heâ€™d have a good audience, did he do it for a Gathering, aye?â€

â€œWell, that explains what happened to his voice,â€ I said. â€œI wondered. Do you think it was only mischief, though? Them putting the baby in the creek?â€

â€œOh, it was mischief, sure enough,â€ he said, and cupped a big hand gently round Henri-Christianâ€™s head. â€œNot just boysâ€™ mischief, though.â€

Jamie had caught one of the fleeing boys as they hurtled past him, grabbing him by the neck and quite literally scaring the piss out of the lad. Walking the boy firmly into the wood, heâ€™d pinned him hard against a tree and demanded to know the meaning of this attempted murder.

Trembling and blubbering, the boy had tried to excuse it, saying that they hadnâ€™t meant any harm to the wean, truly! Theyâ€™d only wanted to see him floatâ€”for their parents all said he was demon-born, and everyone kent that those born of Satan floated, because the water would reject their wickedness. Theyâ€™d taken the baby in his basket and put that into the water, because they were afraid to touch him, fearing his flesh would burn them.

â€œI told him Iâ€™d burn him myself,â€ Jamie said with a certain grimness, â€œand did.â€ Heâ€™d then dismissed the smarting lad, with instructions to go home, change his breeks, and inform his confederates that they were expected in Jamieâ€™s study before supper to receive their own share of retributionâ€”or else Himself would be coming round to their houses after supper, to thrash them before their parentsâ€™ eyes.

â€œDid they come?â€ I asked, fascinated.

He gave me a look of surprise.

â€œOf course. They took their medicine, and then we went to the kitchen and had bread and honey. Iâ€™d told Marsali to bring the wee lad, and after weâ€™d eaten, I took him on my knee, and had them all come and touch him, just to see.â€

He smiled lopsidedly.

â€œOne of the lads asked me was it true, what Mr. Roger said, about the wean belonging to the Lord? I told him I certainly wouldna argue with Mr. Roger about thatâ€”but whoever else he belonged to, Henri-Christian belongs to me, as well, and best they should remember it.â€

His finger trailed slowly down Henri-Christianâ€™s round, smooth cheek. The baby was nearly asleep now, heavy eyelids closing, a tiny, glistening thumb half in, half out of his mouth.

â€œIâ€™m sorry I missed that,â€ I said softly, so as not to wake him. Heâ€™d grown much warmer, as sleeping babies did, and heavy in the curve of my arm. Jamie saw that I was having difficulty holding him, and took him from me, handing him back to Mrs. Bug, who had been bustling quietly round the room, tidying, all the while listening with approval to Jamieâ€™s account.

â€œOh, â€™twas something to see,â€ she assured me in a whisper, patting Henri-Christianâ€™s back as she took him. â€œAnd the lads all poking their fingers out to touch the bairnieâ€™s wee belly, gingerlike, as if they meant to prod a hot potato, and him squirminâ€™ and giggling like a worm wiâ€™ the fits. The wicked little gomerelsâ€™ eyes were big as sixpences!â€

â€œI imagine they were,â€ I said, amused.

â€œOn the other hand,â€ I remarked sotto voce to Jamie as she left with the baby, â€œif their parents think heâ€™s demon-born, and youâ€™re his grandfather . . .â€

â€œWell, youâ€™re his grannie, Sassenach,â€ Jamie said dryly. â€œIt might be you. But aye, Iâ€™d prefer not to have them dwell on that aspect of the matter.â€

â€œNo,â€ I agreed. â€œThoughâ€”do any of them know, do you think, that Marsali isnâ€™t your daughter by blood? They must know about Fergus.â€

â€œIt wouldna much matter,â€ he said. â€œThey think wee Henriâ€™s a changeling, in any case.â€

â€œHow do you know that?â€

â€œPeople talk,â€ he said briefly. â€œAre ye feeling well in yourself, Sassenach?â€

Relieved of the babyâ€™s weight, I had put back the covers a bit to let in air. Jamie stared at me in disapproval.

â€œChrist, I can count all your ribs! Right through your shift!â€

â€œEnjoy the experience while you can,â€ I advised him tartly, though I felt a sharp pang of hurt. He seemed to sense this, for he took my hand, tracing the lines of the deep blue veins that ran across the back of it.

â€œDinna fash yourself, Sassenach,â€ he said, more gently. â€œI didna mean it that way. Here, Mrs. Bugâ€™s brought ye something tasty, I expect.â€ He lifted the lid off a small covered dish, frowned at the substance in it, then stuck a cautious finger in and licked it.

â€œMaple pudding,â€ he announced, looking happy.

â€œOh?â€ I had no appetite at all yet, but maple pudding sounded at least innocuous, and I made no objection as he scooped up a spoonful, guiding it toward my mouth with the concentration of a man flying an airliner.

â€œI can feed myself, you knâ€”â€ He slipped the spoon between my lips, and I resignedly sucked the pudding off it. Amazing revelations of creamy sweetness immediately exploded in my mouth, and I closed my eyes in minor ecstasy, recalling.

â€œOh, God,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™d forgotten what good food tastes like.â€

â€œI knew ye hadnâ€™t been eating,â€ he said with satisfaction. â€œHere, have more.â€

I insisted upon taking the spoon myself, and managed half the dish; Jamie ate the other half, at my urging.

â€œYou may not be as thin as I am,â€ I said, turning my hand over and grimacing at the sight of my protruding wrist bones, â€œbut you havenâ€™t been eating a lot, either.â€

â€œI suppose not.â€ He scraped the spoon carefully round the bowl, retrieving the last bits of pudding, and sucked the spoon clean. â€œItâ€™s been . . . busy.â€

I watched him narrowly. He was being patently cheerful, but my rusty sensibilities were beginning to come back. For some unknowable span of time, Iâ€™d had neither energy nor attention for anything that lay outside the fever-racked shell of my body; now I was seeing the small familiarities of Jamieâ€™s body, voice and manner, and becoming reattuned to him, like a slack violin string being tightened in the presence of a tuning fork.

I could feel the vibration of some strain in him, and I was beginning to think it wasnâ€™t all due to my recent near-demise.

â€œWhat?â€ I said.

â€œWhat?â€ He raised his eyebrows in question, but I knew him too well for that. The question alone gave me confidence that I was right.

â€œWhat arenâ€™t you telling me?â€ I asked, with what patience I could muster. â€œIs it Brown again? Have you got news of Stephen Bonnet? Or Donner? Or has the white sow eaten one of the children and choked to death?â€

That made him smile, at least, though only for a moment.

â€œNot that,â€ he said. â€œShe went for MacDonald, when he called a few days ago, but he made it onto the porch in time. Verra agile the Major is, for a man of his age.â€

â€œHeâ€™s younger than you are,â€ I objected.

â€œWell, Iâ€™m agile, too,â€ he said logically. â€œThe sow hasna got me yet, has she?â€

I felt a qualm of unease at his mention of the Major, but it wasnâ€™t news of political unrest or military rumblings that was troubling Jamie; he would have told me that at once. I narrowed my eyes at him again, but didnâ€™t speak.

He sighed deeply.

â€œI am thinking I must send them away,â€ he said quietly, and took my hand again.

â€œSend who away?â€

â€œFergus and Marsali and the weans.â€

I felt a sharp, sudden jolt, as though someone had struck me just below the breastbone, and found it suddenly difficult to draw breath.

â€œWhat? Why? Andâ€”and where?â€ I managed to ask.

He rubbed his thumb lightly over my knuckles, back and forth, his eyes focused on the small motion.

â€œFergus tried to kill himself, three days ago,â€ he said very quietly.

My hand gripped his convulsively.

â€œHoly God,â€ I whispered. He nodded, and I saw that he was unable to speak for the moment; his teeth were set in his lower lip.

Now it was I who took his hand in both of mine, feeling coldness seep through my flesh. I wanted to deny it, reject the notion utterlyâ€”but couldnâ€™t. It sat there between us, an ugly thing like a poisonous toad that neither of us wished to touch.

â€œHow?â€ I said at last. My voice seemed to echo in the room. I wanted to say, â€œAre you sure?â€ but I knew he was.

â€œWith a knife,â€ he replied literally. The corner of his mouth twitched again, but not with humor. â€œHe said he would have hanged himself, but he couldna tie the rope with one hand. Lucky, that.â€

The pudding had formed a small, hard ball, like rubber, that lay in the bottom of my stomach.

â€œYou . . . found him? Or was it Marsali?â€

He shook his head.

â€œShe doesna ken. Or rather, I expect she does, but sheâ€™s no admitting itâ€”to either of them.â€

â€œHe canâ€™t have been badly wounded, then, or sheâ€™d have to know for sure.â€ My chest still hurt, but the words were coming more easily.

â€œNo. I saw him go past, whilst I was scraping a deerâ€™s hide up on the hill. He didna see me, and I didna call outâ€”I dinna ken what it was that struck me queer about him . . . but something did. I went on wiâ€™ my work for a bitâ€”I didna want to go far from the house, in caseâ€”but it niggled at me.â€ He let go of my hand and rubbed his knuckles underneath his nose.

â€œI couldna seem to let go of the thought that something was amiss, and finally I put down my work and went after him, thinking myself all kinds of a fool for it.â€

Fergus had headed over the end of the Ridge, and down the wooded slope that led to the White Spring. This was the most remote and secluded of the three springs on the Ridge, called â€œwhiteâ€ because of the large pale boulder that stood near the head of the pool.

Jamie had come down through the trees in time to see Fergus lie down by the spring, sleeve rolled up and coat folded beneath his head, and submerge his handless left arm in the water.

â€œI should maybe haâ€™ shouted then,â€ he said, rubbing a distracted hand through his hair. â€œBut I couldna really believe it, ken?â€

Then Fergus had taken a small boning knife in his right hand, reached down into the pool, and neatly opened the veins of his left elbow, blood blooming in a soft, dark cloud around the whiteness of his arm.

â€œI shouted then,â€ Jamie said. He closed his eyes, and scrubbed his hands hard over his face, as though trying to erase the memory of it.

He had run down the hill, grabbed Fergus, jerked him to his feet, and hit him.

â€œYou hit him?â€

â€œI did,â€ he said shortly. â€œHeâ€™s lucky I didna break his neck, the wee bastard.â€ Color had begun to rise in his face as he talked, and he pressed his lips tight together.

â€œWas this after the boys took Henri-Christian?â€ I asked, my memory of the conversation in the stable with Fergus vividly in mind. â€œI meanâ€”â€

â€œAye, I ken what ye mean,â€ he interrupted. â€œAnd it was the day after the lads put Henri-Christian in the creek, aye. It wasna only that, thoughâ€”not only all the trouble over the wee laddie being a dwarf, I mean.â€ He glanced at me, his face troubled.

â€œWe talked. After Iâ€™d bound up his arm and brought him round. He said heâ€™d been thinking of it for some time; the thing wiâ€™ the bairn only pushed him into it.â€

â€œBut . . . how could he?â€ I said, distressed. â€œTo leave Marsali, and the childrenâ€”how?â€

Jamie looked down, hands braced on his knees, and sighed. The window was open, and a soft breeze came in, lifting the hairs on the crown of his head like tiny flames.

â€œHe thought they would do better without him,â€ he said flatly. â€œIf he was dead, Marsali could wed againâ€”find a man who could care for her and the weans. Provide for them. Protect wee Henri.â€

â€œHe thinksâ€”thoughtâ€”he couldnâ€™t?â€

Jamie glanced sharply at me.

â€œSassenach,â€ he said, â€œhe kens damn well he canâ€™t.â€

I drew breath to protest this, but bit my lip instead, finding no immediate rebuttal.

Jamie stood up and moved restlessly about the room, picking things up and putting them down.

â€œWould you do such a thing?â€ I asked, after a bit. â€œIn the same circumstances, I mean.â€

He paused for a moment, his back to me, hand on my hairbrush.

â€œNo,â€ he said softly. â€œBut itâ€™s a hard thing for a man to live with.â€

â€œWell, I see that . . .â€ I began, slowly, but he swung round to face me. His own face was strained, filled with a weariness that had little to do with lack of sleep.

â€œNo, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œYe donâ€™t.â€ He spoke gently, but with such a tone of despair in his voice that tears came to my eyes.

It was as much sheer physical weakness as emotional distress, but I knew that if I gave way to it, the end would be complete soggy disintegration, and no one needed that just now. I bit my lip hard and wiped my eyes with the edge of the sheet.

I heard the thump as he knelt down beside me, and I reached out blindly for him, pulling his head against my breast. He put his arms round me and sighed deeply, his breath warm on my skin through the linen of my shift. I stroked his hair with one trembling hand, and felt him give way suddenly, all the tension going out of him like water running from a jug.

I had the oddest feeling, thenâ€”as though the strength he had clung to had now been let go . . . and was flowing into me. My tenuous grip on my own body firmed as I held his, and my heart ceased wavering, taking up instead its normal solid, tireless beating.

The tears had retreated, though they were precariously near the surface. I traced the lines of his face with my fingers, ruddy bronze and lined with sun and care; the high forehead with its thick auburn brows, and the broad planes of his cheek, the long straight nose, straight as a blade. The closed eyes, slanted and mysterious with those odd lashes of his, blond at the root, so deep an auburn at the tips as to seem almost black.

â€œDonâ€™t you know?â€ I said very softly, tracing the small, neat line of his ear. Tiny, stiff blond hairs sprouted in a tiny whorl from the tagus, tickling my finger. â€œDonâ€™t any of you know? That itâ€™s you. Not what you can give, or do, or provide. Just you.â€

He took a deep, shuddering breath, and nodded, though he didnâ€™t open his eyes.

â€œI know. I said that to him, to Fergus,â€ he said very softly. â€œOr at least I think I did. I said a terrible lot of things.â€

They had knelt together by the spring, embracing, wet with blood and water, locked together as though he could hold Fergus to the earth, to his family, by force of will alone, and he had no notion at all what he had said, lost in the passion of the momentâ€”until the end.

â€œYou must continue, for their sakesâ€”though you would not for your own,â€ he had whispered, Fergusâ€™s face pressed into his shoulder, the black hair wet with sweat and water, cold against his cheek. â€œTu comprends, mon enfant, mon fils? Comprends-tu?â€

I felt his throat move as he swallowed.

â€œSee, I kent ye were dying,â€ he said very softly. â€œI was sure yeâ€™d be gone when I came back to the house, and I should be alone. I wasna speaking to Fergus then, I think, so much as to myself.â€

He raised his head then, and looked at me through a blur of tears and laughter.

â€œOh, God, Claire,â€ he said, â€œI would have been so angry, if yeâ€™d died and left me!â€

I wanted to laugh or cry, or both, myselfâ€”and had I still harbored regrets regarding the loss of eternal peace, I would have surrendered them now without hesitation.

â€œI didnâ€™t,â€ I said, and touched his lip. â€œI wonâ€™t. Or at least Iâ€™ll try not.â€ I slid my hand behind his head and drew him back to me. He was a good deal larger and heavier than Henri-Christian, but I felt I could hold him forever, if necessary.

It was early afternoon, and the light just beginning to shift, slanting in through the tops of the west-facing windows so that the room filled with a clean, bright light that glowed on Jamieâ€™s hair and the worn creamy linen of his shirt. I could feel the knobs at the top of his spine, and the yielding flesh in the narrow channel between shoulder blade and backbone.

â€œWhere will you send them?â€ I asked, and tried to smooth the whorled hair of the cowlick on his crown.

â€œTo Cross Creek, maybeâ€”or to Wilmington,â€ he replied. His eyes were half-closed, watching the shadows of leaves flicker on the side of the armoire he had built me. â€œWherever seems best for the printing trade.â€

He shifted a little, tightening his grip on my buttocks, then frowned.

â€œChrist, Sassenach, ye havena got any bum left at all!â€

â€œWell, never mind,â€ I said with resignation. â€œIâ€™m sure that will grow back soon enough.â€

MOMENT OF DECLARATION




JAMIE MET THEM near Woolamâ€™s Mill, five men on horseback. Two were strangers; two were men from Salisbury that he knewâ€”ex-Regulators named Green and Wherry; avid Whigs. The last was Richard Brown, whose face was cold, save for his eyes.

He silently cursed his love of conversation. If not for that, he would have parted from MacDonald as usual, at Coopersville. But they had been talking of poetryâ€”poetry, for Godâ€™s sake!â€”and amusing each other in declamation. Now here he stood in the empty road, holding two horses, while MacDonald, whose guts were in disagreement with him, busied himself deep in the wood.

Amos Green tipped him a nod, and would have passed, but Kitman Wherry reined up; the strangers did likewise, staring curiously.

â€œWhere are Thou bound, friend James?â€ Wherry, a Quaker, asked pleasantly. â€œDoes Thee come to the meeting at Halifax? For Thee are welcome to ride with us, and that be so.â€

Halifax. He felt a trickle of sweat run down the crease of his back. The meeting of the Committee of Correspondence to elect delegates to the Continental Congress.

â€œI am seeing a friend upon his road,â€ he replied courteously, with a nod toward MacDonaldâ€™s horse. â€œI will follow, though; perhaps I shall catch ye up along the way.â€ Fat chance of that, he thought, carefully not looking at Brown.

â€œIâ€™d not be so sure of your welcome, Mr. Fraser.â€ Green spoke civilly enough, but with a certain coldness in his manner that made Wherry glance at him in surprise. â€œNot after what happened in Cross Creek.â€

â€œOh? And would ye see an innocent man burnt alive, or tarred and feathered?â€ The last thing he wished was an argument, but something must be said.

One of the strangers spat in the road.

â€œNot so innocent, if thatâ€™s Fogarty Simms youâ€™re speakinâ€™ of. Little Tory pissant,â€ he added as an afterthought.

â€œThatâ€™s the fellow,â€ Green said, and spat in agreement. â€œThe committee in Cross Creek set out to teach him a lesson; seems Mr. Fraser here was in disagreement. Quite a scene it was, from what I hear,â€ he drawled, leaning back a little in his saddle to survey Jamie from his superior height. â€œLike I said, Mr. Fraserâ€”you ainâ€™t all that popular, right this minute.â€

Wherry was frowning, glancing to and fro between Jamie and Green. â€œTo save a man from tar and feathers, no matter what his politics, seems no more than common humanity,â€ he said sharply.

Brown laughed unpleasantly.

â€œMight seem so to you, I reckon. Not to other folk. You know a man by the company he keeps. And beyond that, thereâ€™s your auntie, eh?â€ he said, redirecting his speech to Jamie. â€œAnd the famous Mrs. MacDonald. I read that speech she gaveâ€”in the final edition of Simmsâ€™s newspaper,â€ he added, repeating the unpleasant laugh.

â€œMy auntâ€™s guests have naught to do wiâ€™ me,â€ Jamie said, striving for simple matter-of-factness.

â€œNo? How â€™bout your auntâ€™s husbandâ€”your uncle, would he be?â€

â€œDuncan?â€ His incredulity plainly showed in his voice, for the strangers exchanged glances, and their manner relaxed a little. â€œNo, heâ€™s my auntâ€™s fourth husbandâ€”and a friend. Why dâ€™ye speak of him?â€

â€œWhy, Duncan Innes is cheek-by-jowl with Farquard Campbell, and a good many other Loyalists. The two of â€™em have been putting money enough to float a ship into pamphlets preachinâ€™ reconciliation with Mother England. Surprised you didnâ€™t know that, Mr. Fraser.â€

Jamie was not merely surprised but thunderstruck at this revelation, but hid it.

â€œA manâ€™s opinions are his own,â€ he said with a shrug. â€œDuncan must do as he likes, and I shall do the same.â€

Wherry was nodding agreement with this, but the others were regarding him with expressions ranging from skepticism to hostility.

Wherry was not unaware of his companionsâ€™ responses.

â€œWhat is thy opinion, then, friend?â€ he asked politely.

Well, heâ€™d known it was coming. Had now and then tried to imagine the circumstances of his declaration, in situations ranging from the vaingloriously heroic to the openly dangerous, but as usual in such matters, Godâ€™s sense of humor trumped all imagination. And so he found himself taking that final step into irrevocable and public commitment to the rebel causeâ€”just incidentally being required to ally himself with a deadly enemy in the processâ€”standing alone in a dusty road, with a uniformed officer of the Crown squatting in the bushes directly behind him, breeches round his ankles.

â€œI am for liberty,â€ he said, in a tone indicating mild astonishment that there could be any question regarding his position.

â€œAre you so?â€ Green looked hard at him, then lifted his chin in the direction of MacDonaldâ€™s horse, where MacDonaldâ€™s regimental sword hung from the saddle, gilt and tassels gleaming in the sun. â€œHow come you to be in company with a redcoat, then?â€

â€œHe is a friend,â€ Jamie replied evenly.

â€œA redcoat?â€ One of the strangers reared back in his saddle as though stung by a bee. â€œHow come redcoats here?â€ The man sounded flabbergasted, and looked hastily to and fro, as though expecting a company of the creatures to burst from the wood, muskets firing.

â€œOnly the one, so far as I know,â€ Brown assured him. â€œNameâ€™s MacDonald. Heâ€™s not a real soldier; retired on half-pay, works for the Governor.â€

His companion didnâ€™t seem noticeably reassured.

â€œWhat are you doing with this MacDonald?â€ he demanded of Jamie.

â€œAs I saidâ€”he is a friend.â€ The attitude of the men had changed in an instant, from skepticism and mild hostility to open offense.

â€œHeâ€™s the Governorâ€™s spy, is what he is,â€ Green declared flatly.

This was no more than the truth, and Jamie was reasonably sure that half the backcountry knew it; MacDonald made no effort to hide either his appearance nor his errands. To deny the fact was to ask them to believe Jamie a dunce, duplicitous, or both.

There was a stirring among the men now, glances exchanged, and the smallest of motions, hands touching knife hilts and pistol grips.

Very fine, Jamie thought. Not satisfied with the irony of the situation, God had now decided that he should fight to the death against the allies he had declared himself to moments earlier, in defense of an officer of the Crown he had just declared himself against.

As his son-in-law was fond of remarkingâ€”great.

â€œBring him out,â€ Brown ordered, nudging his horse to the forefront. â€œWeâ€™ll see what he has to say for himself, this friend of yours.â€

â€œAnd then might be weâ€™ll learn him a lesson he can carry back to the Governor, eh?â€ One of the strangers took off his hat and tucked it carefully beneath the edge of his saddle, preparing.

â€œWait!â€ Wherry drew himself up, trying to quell them with a hand, though Jamie could have told him he was several minutes past the point where such an attempt might have had any effect. â€œYou cannot lay violent hands uponâ€”â€

â€œCanâ€™t we, though?â€ Brown grinned like a deathâ€™s head, eyes fixed on Jamie, and began to undo the leather quirt coiled and fastened to his saddle. â€œNo tar to hand, alas. But a good beating, say, and send â€™em both squealing home to the Governor stark nakedâ€”thatâ€™d answer.â€

The second stranger laughed, and spat again, so the gob landed juicily at Jamieâ€™s feet.

â€œAye, thatâ€™ll do. Hear you held off a mob by yourself in Cross Creek, Fraserâ€”only five to two now, how you like them odds?â€

Jamie liked them fine. Dropping the reins he held, he turned and flung himself between the two horses, screeching and slapping hard at their flanks, then dived headlong into the brush at the roadside, scrabbling through roots and stones on hands and knees as fast as he could.

Behind him, the horses were rearing and wheeling, whinnying loudly and spreading confusion and fright through the other menâ€™s mounts; he could hear cries of anger and alarm, as they tried to gain control of the plunging horses.

He slid down a short slope, dirt and uprooted plants spraying up around his feet, lost his balance and fell at the bottom, bounded up and dashed into an oak copse, where he plastered himself behind a screen of saplings, breathing hard.

Someone had had witâ€”or furyâ€”enough to jump off his horse and follow on foot; he could hear crashing and cursing near at hand, over the fainter cries of the commotion on the road. Glancing cautiously through the leaves, he saw Richard Brown, disheveled and hatless, looking wildly round, pistol in hand.

Any thought he might have had of confrontation vanished; he was unarmed, save a small knife in his stocking, and it was clear to him that Brown would shoot him instantly, claiming self-defense when the others eventually caught up.

Up the slope, toward the road, he caught a glimpse of red. Brown, turning in the same direction, saw it, too, and fired. Whereupon Donald MacDonald, having thoughtfully hung up his coat in a tree, stepped out of cover behind Richard Brown in his shirtsleeves, and hit Brown over the head with a solid length of tree branch.

Brown fell on his knees, momentarily stunned, and Jamie slipped out of the copse, beckoning to MacDonald, who ran heavily to meet him. Together they made their way deeper into the forest, waiting by a stream until prolonged silence from the road indicated that it might be safe to go back for a look.

The men were gone. So was MacDonaldâ€™s horse. Gideon, the whites of his eyes showing and ears laid flat, rolled back his upper lip and squealed fiercely at them, big yellow teeth bared and slobber flying. Brown and company had wisely thought twice about stealing a rabid horse, but had tied him up to a tree and managed to spoil his harness, which hung in bits around his neck. MacDonaldâ€™s sword lay in the dust, torn from its scabbard, blade broken in two.

MacDonald picked up the pieces, viewed them for a moment, then, shaking his head, tucked them through his belt.

â€œDâ€™ye think Jones could mend it?â€ he asked. â€œOr better to go down to Salisbury?â€

â€œWilmington or New Bern,â€ Jamie said, wiping a hand across his mouth. â€œDai Jones hasna the skill to mend a sword, but yeâ€™ll find few friends in Salisbury, from what I hear.â€ Salisbury had been at the heart of the Regulation, and antigovernment sentiment still ran high there. His own heart had gone back to its usual way of beating, but he still felt weak-kneed in the aftermath of flight and anger.

MacDonald nodded bleakly, then glanced at Gideon.

â€œIs yon thing safe to ride?â€

â€œNo.â€

In Gideonâ€™s present state of agitation, Jamie wouldnâ€™t risk riding him alone, let alone double-mounted and with no bridle. Theyâ€™d left the rope on his saddle, at least. He got a loop over the stallionâ€™s head without being bitten, and they set off without comment, returning to the Ridge on foot.

â€œVerra unfortunate,â€ MacDonald observed thoughtfully at one point. â€œThat they should have met us together. Dâ€™ye think itâ€™s dished your chances of worming your way into their councils? I should give my left ball to have an eye and an ear in that meeting they spoke of, Iâ€™ll tell ye that for nothing!â€

With a dim sense of wonder, Jamie realized that having made his momentous declaration, overheard by the man whose cause he sought to betray, and then nearly killed by the new allies whose side he sought to upholdâ€”neither side had believed him.

â€œDâ€™ye ever wonder what it sounds like when God laughs, Donald?â€ he asked thoughtfully.

MacDonald pursed his lips and glanced at the horizon, where dark clouds swelled just beyond the shoulder of the mountain.

â€œLike thunder, I imagine,â€ he said. â€œDâ€™ye not think so?â€

Jamie shook his head.

â€œNo. I think itâ€™s a verra small, wee sound indeed.â€

THE DARK RISES




I HEARD ALL THE SOUNDS OF the household below, and the rumble of Jamieâ€™s voice outside, and felt entirely peaceful. I was watching the sun shift and glow on the yellowing chestnut trees outside, when the sound of feet came marching up the stairs, steady and determined.

The door flung open and Brianna came in, wind-tousled and bright-faced, wearing a steely expression. She halted at the foot of my bed, leveled a long forefinger at me, and said, â€œYou are not allowed to die.â€

â€œOh?â€ I said, blinking. â€œI didnâ€™t think I was going to.â€

â€œYou tried!â€ she said, accusing. â€œYou know you did!â€

â€œWell, not to say tried, exactly . . .â€ I began weakly. If I hadnâ€™t exactly tried to die, though, it was true that I hadnâ€™t quite tried not to, and I must have looked guilty, for her eyes narrowed into blue slits.

â€œDonâ€™t you dare do that again!â€ she said, and wheeling in a sweep of blue cloak, stomped out, pausing at the door to say, â€œBecauseIloveyouandIcanâ€™tdowithoutyou,â€ in a strangled voice, before running down the stairs.

â€œI love you too, darling!â€ I called, the always-ready tears coming to my eyes, but there was no reply, save the sound of the front door closing.

Adso, drowsing in a puddle of sun on the counterpane at my feet, opened his eyes a fraction of an inch at the noise, then sank his head back into his shoulders, purring louder.

I lay back on the pillow, feeling a good deal less peaceful, but somewhat more alive. A moment later, I sat up, put back the quilts, and swung my legs out of bed. Adso abruptly quit purring. â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ I told him. â€œIâ€™m not going to keel over; your supply of milk and scraps is perfectly safe. Keep the bed warm for me.â€

I had been up, of course, and even allowed on short, intensely supervised excursions outside. But no one had let me try to go anywhere alone since before I fell ill, and I was reasonably sure they wouldnâ€™t let me do it now.

I therefore stole downstairs in stockinged feet, shoes in hand, and instead of going through the front door, whose hinges squeaked, or through the kitchen, where Mrs. Bug was working, I slipped into my surgery, opened the window, andâ€”having checked to be sure the white sow was not hanging about belowâ€”climbed carefully out.

I felt quite giddy at my escape, a rush of spirits that sustained me for a little way down the path. Thereafter, I was obliged to stop every few hundred feet, sit down, and gasp a bit while my legs recovered their strength. I persevered, though, and at last came to the Christie cabin.

No one was in sight, nor was there any response to my tentative â€œHallo!â€, but when I knocked at the door, I heard Tom Christieâ€™s voice, gruff and dispirited, bid me enter.

He was at the table, writing, but from the looks of him, ought still to have been in bed. His eyes widened in surprise at sight of me, and he hastily tried to straighten the grubby shawl round his shoulders.

â€œMrs. Fraser! Are youâ€”that isâ€”what in the name of God . . .â€ Deprived of speech, he pointed at me, eyes round as saucers. I had taken off my broad-brimmed hat when I entered, forgetting momentarily that I looked like nothing so much as an excited bottle brush.

â€œOh,â€ I said, passing a self-conscious hand over my head. â€œThat. You ought to be pleased; Iâ€™m not going about outraging the public by a wanton display of my flowing locks.â€

â€œYou look like a convict,â€ he said bluntly. â€œSit down.â€

I did, being rather in need of the stool he offered me, owing to the exertions of the walk.

â€œHow are you?â€ I inquired, peering at him. The light in the cabin was very bad; he had been writing with a candle, and had put it out upon my appearance.

â€œHow am I?â€ He seemed both astonished and rather put out at the inquiry. â€œYou have walked all the way here, in a dangerously enfeebled condition, to ask after my health?â€

â€œIf you care to put it that way,â€ I replied, rather nettled by that â€œdangerously enfeebled.â€ â€œI donâ€™t suppose you would care to step out into the light, so that I can get a decent look at you, would you?â€

He drew the ends of the shawl protectively across his chest.

â€œWhy?â€ He frowned at me, peaked brows drawing together so that he looked like an irritable owl.

â€œBecause I want to know a few things regarding your state of health,â€ I replied patiently, â€œand examining you is likely the best way of finding them out, since you donâ€™t seem able to tell me anything.â€

â€œYou are most unaccountable, madam!â€

â€œNo, I am a doctor,â€ I countered. â€œAnd I want to knowâ€”â€ A brief wave of giddiness came over me, and I leaned on the table, holding on â€™til it passed.

â€œYou are insane,â€ he stated, having scrutinized me for a moment. â€œYou are also still ill, I believe. Stay there; I shall call my son to go and fetch your husband.â€

I flapped a hand at him and took a deep breath. My heart was racing, and I was a trifle pale and sweaty, but essentially all right.

â€œThe fact of the matter, Mr. Christie, is that while Iâ€™ve certainly been ill, I wasnâ€™t ill with the same sickness thatâ€™s been afflicting people on the Ridgeâ€”and from what Malva was able to tell me, I donâ€™t think you were, either.â€

He had risen to go and call Allan; at this, he froze, staring at me with his mouth open. Then he slowly lowered himself back into his chair.

â€œWhat do you mean?â€

Having finally got his attention, I was pleased to lay out the facts before him; I had them neatly to hand, having given them considerable thought over the last few days.

While several families on the Ridge had suffered the depredations of amoebic dysentery, I hadnâ€™t. I had had a dangerously high fever, accompanied by dreadful headache andâ€”so far as I could tell from Malvaâ€™s excited accountâ€”convulsions. But it certainly wasnâ€™t dysentery.

â€œAre you certain of this?â€ He was twiddling his discarded quill, frowning.

â€œItâ€™s rather hard to mistake bloody flux for headache and fever,â€ I said tartly. â€œNowâ€”did you have flux?â€

He hesitated a moment, but curiosity got the better of him.

â€œNo,â€ he said. â€œIt was as you sayâ€”a headache fit to split the skull, and fever. A terrible weakness, and . . . and extraordinarily unpleasant dreams. I had no notion that it was not the same illness afflicting the others.â€

â€œNo reason you should, I suppose. You didnâ€™t see any of them. Unlessâ€”did Malva describe the illness to you?â€ I asked only from curiosity, but he shook his head.

â€œI do not wish to hear of such things; she does not tell me. Still, why have you come?â€ He tilted his head to one side, narrowing his eyes. â€œWhat difference does it make whether you and I suffered an ague, rather than a flux? Or anyone else, for that matter?â€ He seemed rather agitated, and got up, moving about the cabin in an unfocused, bumbling sort of way, quite unlike his usual decisive movements.

I sighed, rubbing a hand over my forehead. Iâ€™d got the basic information I came for; explaining why Iâ€™d wanted it was going to be uphill work. I had enough trouble getting Jamie, Young Ian, and Malva to accept the germ theory of disease, and that was with the evidence visible through a microscope to hand.

â€œDisease is catching,â€ I said a little tiredly. â€œIt passes from one person to anotherâ€”sometimes directly, sometimes by means of food or water shared between a sick person and a healthy one. All of the people who had the flux lived near a particular small spring; I have some reason to think that it was the water of that spring that carried the amoebaâ€”that made them ill.

â€œYou and I, thoughâ€”I havenâ€™t seen you in weeks. Nor have I been near anyone else whoâ€™s had the ague. How is it that we should both fall ill of the same thing?â€

He stared at me, baffled and still frowning.

â€œI do not see why two persons cannot fall ill without seeing each other. Certainly I have known such illnesses as you describe: gaol fever, for instance, spreads in close quartersâ€”but surely not all illnesses behave in the same fashion?â€

â€œNo, they donâ€™t,â€ I admitted. I wasnâ€™t in a fit state to try to get across the basic notions of epidemiology or public health, either. â€œItâ€™s possible, for instance, for some diseases to be spread by mosquitoes. Malaria, for one.â€ Some forms of viral meningitis, for anotherâ€”my best guess as to the illness Iâ€™d just recovered from.

â€œDo you recall being bitten by a mosquito any time recently?â€

He stared at me, then uttered a brief sort of bark I took for laughter.

â€œMy dear woman, everyone in this festering climate is bitten repeatedly during the hot weather.â€ He scratched at his beard, as though by reflex.

That was true. Everyone but me and Roger. Now and then, some desperate insect would have a go, but for the most part, we escaped unbitten, even when there were absolute plagues of the creatures and everyone around us was scratching. As a theory, I suspected that blood-drinking mosquitoes had evolved so closely with mankind through the years that Roger and I simply didnâ€™t smell right to them, having come from too far away in time. Brianna and Jemmy, who shared my genetic material but also Jamieâ€™s, were bitten, but not as frequently as most people.

I didnâ€™t recall having been bitten any time recently, but it was possible that I had been and had simply been too busy to notice.

â€œWhy does it matter?â€ Christie asked, seeming now merely baffled.

â€œI donâ€™t know. I justâ€”need to find things out.â€ Iâ€™d also needed both to get away from the house and to make some move to reclaim my life by the most direct means I knewâ€”the practice of medicine. But that wasnâ€™t anything I meant to share with Tom Christie.

â€œHmph,â€ he said. He stood looking down at me, frowning and undecided, then suddenly extended a handâ€”the one I had operated on, I saw; the â€œZâ€ of the incision had faded to a healthy pale pink, and the fingers lay straight.

â€œCome outside, then,â€ he said, resigned. â€œI will see you home, and if ye insist upon asking intrusive and bothersome questions regarding my health along the way, I suppose I cannot stop you.â€

Startled, I took his hand, and found his grip solid and steady, despite the haggard look of his face and the slump of his shoulders.

â€œYou neednâ€™t walk me home,â€ I protested. â€œYou ought to be in bed, by the looks of you!â€

â€œSo should you,â€ he said, leading me to the door with a hand beneath my elbow. â€œBut if ye choose to risk your health and your life by undertaking such inappropriate exertionâ€”why, so can I. Though you must,â€ he added sternly, â€œput on your hat before we go.â€



WE MADE IT BACK to the house, stopping frequently for rest, and arrived panting, dripping with sweat, and generally exhilarated by the adventure. No one had missed me, but Mr. Christie insisted upon delivering me inside, which meant that everyone observed my absence ex post facto, and in the irrational way of people, at once became very annoyed.

I was scolded by everyone in sight, including Young Ian, frog-marched upstairs virtually by the scruff of the neck, and thrust forcibly back into bed, where, I was given to understand, I should be lucky to be given bread and milk for my supper. The most annoying aspect of the whole situation was Thomas Christie, standing at the foot of the stairs with a mug of beer in his hand, watching as I was led off, and wearing the only grin I had ever seen on his hairy face.

â€œWhat in the name of God possessed ye, Sassenach?â€ Jamie jerked back the quilt and gestured peremptorily at the sheets.

â€œWell, I felt quite well, andâ€”â€

â€œWell! Yeâ€™re the color of bad buttermilk, and trembling so ye can scarcelyâ€”here, let me do that.â€ Making snorting noises, he pushed my hands away from the laces of my petticoats, and had them off me in a trice.

â€œHave ye lost your mind?â€ he demanded. â€œAnd to sneak off like that without telling anyone, too! What if yeâ€™d fallen? What if ye got ill again?â€

â€œIf Iâ€™d told anyone, they wouldnâ€™t have let me go out,â€ I said mildly. â€œAnd I am a physician, you know. Surely I can judge my own state of health.â€

He gave me a look, strongly suggesting that he wouldnâ€™t trust me to judge a flower show, but merely gave a louder than usual snort in reply.

He then picked me up bodily, carried me to the bed, and placed me gently into itâ€”but with enough demonstration of restrained strength as to let me know that he would have preferred to drop me from a height.

He then straightened up, giving me a baleful look.

â€œIf ye didna look as though ye were about to faint, Sassenach, I swear I would turn ye over and smack your bum for ye.â€

â€œYou canâ€™t,â€ I said, rather faintly. â€œI havenâ€™t got one.â€ I was in fact a little tired . . . well, to be honest, my heart was beating like a kettledrum, my ears were ringing, and if I didnâ€™t lie down flat at once, I likely would faint. I did lie down, and lay with my eyes closed, feeling the room spin gently round me, like a merry-go-round, complete with flashing lights and hurdy-gurdy music.

Through this confusion of sensations, I dimly sensed hands on my legs, then a pleasant coolness on my heated body. Then something warm and cloudlike enveloped my head, and I flailed my hands about wildly, trying to get it off before I smothered.

I emerged, blinking and panting, to discover that I was naked. I glanced at my pallid, sagging, skeletal remains, and snatched the sheet up over myself. Jamie was bending to collect my discarded gown, petticoat, and jacket from the floor, adding these to the shift he had folded over his arm. He picked up my shoes and stockings and added these to his bag.

â€œYou,â€ he said, pointing a long accusatory finger at me, â€œare going nowhere. You are not allowed to kill yourself, do I make myself clear?â€

â€œOh, so thatâ€™s where Bree gets it,â€ I murmured, trying to stop my head from swimming. I closed my eyes again.

â€œI seem to recall,â€ I said, â€œa certain abbey in France. And a very stubborn young man in ill health. And his friend Murtagh, who took his clothes in order to prevent his getting up and wandering off before he was fit.â€

Silence. I opened one eye. He was standing stock still, the fading light from the window striking sparks in his hair.

â€œWhereupon,â€ I said conversationally, â€œif memory serves, you promptly climbed out a window and decamped. Naked. In the middle of winter.â€

The stiff fingers of his right hand tapped twice against his leg.

â€œI was four-and-twenty,â€ he said at last, sounding gruff. â€œI wasna meant to have any sense.â€

â€œI wouldnâ€™t argue with that for an instant,â€ I assured him. I opened the other eye and fixed him with both. â€œBut you do know why I did it. I had to.â€

He drew a very deep breath, sighed, and set down my clothes. He came and sat down on the bed beside me, making the wooden frame creak and groan beneath his weight.

He picked up my hand, and held it as though it were something precious and fragile. It was, tooâ€”or at least it looked fragile, a delicate construct of transparent skin and the shadow of the bones within it. He ran his thumb gently down the back of my hand, tracing the bones from phalange to ulna, and I felt an odd, small tingle of distant memory; the vision of my own bones, glowing blue through the skin, and Master Raymondâ€™s hands, cupping my inflamed and empty womb, saying to me through the mists of fever, â€œCall him. Call the red man.â€

â€œJamie,â€ I said very softly. Sunlight flashed on the metal of my silver wedding ring. He took hold of it between thumb and forefinger, and slid the little metal circlet gently up and down my finger, so loose that it didnâ€™t even catch on the bony knuckle.

â€œBe careful,â€ I said. â€œI donâ€™t want to lose it.â€

â€œYe wonâ€™t.â€ He folded my fingers closed, his own hand closing large and warm around mine.

He sat silent for a time, and we watched the bar of sun creep slowly across the counterpane. Adso had moved with it, to stay in its warmth, and the light tipped his fur with a soft silver glow, the fine hairs that edged his ears tiny and distinct.

â€œItâ€™s a great comfort,â€ he said at last, â€œto see the sun come up and go down. When I dwelt in the cave, when I was in prison, it gave me hope, to see the light come and go, and know that the world went about its business.â€

He was looking out the window, toward the blue distance where the sky darkened toward infinity. His throat moved a little as he swallowed.

â€œIt gives me the same feeling, Sassenach,â€ he said, â€œto hear ye rustling about in your surgery, rattling things and swearinâ€™ to yourself.â€ He turned his head, then, to look at me, and his eyes held the depths of the coming night.

â€œIf ye were no longer thereâ€”or somewhereâ€”â€ he said very softly, â€œthen the sun would no longer come up or go down.â€ He lifted my hand and kissed it, very gently. He laid it, closed around my ring, upon my chest, rose, and left.



I SLEPT LIGHTLY NOW, no longer flung into the agitated world of fever dreams, nor sucked down into the deep well of oblivion as my body sought the healing of sleep. I didnâ€™t know what had wakened me, but I was awake, quite suddenly, alert and fresh-eyed, with no interval of drowsiness.

The shutters were closed, but the moon was full; soft light striped the bed. I ran a hand over the sheet beside me, lifted my hand far above my head. My arm was a slender pale stem, bloodless and fragile as a toadstoolâ€™s stalk; my fingers flexed gently and spread, a web, a net to catch the dark.

I could hear Jamie breathing, in his accustomed spot on the floor beside the bed.

I brought my arm down, stroked my body lightly with both hands, assessing. A tiny swell of breast, ribs I could count, one, two, three, four, five, and the smooth concavity of my stomach, slung like a hammock between the uprights of my hipbones. Skin, and bones. Not much else.

â€œClaire?â€ There was a stirring in the dark beside the bed, and Jamieâ€™s head rose up, a presence more sensed than seen, so dark was the shadow there by contrast with the moonlight.

A large dark hand groped across the quilt, touched my hip.

â€œAre ye well, a nighean?â€ he whispered. â€œDâ€™ye need anything?â€

He was tired; his head lay on the bed beside me, his breath warm through my shift. If he hadnâ€™t been warm, his touch, his breath, perhaps I wouldnâ€™t have had the courage, but I felt cold and bodiless as the moonlight itself, and so I closed my spectral hand on his and whispered, â€œI need you.â€

He was quite still for a moment, slowly making sense of what Iâ€™d said.

â€œIâ€™ll not trouble your sleep?â€ he said, sounding doubtful. I pulled on his wrist in answer, and he came, rising up from the pool of dark on the floor, the thin lines of moonlight rippling over him like water.

â€œKelpie,â€ I said softly.

He snorted briefly in answer, and awkwardly, gingerly, eased himself beneath the quilt, the mattress giving under his weight.

We lay very shyly together, barely touching. He was breathing shallowly, clearly trying to make as little obtrusion of his presence as possible. Aside from a faint rustling of sheets, the house was silent.

Finally, I felt one large finger nudge gently against my thigh.

â€œI missed ye, Sassenach,â€ he whispered.

I rolled onto my side facing him, and kissed his arm in answer. I wanted to move closer, lay my head in the curve of his shoulder, and lie in the circle of his armâ€”but the idea of my short, bristly hair against his skin kept me from it.

â€œI missed you, too,â€ I said, into the dark solidness of his arm.

â€œWill I take ye, then?â€ he said softly. â€œDâ€™ye want it, truly?â€ One hand caressed my arm; the other went downward, starting the slow, steady rhythm to ready himself.

â€œLet me,â€ I whispered, stilling his hand with my own. â€œLie still.â€

I made love to him at first like a sneak thief, hasty strokes and tiny kisses, stealing scent and touch and warmth and salty taste. Then he put a hand on the back of my neck, pressing me closer, deeper.

â€œDinna hurry yourself, lass,â€ he said in a hoarse whisper. â€œIâ€™m no going anywhere.â€

I let a quiver of silent amusement pass through me and he drew in a deep, deep breath as I closed my teeth very gently round him and slid my hand up under the warm, musky weight of his balls.

Then I rose up over him, light-headed at the sudden movement, needing urgently. We both sighed deeply as it happened, and I felt the breath of his laughter on my breasts as I bent over him.

â€œI missed ye, Sassenach,â€ he whispered again.

I was shy of his touching me, changed as I was, and leaned with my hands on his shoulders, keeping him from pulling me down to him. He didnâ€™t try, but slid his hand curled between us.

I felt a brief pang at the thought that the hair on my privates was longer than that on my headâ€”but the thought was driven out by the slow pressure of the big knuckle pressing deep between my legs, rocking gently back and forth.

I seized his other hand and brought it to my mouth, sucked his fingers hard, one by one, and shuddered, gripping his hand with all my strength.

I was still gripping it sometime later, as I lay beside him. Or rather, holding it, admiring the unseen shapes of it, complex and graceful in the dark, and the hard, smooth layer of callus on palms and knuckles.

â€œIâ€™ve the hands of a bricklayer,â€ he said, laughing a little as I passed my lips lightly over the roughened knuckles and the still-sensitive tips of his long fingers.

â€œCalluses on a manâ€™s hands are deeply erotic,â€ I assured him.

â€œAre they, so?â€ His free hand passed lightly over my shorn head and down the length of my back. I shivered and pressed closer to him, self-consciousness beginning to be forgotten. My own free hand roamed down the length of his body, toying with the soft, wiry bush of his hair, and the damply tender, half-hard cock.

He arched his back a little, then relaxed.

â€œWell, Iâ€™ll tell ye, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œIf I havena got calluses there, itâ€™s no fault of yours, believe me.â€

THE LAST LAUGH




IT WAS AN OLD MUSKET, made perhaps twenty years before, but well-kept. The stock was polished with wear, the wood beautiful to the touch, and the metal of the barrel mellow and clean.

Standing Bear clutched it in ecstasy, running awed fingers up and down the gleaming barrel, bringing them to his nose to sniff the intoxicating perfume of oil and powder, then beckoning his friends to come and smell it, too.

Five gentlemen had received muskets from the beneficent hand of Bird-who-sings-in-the-morning, and a sense of delight ran through the house, spreading in ripples through the village. Bird himself, with twenty-five muskets still to give, was drunk with the sense of inestimable wealth and power, and thus in a mood to welcome anyone and anything.

â€œThis is Hiram Crombie,â€ Jamie said to Bird, in Tsalagi, indicating Mr. Crombie, who had stood by him, white-faced with nerves, throughout the preliminary talk, the presentation of the muskets, the summoning of the braves, and the general rejoicing over the guns. â€œHe has come to offer his friendship, and to tell you stories of the Christ.â€

â€œOh, your Christ? The one who went to the lower world and came back? I always wondered, did he meet Sky-woman there, or Mole? I am fond of Mole; I would like to know what he said.â€ Bird touched the stone pendant at his neck, a small red carving of Mole, the guide to the underworld.

Mr. Crombieâ€™s brow was furrowed, but luckily he had not yet developed any sense of ease in Tsalagi; he was still in the stage of mentally translating each word into English, and Bird was a rapid speaker. And Ian had found no occasion to teach Hiram the word for Mole.

Jamie coughed.

â€œI am sure he will be happy to tell you all the stories he knows,â€ he said. â€œMr. Crombie,â€ he said, switching momentarily to English, â€œTsisqua offers you welcome.â€

Birdâ€™s wife Penstemonâ€™s nostrils flared delicately; Crombie was sweating with nervousness, and smelled like a goat. He bowed earnestly, and presented Bird with the good knife he had brought as a present, slowly reciting the complimentary speech he had committed to memory. Reasonably well, too, Jamie thought; heâ€™d mispronounced only a couple of words.

â€œI come to b-bring you great joy,â€ he finished, stammering and sweating.

Bird looked at Crombieâ€”small, stringy, and dripping wetâ€”for a long, inscrutable moment, then back at Jamie.

â€œYouâ€™re a funny man, Bear-Killer,â€ he said with resignation. â€œLet us eat!â€

It was autumn; the harvest was in and the hunting was good. And so the Feast of the Guns was a notable occasion, with wapiti and venison and wild pig raised steaming from pits and roasted over roaring fires, with overflowing platters of maize and roasted squash and dishes of beans spiced with onion and coriander, dishes of pottage, and dozen upon dozen of small fish rolled in cornmeal, fried in bear grease, their flesh crisp and sweet.

Mr. Crombie, very stiff to begin with, began to unbend under the influence of food, spruce beer, and the flattering attention paid him. A certain amount of the attention, Jamie thought, was due to the fact that Ian, a wide grin on his face, stayed by his pupil for a time, prompting and correcting, â€™til Hiram should feel more at ease in the tongue, and able to manage on his own. Ian was extremely popular, particularly with the young women of the village.

For himself, he enjoyed the feasting very much; relieved of responsibility, there was nothing to do save to talk and listen and eatâ€”and in the morning he would go.

It was an odd feeling, and one he was not sure he had ever had before. He had had many leavetakings, most regretfulâ€”a few taken with a sense of reliefâ€”some that wrenched the heart from his chest and left him aching. Not tonight. Everything seemed strangely ceremonious, something consciously done for the last time, and yet there was no sadness in it.

Completion, he supposed, was the sense of it. He had done what he could do, and now must leave Bird and the others to make their own way. He might come again, but never again by duty, in his role as the agent of the King.

That was a peculiar thought in itself. He had never lived without the consciousness of allegianceâ€”whether willing or not, witting or notâ€”to a king, whether that be German Geordieâ€™s house or the Stuarts. And now he did.

For the first time, he had some glimmer of what his daughter and his wife had tried to tell him.

Hiram was trying to recite one of the psalms, he realized. He was doing a good job of it, because he had asked Ian to translate it, and had then carefully committed it to memory. However . . .

â€œOil runs down over the head and the beard . . .â€

Penstemon cast a wary glance at the small pot of melted bear grease that they were using as a condiment, and narrowed her eyes at Hiram, plainly intending to snatch the dish from him if he tried to pour it over his head.

â€œItâ€™s a story of his ancestors,â€ Jamie said to her, with a brief shrug. â€œNot his own custom.â€

â€œOh. Hm.â€ She relaxed a little, though continuing to keep a close eye on Hiram. He was a guest, but not all guests could be trusted to behave well.

Hiram did nothing untoward, though, and with many protests of sufficiency, and awkward compliments toward his hosts, was persuaded to eat until his eyes bulged, which pleased them.

Ian would stay for a few days, to be sure that Hiram and Birdâ€™s people were in some sort of mutual accord. Jamie was not quite sure that Ianâ€™s sense of responsibility would overcome his sense of humor, thoughâ€”in some ways, Ianâ€™s sense of humor tended toward the Indiansâ€™. A word from Jamie might therefore not come amiss, just by way of precaution.

â€œHe has a wife,â€ Jamie said to Bird, with a nod toward Hiram, now engaged in close discourse with two of the older men. â€œI think he would not welcome a young woman in his bed. He might be rude to her, not understanding the compliment.â€

â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ said Penstemon, overhearing this. She glanced at Hiram, and her lip curled with scorn. â€œNobody would want a child from him. Now, a child from you, Bear-Killer . . .â€ She gave him a long look beneath her lashes, and he laughed, saluting her with a gesture of respect.

It was a perfect night, cold and crisp, and the door was left open that the air might come in. The smoke from the fire rose straight and white, streaming toward the hole above, its moving wraiths like spirits ascending in joy.

Everyone had eaten and drunk to the point of a pleasant stupor, and there was momentary silence and a pervading sense of peace and happiness.

â€œIt is good for men to eat as brothers,â€ Hiram observed to Standing Bear, in his halting Tsalagi. Or rather, tried to. And after all, Jamie reflected, feeling his ribs creak under the strain, it was really a very minor difference between â€œas brothersâ€ and â€œtheir brothers.â€

Standing Bear gave Hiram a thoughtful look, and edged slightly farther away from him.

Bird observed this, and after a momentâ€™s silence, turned to Jamie.

â€œYouâ€™re a very funny man, Bear-Killer,â€ he repeated, shaking his head. â€œYou win.â€

SAVAGES




ONLY TWO LEFT. The pool of liquid wax glowed with the light of the flaming wick above it, and the jewels slowly came into view, one green, one black, glowing with their own inner fire. Jamie dipped the feather end of a quill gently into the melted wax and scooped the emerald up, raising it into the light.

He dropped the hot stone into the handkerchief I held waiting, and I rubbed it quickly, to get off the wax before it should harden.

â€œOur reserves are getting rather low,â€ I said, in uneasy jest. â€œLetâ€™s hope there arenâ€™t any more expensive emergencies.â€

â€œI shallna touch the black diamond, regardless,â€ he said definitely, and blew out the wick. â€œThat one is for you.â€

I stared at him.

â€œWhat do you mean by that?â€

He shrugged a little, and reached to take the emerald in its handkerchief from me.

â€œIf I should be killed,â€ he said very matter-of-factly. â€œYeâ€™ll take it and go. Back through the stones.â€

â€œOh? I donâ€™t know that I would,â€ I said. I didnâ€™t like talking about any contingency that involved Jamieâ€™s death, but there was no point in ignoring the possibilities. Battle, disease, imprisonment, accident, assassination . . .

â€œYou and Bree were going about forbidding me to die,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™d do the same thing, if I had the faintest hope of your paying the least attention.â€

He smiled at that.

â€œI always mind your words, Sassenach,â€ he assured me gravely. â€œBut ye do tell me that man proposes and God disposes, and should He see fit to dispose of meâ€”yeâ€™ll go back.â€

â€œWhy would I?â€ I said, nettledâ€”and unsettled. The memories of his sending me back through the stones on the eve of Culloden were not ones I ever wished to recall, and here he was, prying open the door to that tightly sealed chamber of my mind. â€œIâ€™d stay with Bree and Roger, wouldnâ€™t I? Jem, Marsali and Fergus, Germain and Henri-Christian and the girlsâ€”everyoneâ€™s here. What is there to go back to, after all?â€

He took the stone from its cloth, turning it over between his fingers, and looked thoughtfully at me, as though making up his mind whether to tell me something. Small hairs began to prickle on the back of my neck.

â€œI dinna ken,â€ he said at last, shaking his head. â€œBut Iâ€™ve seen ye there.â€

The prickling ran straight down the back of my neck and down both arms.

â€œSeen me where?â€

â€œThere.â€ He waved a hand in a vague gesture. â€œI dreamt of ye there. I dinna ken where it was; I only know it was thereâ€”in your proper time.â€

â€œHow do you know that?â€ I demanded, my flesh creeping briskly. â€œWhat was I doing?â€

His brow furrowed in the effort of recollection.

â€œI dinna recall, exactly,â€ he said slowly. â€œBut I knew it was then, by the light.â€ His brow cleared suddenly. â€œThatâ€™s it. Ye were sitting at a desk, with something in your hand, maybe writing. And there was light all round ye, shining on your face, on your hair. But it wasna candlelight, nor yet firelight or sunlight. And I recall thinking to myself as I saw ye, Oh, so thatâ€™s what electric light is like.â€

I stared at him, open-mouthed.

â€œHow can you recognize something in a dream that youâ€™ve never seen in real life?â€

He seemed to find that funny.

â€œI dream of things Iâ€™ve not seen all the time, Sassenachâ€”donâ€™t you?â€

â€œWell,â€ I said uncertainly. â€œYes. Sometimes. Monsters, odd plants, I suppose. Peculiar landscapes. And certainly people that I donâ€™t know. But surely thatâ€™s different? To see something you know about, but havenâ€™t seen?â€

â€œWell, what I saw may not be what electric light does look like,â€ he admitted, â€œbut thatâ€™s what I said to myself when I saw it. And I was quite sure that ye were in your own time.

â€œAnd after all,â€ he added logically, â€œI dream of the past; why would I not dream of the future?â€

There was no good answer to a thoroughly Celtic remark of that nature.

â€œWell, you would, I suppose,â€ I said. I rubbed dubiously at my lower lip. â€œHow old was I, in this dream of yours?â€

He looked surprised, then uncertain, and peered closely at my face, as though trying to compare it with some mental vision.

â€œWell . . . I dinna ken,â€ he said, sounding for the first time unsure. â€œI didna think anything about itâ€”I didna notice that ye had white hair, or anything of the sortâ€”it was just . . . you.â€ He shrugged, baffled, then looked down at the stone in my hand.

â€œDoes it feel warm to your touch, Sassenach?â€ he asked curiously.

â€œOf course it does,â€ I said, rather crossly. â€œItâ€™s just come out of hot wax, for heavenâ€™s sake.â€ And yet the emerald did seem to pulse gently in my hand, warm as my own blood and beating like a miniature heart. And when I handed it to him, I felt a small, peculiar reluctanceâ€”as though it did not want to leave me.

â€œGive it to MacDonald,â€ I said, rubbing my palm against the side of my skirt. â€œI hear him outside, talking to Arch; heâ€™ll be wanting to be off.â€



MACDONALD HAD COME pelting up to the Ridge in the midst of a rainstorm the day before, weathered face nearly purple with cold, exertion, and excitement, to inform us that he had found a printing establishment for sale in New Bern.

â€œThe owner has already leftâ€”somewhat involuntarily,â€ he told us, dripping and steaming by the fire. â€œHis friends seek to sell the premises and equipment promptly, before they might be seized or destroyed, and thus provide him with funds to reestablish himself in England.â€

By â€œsomewhat involuntarily,â€ it turned out, he meant that the print shopâ€™s owner was a Loyalist, who had been kidnapped off the street by the local Committee of Safety and shoved willy-nilly onto a ship departing for England. This form of impromptu deportation was becoming popular, and while it was more humane than tar and feathers, it did mean that the printer would arrive penniless in England, and owing money for his passage, to boot.

â€œI happened to meet wiâ€™ some of his friends in a tavern, tearinâ€™ their hair over his sad fate and drinking to his welfareâ€”whereupon I told them that I might be able to put them in the way of an advantage,â€ the Major said, swelling with satisfaction. â€œThey were all ears, when I said that ye mightâ€”just might, mindâ€”have ready cash.â€

â€œWhat makes ye think I do, Donald?â€ Jamie asked, one eyebrow cocked.

MacDonald looked surprised, then knowing. He winked and laid a finger beside his nose.

â€œI hear the odd bit, here and there. Word has it that yeâ€™ve got a wee cache of gemsâ€”or so I hear, from a merchant in Edenton whose bank dealt wiâ€™ one.â€

Jamie and I exchanged looks.

â€œBobby,â€ I said, and he nodded in resignation.

â€œWell, as for me, mumâ€™s the word,â€ MacDonald said, observing this. â€œYe can rely upon my discretion, to be sure. And I doubt the matterâ€™s widely known. But thenâ€”a poor man doesna go about buying muskets by the dozen, now, does he?â€

â€œOh, he might,â€ Jamie said, resigned. â€œYeâ€™d be surprised, Donald. But as it is . . . I imagine a bargain might be struck. What are the printerâ€™s friends askingâ€”and will they offer insurance, in case of fire?â€



MACDONALD HAD BEEN empowered to negotiate on behalf of the printerâ€™s friendsâ€”they being anxious to get the problematical real estate sold before some patriotic soul came and burned it downâ€”and so the bargain was concluded on the spot. MacDonald was sent hurtling back down the mountain to change the emerald into money, conclude payment on the printerâ€™s shop, leaving the residue of the money with Fergus for ongoing expensesâ€”and let it be known as quickly as possible in New Bern that the premises were shortly to be under new management.

â€œAnd if anyone asks about the politics of the new owner . . .â€ Jamie said. To which MacDonald merely nodded wisely, and laid his finger alongside his red-veined nose once more.

I was reasonably sure that Fergus had no personal politics to speak of; beyond his family, his sole allegiance was to Jamie. Once the bargain was made, though, and the frenzy of packing begunâ€”Marsali and Fergus would have to leave at once, to have any chance of making it to New Bern before winter set in in earnestâ€”Jamie had had a serious talk with Fergus.

â€œNow, itâ€™ll no be like it was in Edinburgh. Thereâ€™s no but one other printer in the town, and from what MacDonald says, heâ€™s an elderly gentleman, and sae much afraid oâ€™ the committee and the Governor both, he willna print a thing but books of sermons and handbills advertising horseraces.â€

â€œTrÃ¨s bon,â€ said Fergus, looking even happier, if such a thing was possible. Heâ€™d been going about lit up like a Chinese lantern since hearing the news. â€œWe will have all of the newspaper and broadsheet business, to say nothing of the printing of scandalous plays and pamphletsâ€”there is nothing like sedition and unrest for the printing business, milord, you know that yourself.â€

â€œI do know that,â€ Jamie said very dryly. â€œWhich is why I mean to beat the need for care into your thick skull. I dinna wish to hear that yeâ€™ve been hanged for treason, nor yet tarred-and-feathered for no being treasonous enough.â€

â€œOh, la.â€ Fergus waved an airy hook. â€œI know well enough how this game is played, milord.â€

Jamie nodded, still looking dubious.

â€œAye, ye do. But itâ€™s been some years; ye may be out of practice. And yeâ€™ll not know whoâ€™s who in New Bern; ye dinna want to find yourself buying meat from the man yeâ€™ve savaged in the morningâ€™s paper, aye?â€

â€œIâ€™ll mind that, Da.â€ Marsali sat by the fire, nursing Henri-Christian, and taking close heed. If anything, she looked happier than Fergus, upon whom she looked adoringly. She switched the look of adoration to Jamie, and smiled. â€œWeâ€™ll take good care, I promise.â€

Jamieâ€™s frown softened as he looked at her.

â€œIâ€™ll miss ye, lass,â€ he said softly. Her look of happiness dimmed, but didnâ€™t go out entirely.

â€œIâ€™ll miss ye, too, Da. All of us will. And Germain doesna want to leave Jem, oâ€™ course. But . . .â€ Her eyes drifted back to Fergus, who was making a list of supplies, whistling â€œAlouetteâ€ under his breath, and she hugged Henri-Christian closer, making him kick his legs in protest.

â€œAye, I know.â€ Jamie coughed, to cover his emotion, and wiped a knuckle underneath his nose. â€œNow then, wee Fergus. Yeâ€™ll have a bit of money over; be sure to bribe the constable and the watch first of all. MacDonaldâ€™s given me the names oâ€™ the Royal Council, and the chief Assemblymenâ€”heâ€™ll be of help wiâ€™ the council, as heâ€™s the Governorâ€™s man. Be tactful, aye? But see heâ€™s taken care of; heâ€™s been a great help in the matter.â€

Fergus nodded, head bent over his paper.

â€œPaper, ink, lead, bribes, shammy leather, brushes,â€ he said, writing busily, and resumed absently singing, â€œAlouette, gentil alouette . . .â€



IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO get a wagon up to the Ridge; the only approach was by the narrow trail that wound up the slope from Coopersvilleâ€”one of the factors that had led to the development of that minor crossroads into a small hamlet, as itinerant peddlers and other travelers tended to stop there, making brief forays on foot upward into the mountain.

â€œWhich is all very well for discouraging hostile invasion onto the Ridge,â€ I told Bree, panting as I set down a large canvas-wrapped bundle of candlesticks, chamber pots, and other small household belongings at the side of the trail. â€œBut it unfortunately makes it rather difficult to get off the bloody Ridge, too.â€

â€œI suppose it never occurred to Da that anyone would want to leave,â€ Bree said, grunting as she lowered her own burdenâ€”Marsaliâ€™s cauldron, packed with cheeses, sacks of flour, beans, and rice, plus a wooden box full of dried fish and a string bag of apples. â€œThis thing weighs a ton.â€

She turned and bellowed, â€œGERMAIN!â€ up the trail behind us. Dead silence. Germain and Jemmy were meant to be shepherding Mirabel the goat down to the wagon. They had left the cabin with us, but had been dropping steadily behind.

Neither a call nor a mehhhh came from the trail, but Mrs. Bug came into view, trundling slowly under the weight of Marsaliâ€™s spinning wheel, which she bore on her back, and holding Mirabelâ€™s halter in one hand. Mirabel, a small, neat white goat with gray markings, blatted happily at sight of us.

â€œI found the puir wee lassie tethered to a bush,â€ Mrs. Bug said, setting down the spinning wheel with a wheeze and wiping her face with her apron. â€œNo sign oâ€™ the lads, the wicked wee creatures.â€

Brianna made a low growling noise that boded ill for either Jemmy or Germain, if she caught them. Before she could stomp back up the trail, though, Roger and Young Ian came down, each carrying one end of Marsaliâ€™s loom, collapsed for the occasion into a large bundle of heavy timbers. Seeing the traffic jam in the road, though, they stopped, setting down their burden with sighs of relief.

â€œWhatâ€™s amiss, then?â€ Roger asked, glancing from face to face, and settling on the goat with a frown. â€œWhere are Jem and Germain?â€

â€œDollars to donuts the little fiends are hiding somewhere,â€ Bree said, smoothing tumbled red hair out of her face. Her plait had come undone, and straggling wisps of hair were sticking damply to her face. I was momentarily grateful for my short thicket of curls; no matter what it looked like, it was certainly convenient.

â€œShall I go and look?â€ Ian asked, emerging from the wooden pudding basin heâ€™d been carrying upside down on his head. â€œTheyâ€™ll no have gone far.â€

Sounds of hasty feet from below made everyone turn expectantly in that directionâ€”but it was not the boys, but Marsali, breathless and wide-eyed.

â€œHenri-Christian,â€ she gasped, her eyes flicking rapidly round the group. â€œHave ye got him, Mother Claire? Bree?â€

â€œI thought you had him,â€ Bree said, catching Marsaliâ€™s sense of urgency.

â€œI did. Wee Aidan McCallum was minding him for me, whilst I loaded things into the wagon. But then I stopped to feed himâ€â€”a hand went briefly to her bosomâ€”â€œand they were both vanished! I thought perhaps . . .â€ Her words died away as she began scanning the bushes along the trail, her cheeks flushed with exertion and annoyance.

â€œIâ€™ll strangle him,â€ she said through gritted teeth. â€œAnd whereâ€™s Germain, then?â€ she cried, catching sight of Mirabel, who had taken advantage of the stop to nibble tasty thistles by the path.

â€œThis is beginning to have the look of a plan about it,â€ Roger observed, obviously amused. Ian, too, seemed to be finding something funny in the situation, but vicious glares from the frazzled females present wiped the smirks off their faces.

â€œYes, do go and find them, please,â€ I said, seeing that Marsali was about to either burst into tears or go berserk and throw things.

â€œAye, do,â€ she said tersely. â€œAnd beat them, while yeâ€™re at it.â€



â€œYE KEN WHERE THEY ARE?â€ Ian asked, shading his eyes to look up a trough of tumbled rock.

â€œAye, likely. This way.â€ Roger pushed through a tangle of yaupon and redbud, with Ian after him, and emerged onto the bank of the small creek that paralleled the trail here. Below, he caught a glimpse of Aidanâ€™s favorite fishing place near the ford, but there was no sign of life down there.

Instead, he turned upward, making his way through thick dry grass and loose rocks along the creekbank. Most of the leaves had fallen from the chestnuts and poplars, and lay in slippery mats of brown and gold underfoot.

Aidan had shown him the secret place some time ago; a shallow cave, barely three feet high, hidden at the top of a steep slope overgrown by a thicket of oak saplings. The oaks were bare now, and the caveâ€™s opening easily visible, if you knew to look for it. It was particularly noticeable at the moment, because smoke was coming out of it, slipping veil-like up the face of the rock above, leaving a sharp scent in the cold, dry air.

Ian raised one eyebrow. Roger nodded, and made his way up the slope, making no effort to be quiet about it. There was a mad scuffle of noises inside the cave, thumpings and low cries, and the veil of smoke wavered and stopped, replaced by a loud hiss and a puff of dark gray from the cave mouth as someone threw water on the fire.

Ian, meanwhile, had made his way silently up the side of the rockface above the cave, seeing a small crevice from which a tiny plume of smoke issued. Clinging one-handed to a dogwood that grew out of the rock, he leaned perilously out, and cupping a hand near his mouth, let out a frightful Mohawk scream, directed into the crevice.

Terror-stricken shrieks, much higher-pitched, issued from the cave, followed in short order by a tumble of little boys, pushing and tripping over each other in their haste.

â€œHo, there!â€ Roger snagged his own offspring neatly by the collar as he rushed past. â€œThe jigâ€™s up, mate.â€

Germain, with Henri-Christianâ€™s sturdy form clutched to his midsection, was attempting to escape down the slope, but Ian leapt past him, springing pantherlike down the rocks, and grabbed the baby from him, bringing him to a reluctant stop.

Only Aidan remained at large. Seeing his comrades in captivity, he hesitated at the edge of the slope, obviously wanting to flee, but nobly gave in, coming back with dragging step to share their fate.

â€œRight, lads; sorry, itâ€™s not on.â€ Roger spoke with some sympathy; Jemmy had been upset for days at the prospect of Germainâ€™s leaving.

â€œBut we do not want to go, Uncle Roger,â€ Germain said, employing his most effective look of wide-eyed pleading. â€œWe will stay here; we can live in the cave, and hunt for our food.â€

â€œAye, sir, and me and Jem, weâ€™ll share our dinners wiâ€™ them,â€ Aidan piped up in anxious support.

â€œI brought some of Mamaâ€™s matches, so theyâ€™ve got a fire to keep warm,â€ Jem chipped in eagerly, â€œand a loaf of bread, too!â€

â€œSo ye see, Uncleâ€”â€ Germain spread his hands gracefully in demonstration, â€œwe shall be no trouble to anyone!â€

â€œOh, nay trouble, is it?â€ Ian said, with no less sympathy. â€œTell your mother that, aye?â€

Germain put his hands behind him, clutching his buttocks protectively by reflex.

â€œAnd what were ye thinking, dragging your wee brother up here?â€ Roger said a little more severely. â€œHe can barely walk yet! Two steps out of thereâ€â€”he nodded at the caveâ€”â€œand heâ€™d be tumbling down the burn and his neck broken.â€

â€œOh, no, sir!â€ Germain said, shocked. He fumbled in his pocket and drew out a piece of string. â€œI should tie him up, when I was not there, so he shouldna wander or fall. But I couldna be leaving him; I promised Maman, when he was born, I said I would never leave him.â€

Tears were beginning to trickle down Aidanâ€™s thin cheeks. Henri-Christian, totally confused, began to howl in sympathy, which made Jemâ€™s lower lip tremble, as well. He wriggled out of Rogerâ€™s grasp, ran to Germain, and clutched him passionately about the middle.

â€œGermain canâ€™t go, Daddy, please donâ€™t make him go!â€

Roger rubbed his nose, exchanged brief looks with Ian, and sighed.

He sat down on a rock, and motioned to Ian, who was having a certain amount of difficulty in deciding which way up to hold Henri-Christian. Ian gave him the baby with a noticeable air of relief, and Henri-Christian, feeling the need of security, seized Rogerâ€™s nose with one hand and his hair with the other.

â€œLook, a bhailach,â€ he said, detaching Henri-Christianâ€™s grasp with some difficulty. â€œWee Henri-Christian needs his mother to feed him. Heâ€™s barely got teeth, for Godâ€™s sakeâ€”he canna be living up here in the wild, eating raw meat wiâ€™ you savages.â€

â€œHe has too got teeth!â€ Aidan said stoutly, extending a bitten forefinger in proof. â€œLook!â€

â€œHe eats pap,â€ Germain said, but with some uncertainty to his tone. â€œWe would mash up biscuits for him with milk.â€

â€œHenri-Christian needs his mother,â€ Roger repeated firmly, â€œand your mother needs you. Ye dinna expect her to manage a wagon and two mules and your sisters, all the way to New Bern alone, do ye?â€

â€œBut Papa can help,â€ Germain protested. â€œThe girls mind him, when they mind no one else!â€

â€œYour papaâ€™s gone already,â€ Ian informed him. â€œHeâ€™s ridden ahead, to find a place for ye all to live, once yeâ€™ve got there. Your motherâ€™s to follow on, wiâ€™ all your things. Roger Macâ€™s right, a bhailachâ€”your mother needs ye.â€

Germainâ€™s small face paled a little. He looked helplessly down at Jemmy, still clinging to him, then up the hill at Aidan, and gulped. The wind had come up, and blew his blond fringe back from his face, making him look very small and fragile.

â€œWell, then,â€ he said, and stopped, swallowing. Very gently, he put his arms round Jemmyâ€™s shoulders and kissed the top of his round red head.

â€œIâ€™ll come back, cousin,â€ he said. â€œAnd you will come and visit me by the sea. Youâ€™ll come, too,â€ he assured Aidan, looking up. Aidan sniffed, nodding, and made his way slowly down the slope.

Roger reached out a free hand and gently detached Jemmy. â€œGet on my back, mo chuisle,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s a steep slope; Iâ€™ll take ye down pick-a-back.â€

Not waiting to be asked, Ian leaned down and picked up Aidan, who wrapped his legs round Ianâ€™s middle, hiding his tear-streaked face in Ianâ€™s buckskin shirt.

â€œDâ€™ye want to ride, too?â€ Roger asked Germain, standing up carefully under the weight of his double burden. â€œIan can carry ye, if ye like.â€

Ian nodded and held out a hand, but Germain shook his head, blond hair flying.

â€œNon, Uncle Roger,â€ he said, almost too softly to hear. â€œIâ€™ll walk.â€ And turning round, began to make his way gingerly down the precipitous slope.

A STAMPEDE OF BEAVERS




October 25, 1774

THEY HAD BEEN WALKING for an hour before Brianna began to realize that they werenâ€™t after game. Theyâ€™d cut the trail of a small herd of deer, with droppings so fresh that the pellets were still patchy with moisture, but Ian ignored the sign, pushing up the slope in single-minded determination.

Rollo had come with them, but after several fruitless attempts to draw his masterâ€™s attention to promising scents, abandoned them in disgust and bounded off through the flurrying leaves to do his own hunting.

The climb was too steep to permit conversation, even had Ian seemed inclined. With a mental shrug, she followed, but kept gun in hand and an eye on the brush, just in case.

They had left the Ridge at dawn; it was well past noon when they paused at last, on the bank of some small and nameless stream. A wild grapevine wrapped itself round the trunk of a persimmon that overhung the bank; animals had taken most of the grapes, but a few bunches still hung out over the water, out of reach for any but the most daring of squirrelsâ€”or a tall woman.

She shucked her moccasins and waded into the stream, gasping at the icy shock of the water on her calves. The grapes were ripe to bursting, so purple as to be nearly black, and sticky with juice. The squirrels hadnâ€™t got to them, but the wasps had, and she kept a cautious eye on the dagger-bellied foragers as she twisted the tough stem of a particularly succulent bunch.

â€œSo, do you want to tell me what weâ€™re really looking for?â€ she asked, back turned to her cousin.

â€œNo,â€ he said, a smile in his voice.

â€œOh, a surprise, is it?â€ She popped the stem, and turned to toss the grapes to him.

He caught the bunch one-handed, and set them down on the bank beside the ragged knapsack in which he carried provisions.

â€œSomething oâ€™ the sort.â€

â€œAs long as we arenâ€™t just out for a walk, then.â€ She twisted off another bunch, and sloshed ashore, to sit down beside him.

â€œNo, not that.â€ He flipped two grapes into his mouth, crushed them, and spat the skins and pips with the ease of long custom. She nibbled hers more daintily, biting one in half and flicking the seeds out with a fingernail.

â€œYou ought to eat the skins, Ian; they have vitamins.â€

He raised one shoulder in skepticism, but said nothing. Both she and her mother had explained the concept of vitaminsâ€”numerous timesâ€”to little or no effect. Jamie and Ian had reluctantly been obliged to admit the existence of germs, because Claire could show them teeming seas of microorganisms in her microscope. Vitamins, however, were unfortunately invisible and thus could be safely ignored.

â€œIs it much farther, this surprise?â€ The grape skins were, in fact, very bitter. Her mouth puckered involuntarily as she bit into one. Ian, industriously eating and spitting, noticed and grinned at her.

â€œAye, a bit farther.â€

She cast an eye at the horizon; the sun was coming down the sky. If they were to turn back now, it would be dark before they reached home.

â€œHow much farther?â€ She spit the mangled grape skin into her palm and flicked it away into the grass.

Ian glanced at the sun, too, and pursed his lips.

â€œWell . . . I should think weâ€™ll reach it by midday tomorrow.â€

â€œWeâ€™ll what? Ian!â€ He looked abashed, and ducked his head.

â€œIâ€™m sorry, coz. I ken I should have told ye beforeâ€”but I thought ye maybe wouldnâ€™t come, if I said how far.â€

A wasp lighted on the bunch of grapes in her hand, and she slapped it irritably away.

â€œYou know I wouldnâ€™t. Ian, what were you thinking? Roger will have a fit!â€

Her cousin seemed to find the notion funny; his mouth turned up at the corner.

â€œA fit? Roger Mac? I shouldna think so.â€

â€œWell, all right, he wonâ€™t throw a fitâ€”but heâ€™ll be worried. And Jemmy will miss me!â€

â€œNo, theyâ€™ll be all right,â€ Ian assured her. â€œI told Uncle Jamie weâ€™d be gone three days, and he said heâ€™d bring the wean up to the Big House. With your Mam and Lizzie and Mrs. Bug to fuss him, wee Jem wonâ€™t even notice youâ€™re gone.â€

This was likely true, but did nothing to assuage her annoyance.

â€œYou told Da? And he just said fine, and both of you thought it was perfectly all right toâ€”toâ€”lug me off into the woods for three days, without telling me what was going on? Youâ€”youâ€”â€

â€œHigh-handed, insufferable, beastly Scots,â€ Ian said, in such a perfect imitation of her motherâ€™s English accent that she burst out laughing, despite her annoyance.

â€œYes,â€ she said, wiping spluttered grape juice off her chin. â€œExactly!â€

He was still smiling, but his expression had changed; he wasnâ€™t teasing anymore.

â€œBrianna,â€ he said softly, with that Highland lilt that made of her name something strange and graceful. â€œItâ€™s important, aye?â€

He wasnâ€™t smiling at all now. His eyes were fixed on hers, warm, but serious. His hazel eyes were the only feature of any beauty about Ian Murrayâ€™s face, but they held a gaze of such frank, sweet openness that you felt he had let you look inside his soul, just for an instant. She had had occasion before to wonder whether he was aware of this particular effectâ€”but even if he was, it was difficult to resist.

â€œAll right,â€ she said, and waved away a circling wasp, still cross but resigned. â€œAll right. But you still should have told me. And you wonâ€™t tell me, even now?â€

He shook his head, looking down at the grape he was thumbing loose from its stem.

â€œI canâ€™t,â€ he said simply. He flipped the grape into his mouth and turned to open his bagâ€”which, now that she noticed, bulged suspiciously. â€œDâ€™ye want some bread, coz, or a bit of cheese?â€

â€œNo. Letâ€™s go.â€ She stood up and brushed dead leaves from her breeches. â€œThe sooner we get there, the sooner weâ€™ll be back.â€



THEY STOPPED AN HOUR before sunset, while enough light remained to gather wood. The bulging knapsack had proved to contain two blankets, as well as food and a jug of beerâ€”welcome, after the dayâ€™s walking, which had been mostly uphill.

â€œOh, this is a good batch,â€ she said approvingly, sniffing at the neck of the jug after a long, aromatic, hop-edged swallow. â€œWho made it?â€

â€œLizzie. She caught the knack of it from Frau Ute. Before the . . . er . . . mphm.â€ A delicate Scottish noise encompassed the painful circumstances surrounding the dissolution of Lizzieâ€™s betrothal.

â€œMmm. That was too bad, wasnâ€™t it?â€ She lowered her lashes, watching him covertly to see whether he would say anything further about Lizzie. Lizzie and Ian had seemed fond of each other onceâ€”but first he had gone to the Iroquois, and then she had been engaged to Manfred McGillivray when he returned. Now that both of them were free once more . . .

He dismissed her comment about Lizzie with nothing more than a shrug of agreement, though, concentrating on the tedious process of fire-making. The day had been warm and an hour of daylight remained, but the shadows under the trees were already blue; the night would be chilly.

â€œIâ€™m going to have a look at the stream,â€ she announced, plucking a coiled line and hook from the small pile of effects Ian had unloaded from his bag. â€œIt looked like thereâ€™s a trout pool just below the bend, and the flies will be rising.â€

â€œOh, aye.â€ He nodded, but paid her little attention, patiently scraping the pile of kindling a little higher before striking the next shower of sparks from his flint.

As she made her way around the bend of the little creek, she saw that it wasnâ€™t merely a trout poolâ€”it was a beaver pond. The humped mound of the lodge was reflected in still water, and on the far bank she could see the agitated judderings of a couple of willow saplings, evidently in the process of being consumed.

She moved slowly, a wary eye out. Beavers wouldnâ€™t trouble her, but they would make a dash for the water if they saw her, not only splashing, but smacking the water with their tails in alarm. Sheâ€™d heard it before; it was amazingly loud, sounding like a fusillade of gunshots, and guaranteed to scare every fish within miles into hiding.

Gnawed sticks littered the near bank, the white inner wood chiseled as neatly as any carpenter could do, but none was fresh, and she heard nothing nearby but the sigh of wind in the trees. Beavers were not stealthy; none was close.

With a cautious eye on the far bank, she baited the hook with a small chunk of cheese, whirled it slowly overhead, picked up speed as she let the line out, then let it fly. The hook landed with a small plop! in the middle of the pond, but the noise wasnâ€™t sufficient to alarm the beavers; the willow saplings on the far bank continued to shake and heave under the assault of industrious teeth.

The evening hatch was rising, just as sheâ€™d told Ian. The air was soft, cool on her face, and the surface of the water dimpled and glimmered like gray silk shaken in light. Small clouds of gnats drifted in the still air under the trees, prey for the rising of the carnivorous caddis flies, stone flies, and damselflies breaking free of the surface, new-hatched and ravenous.

It was a pity that she hadnâ€™t a casting rod or tied fliesâ€”but still worth a try. Caddis flies werenâ€™t the only things that rose hungry at twilight, and voracious trout had been known to strike at almost anything that floated in front of themâ€”her father had once taken one with a hook adorned with nothing more than a few knotted strands of his own bright hair.

That was a thought. She smiled to herself, brushing back a wisp of hair that had escaped from its plait, and began to draw the line slowly back toward shore. But there were likely more than trout here, and cheese wasâ€”

A strong tug came on the line, and she jerked in surprise. A snag? The line jerked back, and a thrill from the depths shot up her arm like electricity.

The next half hour passed without conscious thought, in the single-minded pursuit of finny prey. She was wet to mid-thigh, rashed with mosquito bites, and her wrist and shoulder ached, but she had three fat fish gleaming in the grass at her feet, a hunterâ€™s sense of profound satisfactionâ€”and a few more crumbs of cheese left in her pocket.

She was drawing back her arm to throw the hook again, when a sudden chorus of squeaks and hisses shattered the evening calm, and a stampede of beavers broke from cover, trundling down the opposite bank of the pond like a platoon of small, furry tanks. She stared at them open-mouthed, and took a step back in reflex.

Then something big and dark appeared among the trees behind the beavers, and further reflex shot adrenaline through her limbs as she whirled to flee. She would have been into the trees and away in an instant, had she not stepped on one of her fish, which slid under her foot like greased butter and dumped her unceremoniously on her backside. From which position she was ideally placed to see Rollo race from the trees in a long, low streak and launch himself in an arching parabola from the top of the bank. Graceful as a comet, he soared through the air and landed in the pond among the beavers, with a splash like a fallen meteor.



IAN LOOKED UP AT HER, open-mouthed. Slowly, his eyes traveled from her dripping hair, over her sopping, mud-smeared clothes, and down to the fishâ€”one slightly squashedâ€”that dangled from a leather string in her hand.

â€œThe fish put up a good fight, did they?â€ he asked, nodding at the string. The corners of his mouth began to twitch.

â€œYes,â€ she said, and dropped them on the ground in front of him. â€œBut not nearly as good a fight as the beavers.â€

â€œBeavers,â€ he said. He rubbed a knuckle meditatively down the bridge of his long, bony nose. â€œAye, I heard them slapping. Yeâ€™ve been fighting beavers?â€

â€œIâ€™ve been rescuing your wretched dog from beavers,â€ she said, and sneezed. She sank to her knees in front of the new-made fire and closed her eyes in momentary bliss at the touch of heat on her shivering body.

â€œOh, Rolloâ€™s back, then? Rollo! Where are ye, hound?â€ The big dog slunk reluctantly out of the shrubbery, tail barely twitching in response to his masterâ€™s call.

â€œWhatâ€™s this I hear about beavers, then, a madadh?â€ Ian said sternly. In response, Rollo shook himself, though no more than a fine mist of water droplets rose from his coat. He sighed, dropped to his belly, and put his nose morosely on his paws.

â€œMaybe he was only after fish, but the beavers didnâ€™t see it that way. They ran from him on shore, but once he was in the waterâ€”â€ Brianna shook her head, and wrung out the soggy tail of her hunting shirt. â€œI tell you what, Ianâ€”you clean those damn fish.â€

He was already doing so, gutting one with a single neat slice up the belly and a scoop of the thumb. He tossed the entrails toward Rollo, who merely let out another sigh, and seemed to flatten against the dead leaves, ignoring the treat.

â€œHeâ€™s no hurt, is he?â€ Ian asked, frowning at his dog.

She glared at him.

â€œNo, he isnâ€™t. I expect heâ€™s embarrassed. You could ask whether Iâ€™m hurt. Do you have any idea what kind of teeth beavers have?â€

The light was nearly gone, but she could see his lean shoulders shaking.

â€œAye,â€ he said, sounding rather strangled. â€œI have. They, um, didna bite ye, did they? I meanâ€”I should think it would be noticeable, if yeâ€™d been gnawed.â€ A small wheeze of amusement escaped him, and he tried to cover it with a cough.

â€œNo,â€ she said, rather coldly. The fire was going well, but not nearly well enough. The evening breeze had come up, and was reaching through the soaked fabric of shirt and breeches to fondle her backside with ice-cold fingers.

â€œIt wasnâ€™t so much the teeth as the tails,â€ she said, shuffling round on her knees to present her back to the fire. She rubbed a hand gingerly over her right arm, where one of the muscular paddles had struck flat on her forearm, leaving a reddened bruise that stretched from wrist to elbow. For a few moments, sheâ€™d thought the bone was broken.

â€œIt was like being hit with a baseball batâ€”er . . . with a club, I mean,â€ she amended. The beavers hadnâ€™t attacked her directly, of course, but being in the water with a panicked wolf-dog and half a dozen sixty-pound rodents in a state of extreme agitation had been rather like walking through an automated car wash on footâ€”a maelstrom of blinding spray and thrashing objects. A chill struck her and she wrapped both arms around herself, shivering.

â€œHere, coz.â€ Ian stood up and skinned the buckskin shirt off over his head. â€œPut this on.â€

She was much too cold and battered to refuse the offer. Retiring modestly behind a bush, she stripped off the wet things and emerged a moment later, clad in Ianâ€™s buckskin, one of the blankets wrapped around her waist sarong-style.

â€œYou donâ€™t eat enough, Ian,â€ she said, sitting down by the fire again, and eyeing him critically. â€œAll your ribs show.â€

They did. Heâ€™d always been lean to the point of thinness, but in his younger years, his teenage scrawniness had seemed quite normal, merely the result of his bones outstripping the growth of the rest of him.

Now he had reached his full growth and had had a year or two to let his muscles catch up. They hadâ€”she could see every sinew in his arms and shouldersâ€”but the knobs of his spine bulged against the tanned skin of his back, and she could see the shadows of his ribs like rippled sand underwater.

He raised a shoulder, but made no reply, intent on skewering the cleaned fish on peeled willow twigs for broiling.

â€œAnd you donâ€™t sleep very well, either.â€ She narrowed her eyes at him across the fire. Even in this light, the shadows and hollows in his face were obvious, despite the distraction of the Mohawk tattoos that looped across his cheekbones. The shadows had been obvious to everyone for months; her mother had wanted to say something to Ian, but Jamie had told her to let the lad be; he would speak when he was ready.

â€œOh, well enough,â€ he murmured, not looking up.

Whether he was ready now or not, she couldnâ€™t say. But heâ€™d brought her here. If he wasnâ€™t ready, he could bloody well get that way fast.

She hadâ€”of courseâ€”wondered all day about the mysterious goal of their journey, and why she was his necessary companion. For a matter of hunting, Ian would have taken one of the men; good as she was with a gun, several of the men on the Ridge were better, including her father. And any one of them would be better suited than she to something like digging out a bearâ€™s den or packing home meat or hides.

They were in the Cherokee lands at the moment; she knew Ian visited the Indians frequently, and was on good terms with several villages. But if it had been a matter of some formal arrangement to be made, surely he would have asked Jamie to accompany him, or Peter Bewlie, with his Cherokee wife to interpret.

â€œIan,â€ she said, with the tone in her voice that could bring almost any man up short. â€œLook at me.â€

His head jerked up, and he blinked at her.

â€œIan,â€ she said, a little more gently, â€œis this to do with your wife?â€

He stayed frozen for a moment, eyes dark and unfathomable. Rollo, in the shadows behind him, suddenly raised his head and let out a small whine of inquiry. That seemed to rouse Ian; he blinked and looked down.

â€œAye,â€ he said, sounding quite matter-of-fact. â€œIt is.â€

He adjusted the angle of the stick he had driven into the earth by the fire; the pale flesh of the fish curled and sizzled, browning on the green wood.

She waited for him to say more, but he didnâ€™t speakâ€”just broke off the edge of a piece of half-cooked fish and held it out to the dog, clicking his tongue in invitation. Rollo rose and sniffed Ianâ€™s ear in concern, but then deigned to take the fish, and lay down again, licking the hot tidbit delicately before scooping it up with his tongue, gathering enough spirit then to engulf the discarded heads and fish guts as well.

Ian pursed his lips a little, and she could see the thoughts flickering half-formed across his face, before he made up his mind to speak.

â€œI did once think of marrying you, ye ken.â€

He gave her a quick, direct glance, and she felt an odd little jolt of realization. Heâ€™d thought about it, all right. And while she had no doubt that his offer then had been made from the purest of motives . . . he was a young man. She hadnâ€™t until this moment realized that he would of course have contemplated every detail of what that offer entailed.

His eyes held hers in wry acknowledgment of the fact that he had indeed imagined the physical details of sharing her bedâ€”and had not found the prospect in any way objectionable. She resisted the impulse to blush and look away; that would discredit them both.

She was suddenlyâ€”and for the first timeâ€”aware of him as a man, rather than as an endearing young cousin. And aware of the heat of his body that had lingered in the soft buckskin when she pulled it on.

â€œIt wouldnâ€™t have been the worst thing in the world,â€ she said, striving to match his matter-of-fact tone. He laughed, and the stippled lines of his tattoos lost their grimness.

â€œNo,â€ he said. â€œMaybe not the bestâ€”that would be Roger Mac, aye? But Iâ€™m glad to hear I wouldna have been the worst, either. Better than Ronnie Sinclair, dâ€™ye think? Or worse than Forbes the lawyer?â€

â€œHa, bloody ha.â€ She refused to be discomposed by his teasing. â€œYou would have been at least third on the list.â€

â€œThird?â€ That got his attention. â€œWhat? Who was second?â€ He actually seemed miffed at the notion that someone might precede him, and she laughed.

â€œLord John Grey.â€

â€œOh? Oh, well. Aye, I suppose heâ€™d do,â€ Ian admitted grudgingly. â€œThough of course, heâ€”â€ He stopped abruptly, and darted a cautious look in her direction.

She felt an answering stab of caution. Did Ian know about John Greyâ€™s private tastes? She thought he must, from the odd expression on his faceâ€”but if not, it was no place of hers to be revealing Lord Johnâ€™s secrets.

â€œHave you met him?â€ she asked curiously. Ian had gone with her parents to rescue Roger from the Iroquois, before Lord John had appeared at her auntâ€™s plantation, where she had met the nobleman herself.

â€œOh, aye.â€ He was still looking wary, though he had relaxed a little. â€œSome years ago. Him and his . . . son. Stepson, I mean. They came to the Ridge, traveling through to Virginia, and stopped a bit. I gave him the measle.â€ He grinned, quite suddenly. â€œOr at least he had the measle. Auntie Claire nursed him through it. Yeâ€™ve met the man yourself, though?â€

â€œYes, at River Run. Ian, the fish is on fire.â€

It was, and he snatched the stick from the flames with a small Gaelic exclamation, waving scorched fingers to cool them. Extinguished in the grass, the fish proved to be quite edible, if a little crispy round the edges, and a tolerably good supper, with the addition of bread and beer.

â€œDid ye meet Lord Johnâ€™s son, then, at River Run?â€ he asked, resuming their conversation. â€œWillie, his name is. A nice wee lad. He fell into the privy,â€ he added thoughtfully.

â€œFell in the privy?â€ she said, laughing. â€œHe sounds like an idiot. Or was he just quite small?â€

â€œNo, a decent size for his age. And sensible enough, for an Englishman. See, it wasna quite his fault, ken. We were looking at a snake, and it came up the branch toward us, and . . . well, it was an accident,â€ he concluded, handing Rollo another piece of fish. â€œYeâ€™ve not seen the lad yourself, though?â€

â€œNo, and I think you are deliberately changing the subject.â€

â€œAye, I am. Dâ€™ye want a bit more beer?â€

She raised an eyebrow at himâ€”he neednâ€™t think he was going to escape that easilyâ€”but nodded, accepting the jug.

They were quiet for a bit, drinking beer and watching the last of the light fade into darkness as the stars came out. The scent of the pine trees strengthened, their sap warmed from the day, and in the distance she heard the occasional gunshot warning slap of a beaverâ€™s tail on the pondâ€”evidently the beavers had posted sentries, in case she or Rollo should sneak back after dark, she thought wryly.

Ian had wrapped his own blanket round his shoulders against the growing chill, and was lying flat in the grass, staring upward into the vault of heaven overhead.

She didnâ€™t make any pretense of not watching him, and was quite sure he was aware of it. His face was quiet for the moment, minus its usual animationâ€”but not guarded. He was thinking, and she was content to let him take his time; it was autumn now and night would be long enough for many things.

She wished she had thought to ask her mother more about the girl Ian called Emilyâ€”the Mohawk name was something multisyllabic and unpronounceable. Small, her mother had said. Pretty, in a neat, small-boned sort of way, and very clever.

Was she dead, Emily the small and clever? She thought not. Sheâ€™d been in this time long enough to have seen many men deal with the death of wives. They showed loss and griefâ€”but they didnâ€™t do what Ian had been doing.

Could he be taking her to meet Emily? That was a staggering thought, but one she rejected almost immediately. It would be a monthâ€™s journey, at least, to reach the Mohawksâ€™ territoryâ€”probably more. But then . . .

â€œI wondered, ken?â€ he said suddenly, still looking up at the sky. â€œDâ€™ye feel sometimes . . . wrong?â€ He glanced at her helplessly, not sure whether heâ€™d said what he meantâ€”but she understood him perfectly.

â€œYes, all the time.â€ She felt a sense of instant, unexpected relief at the admission. He saw the slump of her shoulders, and smiled a little, crookedly.

â€œWell . . . maybe not all the time,â€ she amended. â€œWhen Iâ€™m out in the woods, alone, itâ€™s fine. Or with Roger, by ourselves. Though even then . . .â€ She saw Ianâ€™s eyebrow lift, and hurried to explain. â€œNot that. Not being with him. Itâ€™s just that we . . . we talk about what was.â€

He gave her a look in which sympathy was mingled with interest. Plainly, he would like to know about â€œwhat was,â€ but put that aside for the moment.

â€œThe woods, aye?â€ he said. â€œI see that. When Iâ€™m awake, at least. Sleeping, though . . .â€ He turned his face back toward the empty sky and the brightening stars.

â€œAre you afraidâ€”when the dark comes on?â€ Sheâ€™d felt that now and then; a moment of deep fear at twilightâ€”a sense of abandonment and elemental loneliness as night rose from the earth. A feeling that sometimes remained, even when she had gone inside the cabin, the bolted door secure behind her.

â€œNo,â€ he said, frowning a little at her. â€œYou are?â€

â€œJust a little,â€ she said, waving it away. â€œNot all the time. Not now. But what is it about sleeping in the woods?â€

He sat up, and rocked back a little, big hands linked around one knee, thinking.

â€œAye, well . . .â€ he said slowly. â€œSometimes I think of the auld talesâ€” from Scotland, aye? And ones Iâ€™ve heard now and then, living wiâ€™ the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka. About . . . things that may come upon a man while he sleeps. To lure away his soul.â€

â€œThings?â€ Despite the beauty of the stars and the peace of the evening, she felt something small and cold slide down her back. â€œWhat things?â€

He took a deep breath and blew it out, brows puckered.

â€œYe call them sidhe in the Gaelic. The Cherokee call them the Nunnahee. And the Mohawk have names for them, tooâ€”more than one. But when I heard Eats Turtles tell of them, I kent at once what they were. Itâ€™s the sameâ€”the Old Folk.â€

â€œFairies?â€ she said, and her incredulity must have been clear in her voice, for he glanced up sharply at her, a glint of irritation in his eyes.

â€œNo, I ken what you mean by thatâ€”Roger Mac showed me the wee picture ye drew for Jem, all tiny things like dragonflies, prinking in the flowers. . . .â€ He made an uncouth noise in the back of his throat. â€œNay. These things are . . .â€ He made a helpless gesture with one big hand, frowning at the grass.

â€œVitamins,â€ he said suddenly, looking up.

â€œVitamins,â€ she said, and rubbed a hand between her brows. It had been a long day; they had likely walked fifteen or twenty miles and fatigue had settled like water in her legs and back. The bruises from her battle with the beavers were beginning to throb.

â€œI see. Ian . . . are you sure that your head isnâ€™t still a bit cracked?â€ She said it lightly, but her real anxiety lest it be true must have shown in her voice, for he gave a low, rueful chuckle.

â€œNo. Or at leastâ€”I dinna think so. I was onlyâ€”well, dâ€™ye see, itâ€™s like that. Ye canna see the vitamins, but you and Auntie Claire ken weel that theyâ€™re there, and Uncle Jamie and I must take it on faith that yeâ€™re right about it. I ken as much about theâ€”the Old Ones. Can ye no believe me about that?â€

â€œWell, Iâ€”â€ She had begun to agree, for the sake of peace between themâ€”but a feeling swept over her, sudden and cold as a cloud-shadow, that she wished to say nothing to acknowledge the notion. Not out loud. And not here.

â€œOh,â€ he said, catching sight of her face. â€œSo ye do know.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know, no,â€ she said. â€œBut I donâ€™t know itâ€™s not, either. And I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good idea to talk about things like that, in a wood at night, a million miles away from civilization. All right?â€

He smiled a little at that, and nodded in acceptance.

â€œAye. And itâ€™s no what I meant to say, really. Itâ€™s more . . .â€ His feathery brows knitted in concentration. â€œWhen I was a bairn, Iâ€™d wake in my bed, and Iâ€™d ken at once where I was, aye? There was the windowâ€â€”he flung out a handâ€”â€œand there was the basin and ewer on the table, wiâ€™ a blue band round the top, and thereâ€â€”he pointed toward a laurel bushâ€”â€œwas the big bed where Janet and Michael were sleepinâ€™, and Jocky the dog at the bed fit, farting like a beetle, and the smell of peat smoke from the fire and . . . well, even if I should wake at midnight and the house all still around me, I should ken at once where I was.â€

She nodded, the memory of her own old room in the house on Furey Street rising around her, vivid as a vision in the smoke. The striped wool blanket, itchy under her chin, and the mattress with the indentation of her body in the middle, cupping her like a huge, warm hand. Angus, the stuffed Scottie with the ragged tam-o-shanter who shared her bed, and the comforting hum of her parentsâ€™ conversation from the living room below, punctuated by the baritone sax of the theme music from Perry Mason.

Most of all, the sense of absolute security.

She had to close her eyes, and swallow twice before answering.

â€œYes. I know what you mean.â€

â€œAye. Well. For some time after I left home, I might find myself sleeping rough, wiâ€™ Uncle Jamie in the heather, or here and there in inns and pothouses. Iâ€™d wake wiâ€™ no notion where I wasâ€”and still, Iâ€™d ken I was in Scotland. It was all right.â€ He paused, lower lip caught between his teeth as he struggled to find the right words.

â€œThen . . . things happened. I wasna in Scotland any longer, and home was . . . gone.â€ His voice was soft, but she could hear the echo of loss in it.

â€œI would wake, with no idea where I might beâ€”or who.â€

He was hunched over now, big hands hanging loose between his thighs as he gazed into the fire.

â€œBut when I lay wiâ€™ Emilyâ€”from the first time. I knew. Kent who I was again.â€ He looked up at her then, eyes dark and shadowed by loss. â€œMy soul didna wander while I sleptâ€”when I slept wiâ€™ her.â€

â€œAnd now it does?â€ she asked quietly, after a moment.

He nodded, wordless. The wind whispered in the trees above. She tried to ignore it, obscurely afraid that if she listened closely, she might hear words.

â€œIan,â€ she said, and touched his arm, very lightly. â€œIs Emily dead?â€

He sat quite still for a minute, then took a deep, shuddering breath, and shook his head.

â€œI dinna think so.â€ He sounded very doubtful, though, and she could see the trouble in his face.

â€œIan,â€ she said very softly. â€œCome here.â€

He didnâ€™t move, but when she scooted close and put her arms around him, he didnâ€™t resist. She pulled him down with her, insisting that he lie beside her, his head pillowed in the curve between shoulder and breast, her arm around him.

Mother instinct, she thought, wryly amused. Whateverâ€™s wrong, the first thing you do is pick them up and cuddle them. And if theyâ€™re too big to lift . . . and if his warm weight and the sound of his breathing in her ear kept the voices in the wind at bay, so much the better.

She had a fragmentary memory, a brief vivid image of her mother standing behind her father in the kitchen of their house in Boston. He lay back in a straight chair, his head against her motherâ€™s stomach, eyes closed in pain or exhaustion, as she rubbed his temples. What had it been? A headache? But her motherâ€™s face had been gentle, the lines of her own dayâ€™s stress smoothed away by what she was doing.

â€œI feel a fool,â€ Ian said, sounding shyâ€”but didnâ€™t pull away.

â€œNo, you donâ€™t.â€

He took a deep breath, squirmed a little, and settled cautiously into the grass, his body barely touching hers.

â€œAye, well. I suppose not, then,â€ he murmured. He relaxed by wary degrees, his head growing heavier on her shoulder, the muscles of his back yielding slowly, their tension subsiding under her hand. Very tentatively, as though expecting her to slap him away, he lifted one arm and laid it over her.

It seemed the wind had died. The firelight shone on his face, the dark dotted lines of his tattoos standing out against the young skin. His hair smelled of woodsmoke and dust, soft against her cheek.

â€œTell me,â€ she said.

He sighed, deeply.

â€œNot yet,â€ he said. â€œWhen we get there, aye?â€

He would not say more, and they lay together, quiet in the grass, and safe.

Brianna felt sleep come, the waves of it gentle, lifting her toward peace, and did not resist. The last thing she recalled was Ianâ€™s face, cheek heavy on her shoulder, his eyes still open, watching the fire.



WALKING ELK WAS telling a story. It was one of his best stories, but Ian wasnâ€™t paying proper attention. He sat across the fire from Walking Elk, but it was the flames he was watching, not his friendâ€™s face.

Very odd, he thought. Heâ€™d been watching fires all his life, and never seen the woman in them, until these winter months. Of course, peat fires had no great flame to speak of, though they had a good heat and a lovely smell . . . oh. Aye, so she was there, after all, the woman. He nodded slightly, smiling. Walking Elk took this as an expression of approval at his performance and became even more dramatic in his gestures, scowling horrendously and lurching to and fro with bared teeth, growling in illustration of the glutton he had carefully tracked to its lair.

The noise distracted Ian from the fire, drawing his attention to the story again. Just in time, for Walking Elk had reached the climax, and the young men nudged each other in anticipation. Walking Elk was short and heavily builtâ€”not so much unlike a glutton himself, which made his imitations that much more entertaining.

He turned his head, wrinkling up his nose and growling through his teeth, as the glutton caught the hunterâ€™s scent. Then he changed in a flash, became the hunter, creeping carefully through the brush, pausing, squatting lowâ€”and springing upward with a sharp yelp, as his buttock encountered a thorny plant.

The men around the fire whooped as Walking Elk became the glutton, who looked at first astonished at the noise, and then thrilled to have seen its prey. It leaped from its lair, uttering growls and sharp yips of rage. The hunter fell back, horrified, and turned to run. Walking Elkâ€™s stubby legs churned the pounded earth of the longhouse, running in place. Then he threw up his arms and sprawled forward with a despairing â€œAy-YIIIIII!â€ as the glutton struck him in the back.

The men shouted encouragement, slapping their palms on their thighs, as the beleaguered hunter managed to roll onto his back, thrashing and cursing, grappling with the glutton that sought to tear out his throat.

The firelight gleamed on the scars that decorated Walking Elkâ€™s chest and shouldersâ€”thick white gouges that showed briefly at the gaping neck of his shirt as he writhed picturesquely, arms straining upward against his invisible enemy. Ian found himself leaning forward, his breath short and his own shoulders knotted with effort, though he knew what was coming next.

Walking Elk had done it many times, but it never failed. Ian had tried it himself, but couldnâ€™t do it at all. The hunter dug his heels and shoulders into the dirt, his body arched like a bow at full stretch. His legs trembled, his arms shookâ€”surely they would give way at any moment. The men by the fire held their breath.

Then it came: a soft, sudden click. Distinct and somehow muffled, it was exactly the sound made by the breaking of a neck. The snap of bone and ligament, muffled in flesh and fur. The hunter stayed arched a moment, unbelieving, and then slowly, slowly, lowered himself to the ground and sat up, staring at the body of his enemy, clutched limp in his hands.

He cast up his eyes in prayerful thanks, then stopped, wrinkling his nose. He glanced down, face screwed into a grimace, and rubbed fastidiously at his leggings, soiled by the odorous voidings of the glutton. The hearth rocked with laughter.

A small bucket of spruce beer was making the rounds; Walking Elk beamed, his face shining with sweat, and accepted it. His short, thick throat worked industriously, sucking the sharp drink down as though it was water. He lowered the bucket at last and looked about in dreamy satisfaction.

â€œYou, Wolfâ€™s Brother. Tell us a story!â€ He threw the half-empty bucket across the fire; Ian caught it, only sloshing a little over his wrist. He sucked the liquid from his sleeve, laughed, and shook his head. He took a quick mouthful of beer and passed the bucket to Sleeps with Snakes, beside him.

Eats Turtles, on his other side, poked Ian in the ribs, wanting him to talk, but he shook his head again and shrugged, jerking his chin toward Snake.

Snake, nothing loath, set the bucket neatly before him and leaned forward, the firelight dancing on his face as he began to talk. He was no actor like Walking Elk, but he was an older manâ€”perhaps thirtyâ€”and had traveled much in his youth. He had lived with the Assiniboin and the Cayuga, and had many stories from them, which he told with great skillâ€”if less sweat.

â€œWill you talk later, then?â€ Turtle said in Ianâ€™s ear. â€œI want to hear more tales of the great sea and the woman with green eyes.â€

Ian nodded, a little reluctant. He had been very drunk the first time, or he would never have spoken of Geillis Abernathy. It was only that they had been drinking traderâ€™s rum, and the spinning sensation it caused in his head was very like that caused by the stuff sheâ€™d given him to drink, though the taste was different. That caused a giddiness that made his eyes blur, so candle flames streaked and ran like water, and the flames of the fire seemed to overflow and leap the hearthstones, glimmering all round her lavish room, small separate blazes springing up in all the rounded surfaces of silver and glass, gems and polished woodâ€”flickering brightest behind green eyes.

He glanced around. There were no shining surfaces here. Clay pots, rough firewood, and the smooth poles of bed frames, grinding stones and woven baskets; even the cloth and furs of their clothes were soft dull colors that drowned the light. It must have been only the memory of those times of light-glazed dizziness that had brought her to mind.

He seldom thought of the Mistressâ€”that was how the slaves and the other boys spoke of her; she needed no more name than that, for no one could imagine another of her sort. He did not value his memories of her, but Uncle Jamie had told him not to hide from them, and he obeyed, finding it good counsel.

He stared intently into the fire, only half-hearing Snakeâ€™s recounting of the story about Goose and how he had outwitted the Evil One to bring tobacco to the People and save Old Manâ€™s life. Was it her, then, the witch Geillis, that he saw in the fire?

He thought it was not. The woman in the fire gave him a warm feeling when he saw her that ran from his heated face down through his chest and curled up low and hot in his belly. The woman in the fire had no face; he saw her limbs, her curving back, a sweep of long, smooth hair, twisting toward him, gone in a flicker; he heard her laugh, soft and breathy, far awayâ€”and it was not Geillis Abernathyâ€™s laugh.

Still, Turtleâ€™s words had brought her to his mind, and he could see her there. He sighed to himself and thought what story he might tell, when it came his turn. Perhaps he would tell about Mrs. Abernathyâ€™s twin slaves, the huge black men who did her every bidding; he had once seen them kill a crocodile, and carry it up from the river between them to lay it at her feet.

He didnâ€™t mind so much. He had foundâ€”after that first drunken tellingâ€”that to speak of her in such a way caused him to think of her in the same wayâ€”as though she was a story, interesting but unreal. Perhaps she had happened, as perhaps Goose had brought tobacco to Old Manâ€”but it did not seem so much as though she had happened to him.

And after all, he had no scars, like Walking Elkâ€™s, that would remind either his hearers or himself that he spoke truth.

In truth, he was growing bored with drinking and stories. The real truth was that he longed to escape to the furs and cool darkness of his bed platform, shed his clothes, and curl his hot nakedness around his wife. Her name meant â€œWorks with Her Hands,â€ but in the privacy of bed, he called her Emily.

Their time was growing short; in two moons more, she would leave, to go to the womenâ€™s house, and he would not see her. Another moon before the child came, one more after that for cleansing . . . The thought of two months spent cold and alone, without her next to him at night, was enough to make him reach for the beer as it came around, and drink deep.

Only the bucket was empty. His friends giggled as he held it upside down above his open mouth, a single amber drop splattering on his surprised nose.

A small hand reached over his shoulder and took the bucket from his grasp, as its partner reached over his other shoulder, holding a full one.

He took the bucket and twisted, smiling up at her. Works with Her Hands smiled smugly back; it gave her great pleasure to anticipate his wants. She knelt behind him, the curve of her belly pressing warm against his back, and swatted away Turtleâ€™s hand as he reached for the beer.

â€œNo, let my husband have it! He tells much better stories when heâ€™s drunk.â€

Turtle closed one eye, fixing her with the other. He was swaying slightly.

â€œIs it that he tells better stories when heâ€™s drunk?â€ he asked. â€œOr do we just think theyâ€™re better, because weâ€™re drunk?â€

Works with Her Hands ignored this philosophical inquiry and proceeded to make room for herself at the hearth, swinging her solid little bum deftly back and forth like a battering ram. She settled comfortably next to Ian, folding her arms atop her mound.

Other young women had come in with her, bringing more beer. They nudged their way in among the young men, murmuring, poking, and laughing. Heâ€™d been wrong, Ian thought, watching them. The firelight shone on their faces, glanced from their teeth, caught the moist shine of eyes and the soft dark flesh inside their mouths as they laughed. The fire gleamed on their faces more than it had ever shone from the crystal and silver of Rose Hall.

â€œSo, husband,â€ Emily said, lowering her eyelids demurely. â€œTell us about this woman with green eyes.â€

He took a thoughtful swallow of beer, then another.

â€œOh,â€ he said. â€œShe was a witch, and a very wicked womanâ€”but she did make good beer.â€

Emilyâ€™s eyes flew open wide, and everyone laughed. He looked into her eyes and saw it, clearly; the image of the fire behind him, tiny and perfectâ€”welcoming him in.

â€œBut not as good as yours,â€ he said. He lifted the bucket in salute, and drank deep.

EMILY




BRIANNA WOKE IN THE MORNING stiff and sore, but with one clear thought in mind. Okay. I know who I am. She had no clear idea where she was, but that didnâ€™t matter. She lay still for a moment, feeling oddly peaceful, despite the urge to get up and pee.

How long had it been, she wondered, since she had wakened alone and peaceful, with no company but her own thoughts? Really, not since she had stepped through the stones, she thought, in search of her family. And found them.

â€œIn spades,â€ she murmured, stretching gingerly. She groaned, staggered to her feet, and shuffled into the brush to pee and change back into her own clothes before returning to the blackened fire ring.

She unplaited her draggled hair, and began groggily combing her fingers through it. There was no sign of Ian or the dog nearby, but she wasnâ€™t concerned. The wood around her was filled with the racket of birds, but not alarm calls, just the daily business of flutter and feeding, a cheerful chatter that didnâ€™t alter when she rose. The birds had been watching her for hours; they werenâ€™t concerned, either.

She never woke easily, but the simple pleasure of not being dragged from sleep by the insistent demands of those who did made the morning air seem particularly sweet, in spite of the bitter tang of ashes from the dead fire.

Mostly awake, she wiped a handful of dew-wet poplar leaves over her face by way of a morning toilette, then squatted by the fire ring and began the chore of fire-starting. They had no coffee to boil, but Ian would be hunting. With luck, thereâ€™d be something to cook; theyâ€™d eaten everything in the knapsack, save a heel of bread.

â€œHeck with this,â€ she muttered, whacking flint and steel together for the dozenth time, and seeing the spatter of sparks wink out without catching. If Ian had only told her they were camping, she would have brought her fire-striker, or some matchesâ€”though on second thought, she was not sure that would be safe. The things could easily burst into flame in her pocket.

â€œHow did the Greeks do it?â€ she said aloud, scowling at the tiny mat of charred cloth on which she was attempting to catch a spark. â€œThey must have had a way.â€

â€œThe Greeks had what?â€

Ian and Rollo were back, having captured, respectively, half a dozen yams and a blue-gray waterbird of some kindâ€”a small heron? Rollo refused to allow her to look at it, and took his prey off to devour under a bush, its long, limp yellow legs dragging on the ground.

â€œThe Greeks had what?â€ Ian repeated, turning out a pocket full of chestnuts, red-brown skins gleaming from the remnants of their prickly hulls.

â€œHad stuff called phosphorus. You ever heard of it?â€

Ian looked blank, and shook his head.

â€œNo. What is it?â€

â€œStuff,â€ she said, finding no better word to hand. â€œLord John sent me some, so I could make matches.â€

â€œMatches between whom?â€ Ian inquired, regarding her warily.

She stared at him for a moment, her morning-sodden mind making slow sense of the conversation.

â€œOh,â€ she said, having at last discovered the difficulty. â€œNot that kind of match. Those fire-starters I made. Phosphorus burns by itself. Iâ€™ll show you, when we get home.â€ She yawned, and gestured vaguely at the small pile of unlit kindling in the fire ring.

Ian made a tolerant Scottish noise and took up the flint and steel himself.

â€œIâ€™ll do it. Do the nuts, aye?â€

â€œOkay. Here, you should put your shirt back on.â€ Her own clothes had dried, and while she missed the comfort of Ianâ€™s buckskin, the worn thick wool of her fringed hunting shirt was warm and soft on her skin. It was a bright day, but chilly so early in the morning. Ian had discarded his blanket while starting the fire, and his bare shoulders were pebbled with gooseflesh.

He shook his head slightly, though, indicating that heâ€™d put on his shirt in a bit. For now . . . his tongue stuck out of the corner of his mouth in concentration as he struck flint and steel again, then disappeared as he muttered something under his breath.

â€œWhat did you say?â€ She paused, a half-hulled nut in her fingers.

â€œOh, itâ€™s no but aâ€”â€ Heâ€™d struck once more and caught a spark, glowing like a tiny star on the square of char. Hastily, he touched a wisp of dry grass to it, then another, and as a tendril of smoke rose up, added a bark chip, more grass, a handful of chips, and finally a careful crisscross of pine twigs.

â€œNo but a fire charm,â€ he finished, grinning at her over the infant blaze that had sprung up before him.

She applauded briefly, then proceeded to cut the skin of the chestnut she was holding, crosswise, so it wouldnâ€™t burst in the fire.

â€œI havenâ€™t heard that one,â€ she said. â€œTell me the words.â€

â€œOh.â€ He didnâ€™t blush easily, but the skin of his throat darkened a little. â€œItâ€™s . . . itâ€™s no the Gaelic, that one. Itâ€™s the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka.â€

Her brows went up, as much at the easy sound of the word on his tongue as at what heâ€™d said.

â€œDo you ever think in Mohawk, Ian?â€ she asked curiously.

He shot her a glance of surprise, almost, she thought, of fright.

â€œNo,â€ he said tersely, and rose off his heels. â€œIâ€™ll fetch a bit of wood.â€

â€œI have some,â€ she said, holding him with a stare. She reached behind her and thrust a fallen pine bough into the kindling fire. The dry needles burst in a puff of sparks and were gone, but the ragged bark began to catch and burn at the edges.

â€œWhat is it?â€ she said. â€œWhat I said, about thinking in Mohawk?â€

His lips pressed tight together, not wanting to answer.

â€œYou asked me to come,â€ she said, not sharp with him, but firm.

â€œSo I did.â€ He took a deep breath, then looked down at the yams he was burying in the heating ashes to bake.

She worked on the nuts slowly, watching him make up his mind. Loud chewing sounds and intermittent puffs of blue-gray feathers drifted out from under Rolloâ€™s bush, behind him.

â€œDid ye dream last night, Brianna?â€ he asked suddenly, his eyes still on what he was doing.

She wished he had brought something coffeelike to boil, but still, she was sufficiently awake by now as to be able to think and respond coherently.

â€œYes,â€ she said. â€œI dream a lot.â€

â€œAye, I ken that. Roger Mac told me ye write them down sometimes.â€

â€œHe did?â€ That was a jolt, and one bigger than a cup of coffee. Sheâ€™d never hidden her dreambook from Roger, but they didnâ€™t really discuss it, either. How much of it had he read?

â€œHe didna tell me anything about them,â€ Ian assured her, catching the tone of her voice. â€œOnly that ye wrote things down, sometimes. So I thought, maybe, those would be important.â€

â€œOnly to me,â€ she said, but cautiously. â€œWhy . . . ?â€

â€œWell, dâ€™ye seeâ€”the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka set great store by dreams. More even than Highlanders.â€ He glanced up with a brief smile, then back at the ashes where he had buried the yams. â€œWhat did ye dream of last night, then?â€

â€œBirds,â€ she said, trying to recall. â€œLots of birds.â€ Reasonable enough, she thought. The forest around her had been live with birdsong since well before dawn; of course it would seep into her dreams.

â€œAye?â€ Ian seemed interested. â€œWere the birds alive, then?â€

â€œYes,â€ she said, puzzled. â€œWhy?â€

He nodded, and picked up a chestnut to help her.

â€œThatâ€™s good, to dream of live birds, especially if they sing. Dead birds are a bad thing, in a dream.â€

â€œThey were definitely alive, and singing,â€ she assured him, with a glance up at the branch above him, where some bird with a bright yellow breast and black wings had lighted, viewing their breakfast preparations with interest.

â€œDid any of them talk to ye?â€

She stared at him, but he was clearly serious. And after all, she thought, why wouldnâ€™t a bird talk to you, in a dream?

She shook her head, though.

â€œNo. They wereâ€”oh.â€ She laughed, unexpectedly recalling. â€œThey were building a nest out of toilet paper. I dream about toilet paper all the time. Thatâ€™s a thin, soft kind of paper that you use to wipe your, er, behind with,â€ she explained, seeing his incomprehension.

â€œYe wipe your arse with paper?â€ He stared at her, jaw dropped in horror. â€œJesus God, Brianna!â€

â€œWell.â€ She rubbed a hand under her nose, trying not to laugh at his expression. He might well be horrified; there were no paper mills in the Colonies, and aside from tiny amounts of handmade paper such as she made herself, every sheet had to be imported from England. Paper was hoarded and treasured; her father, who wrote frequently to his sister in Scotland, would write a letter in the normal fashionâ€”but then would turn the paper sideways, and write additional lines perpendicularly, to save space. Little wonder that Ian was shocked!

â€œItâ€™s very cheap then,â€ she assured him. â€œReally.â€

â€œNot as cheap as a cob oâ€™ maize, Iâ€™ll warrant,â€ he said, narrow-eyed with suspicion.

â€œBelieve it or not, most people then wonâ€™t have cornfields to hand,â€ she said, still amused. â€œAnd I tell you what, Ianâ€”toilet paper is much nicer than a dry corncob.â€

â€œâ€˜Nicer,â€™â€ he muttered, obviously still shaken to the core. â€œNicer. Jesus, Mary, and Bride!â€

â€œYou were asking me about dreams,â€ she reminded him. â€œDid you dream last night?â€

â€œOh. Ah . . . no.â€ He turned his attention from the scandalous notion of toilet paper with some difficulty. â€œOr at least if I did, I dinna recall it.â€

It came to her suddenly, looking at his hollowed face, that one reason for his sleeplessness might be that he was afraid of what dreams might come to him.

In fact, he seemed afraid now that she might press him on the subject. Not meeting her eye, he picked up the empty beer jug and clicked his tongue for Rollo, who followed him, blue-gray feathers sticking to his jaws.

She had cut the last of the chestnut skins and buried the gleaming marrons in the ashes to bake with the yams, by the time he came back.

â€œJust in time,â€ she called, seeing him. â€œThe yams are ready.â€

â€œJust in time, forbye,â€ he answered, smiling. â€œSee what Iâ€™ve got?â€

What he had was a chunk of honeycomb, thieved from a bee tree and still chilled enough that the honey ran slow and thick, drizzled over the hot yams in glorious blobs of gold sweetness. Garnished with roasted, peeled, sweet chestnuts and washed down with cold creek water, she thought it was possibly the best breakfast sheâ€™d eaten since leaving her own time.

She said as much, and Ian lifted one feathery brow in derision.

â€œOh, aye? And what would ye eat then thatâ€™s better?â€

â€œOooh . . . chocolate donuts, maybe. Or hot chocolate, with marshmallows in it. I really miss chocolate.â€ Though it was hard to miss it much at the moment, licking honey off her fingers.

â€œOch, get on wiâ€™ ye! Iâ€™ve had chocolate.â€ He squinched his eyes and pinched his lips in exaggerated distaste. â€œBitter, nasty stuff. Though they did charge a terrible lot of money just for a wee cup of it, in Edinburgh,â€ he added practically, unsquinching.

She laughed.

â€œThey put sugar in it, where I come from,â€ she assured him. â€œItâ€™s sweet.â€

â€œSugar in your chocolate? Thatâ€™s the most decadent thing Iâ€™ve ever heard of,â€ he said severely. â€œEven worse than the arse-wiping paper, aye?â€ She saw the teasing glint in his eye, though, and merely snorted, nibbling the last shreds of orange yam flesh from the blackened skin.

â€œSomeday Iâ€™ll get hold of some chocolate, Ian,â€ she said, discarding the limp peel and licking her fingers like a cat. â€œIâ€™ll put sugar in it and feed it to you, and see what you think then!â€

It was his turn to snort, good-naturedly, but he made no further remarks, concentrating instead on licking his own hands clean.

Rollo had appropriated the remnants of honeycomb, and was noisily gnawing and slurping at the wax, with complete enjoyment.

â€œThat dog must have the digestion of a crocodile,â€ Brianna said, shaking her head. â€œIs there anything he wonâ€™t eat?â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™ve no tried him on nails, yet.â€ Ian smiled briefly, but didnâ€™t take up the conversation. The unease that had lain upon him when he talked of dreams had disappeared over breakfast, but seemed now to have returned. The sun was well up, but he made no move to rise. He merely sat, arms wrapped about his knees, gazing thoughtfully into the fire as the rising sun stole the light from the flames.

In no great hurry to start moving herself, Brianna waited patiently, eyes fixed on him.

â€œAnd what would you eat for breakfast when you lived with the Mohawk, Ian?â€

He looked at her then, and his mouth tucked in at one corner. Not a smile, but a wry acknowledgment. He sighed, and laid his head on his knees, face hidden. He sat slumped that way for a bit, then slowly straightened up.

â€œWell,â€ he said, in a matter-of-fact tone of voice. â€œIt was to do wiâ€™ my brother-in-law. At least to start.â€



IAN MURRAY THOUGHT that before too long, he would be obliged to do something about his brother-in-law. Not that â€œbrother-in-lawâ€ was precisely the word for it. Still, Sun Elk was the husband of Looking at the Sky, who was in turn the sister of his own wife. By the notions of the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka this implied no relation between the men beyond that of clansmen, but Ian still thought of Sun Elk with the white part of his mind.

That was the secret part. His wife had English, but they did not speak it, even when most private. He spoke no word of Scots or English aloud, had heard not a syllable of either tongue in the year since he had chosen to stay, to become Kahnyenâ€™kehaka. It was assumed he had forgotten what he had been. But each day he found some moment to himself, and, lest he lose the words, would silently name the objects around him, hearing their English names echo in the hidden white part of his mind.

Pot, he thought to himself, squinting at the blackened earthenware warming in the ashes. In fact he was not alone at the moment. He was, however, feeling distinctly alien.

Corn, he thought, leaning back against the polished tree trunk that formed one upright of the longhouse. Several clusters of dried maize hung above him, festively colored by comparison with the sacks of grain sold in Edinburghâ€”and yet corn nonetheless. Onions, he thought, eyes passing down the braided chain of yellow globes. Bed. Furs. Fire.

His wife leaned toward him, smiling, and the words ran suddenly together in his mind. BlackravenblackhairshiningbreastbudsthighssoroundohyesohyesohEmily . . .

She set a warm bowl in his hand, and the rich aroma of rabbit and corn and onion rose up into his nose. Stew, he thought, the slippery flow of words coming to a sudden halt as his mind focused on food. He smiled at her, and laid his hand over hers, holding it for a moment, small and sturdy under his, curved around the wooden bowl. Her smile deepened; then she pulled away, rising up to go and fetch more food.

He watched her go, appreciating the sway of her walk. Then his eye caught Sun Elkâ€”watching, too, from the doorway of his own apartment.

Bastard, Ian thought, very clearly.



â€œSEE, WE GOT ON WELL enough to start,â€ Ian explained. â€œHeâ€™s a bonny man, for the most part, Sun Elk.â€

â€œFor the most part,â€ Brianna echoed. She sat still, watching him. â€œAnd which part was that?â€

Ian rubbed a hand through his hair, making it stand up like the bushy quills on a porcupine.

â€œWell . . . the friend part. We were friends, to begin with, aye? Brothers, in fact; we were of the same clan.â€

â€œAnd you stopped being friends because ofâ€”of your wife?â€

Ian sighed deeply.

â€œWell, ye see . . . the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka, theyâ€™ve a notion of marriage thatâ€”itâ€™s like what ye see in the Highlands, often enough. That is, the parents have a good deal to do wiâ€™ arranging it. Often enough, theyâ€™ve watched the weans as they grew, and seen if maybe there was a lad and a lassie that seemed well-matched. And if they wereâ€”and if they came from the proper clansâ€”now, that bitâ€™s different, see?â€ he added, breaking off.

â€œThe clans?â€

â€œAye. In the Highlands, yeâ€™d mostly marry within your own clan, save it was to make an alliance wiâ€™ another. Among the Iroquois nations, though, ye canna ever marry someone from your own clan, and ye can only marry someone from particular clans, not just any other.â€

â€œMama said the Iroquois reminded her a lot of Highlanders,â€ Brianna said, mildly amused. â€œRuthless, but entertaining, was how she put it, I think. Bar some of the torturing, maybe, and the burning your enemies alive.â€

â€œYour motherâ€™s no heard some of Uncle Jamieâ€™s stories about his grandsire, then,â€ he replied with a wry smile.

â€œWhat, Lord Lovat?â€

â€œNo, the otherâ€”Seaumais Ruaidhâ€”Red Jacob, him Uncle Jamieâ€™s named for. A wicked auld bugger, my Mam always said; heâ€™d put any Iroquois to shame for pure cruelty, from all Iâ€™ve heard of him.â€ He dismissed this tangent with a wave of the hand, though, returning to his explanation.

â€œWell, so, when the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka took me, and named me, I was adopted to the Wolf clan, aye?â€ he said, with an explanatory nod at Rollo, who had consumed the honeycomb, dead bees and all, and was now meditatively licking his paws.

â€œVery appropriate,â€ she murmured. â€œWhat clan was Sun Elk?â€

â€œWolf, of course. And Emilyâ€™s mother and grandmother and sisters were Turtle. But what I was sayingâ€”if a lad and lassie from properly different clans seemed maybe suited to each other, then the mothers would speakâ€”they call all the aunties â€˜mother,â€™ too,â€ he added. â€œSo there might be a good many mothers involved in the matter. But if all the mothers and grandmothers and aunties were to agree that it would be a good match . . .â€ He shrugged. â€œTheyâ€™d marry.â€

Brianna rocked back a little, arms around her knees.

â€œBut you didnâ€™t have a mother to speak for you.â€

â€œWell, I did wonder what my Mam would haâ€™ said, if sheâ€™d been there,â€ he said, and smiled, despite his seriousness.

Brianna, having met Ianâ€™s mother, laughed at the thought.

â€œAunt Jenny would be a match for any Mohawk, male or female,â€ she assured him. â€œBut what happened, then?â€

â€œI loved Emily,â€ he said very simply. â€œAnd she loved me.â€

This state of affairs, which rapidly became apparent to everyone in the village, caused considerable public comment. Wakyoâ€™teyehsnonhsa, Works with Her Hands, the girl Ian called Emily, had been widely expected to marry Sun Elk, who had been a visitor to her familyâ€™s hearth since childhood.

â€œBut there it was.â€ Ian spread his hands and shrugged. â€œShe loved me, and she said so.â€

When Ian had been taken into the Wolf clan, he had been given to foster parents, as wellâ€”the parents of the dead man in whose stead he had been adopted. His foster mother had been somewhat taken aback by the situation, but after discussing the matter with the other women of the Wolf clan, had gone to speak formally with Tewaktenyonh, Emilyâ€™s grandmotherâ€”and the most influential woman in the village.

â€œAnd so we married.â€ Dressed in their best, and accompanied by their parents, the two young people had sat together on a bench before the assembled people of the village, and exchanged basketsâ€”his containing the furs of sable and beaver, and a good knife, symbolizing his willingness to hunt for her and protect her; hers filled with grain and fruit and vegetables, symbolizing her willingness to plant, gather, and provide for him.

â€œAnd four moons later,â€ Ian added, â€œSun Elk wed Looking at the Sky, Emilyâ€™s sister.â€

Brianna raised one eyebrow.

â€œBut . . . ?â€

â€œAye, but.â€



IAN HAD THE GUN Jamie had left with him, a rare and valued item among the Indians, and he knew how to use it. He also knew how to track, to lie in ambush, to think like an animalâ€”other things of value that Uncle Jamie had left with him.

In consequence, he was a good hunter, and rapidly gained respect for his ability to bring in meat. Sun Elk was a decent hunterâ€”not the best, but capable. Many of the young men would joke and make remarks, denigrating each otherâ€™s skills and making fun; he did it himself. Still, there was a tone to Sun Elkâ€™s jests to Ian that now and then made one of the other men glance sharply at him, then away with the faintest of shrugs.

He had been inclined to ignore the man. Then he had seen Sun Elk look at Wakyoâ€™teyehsnonhsa, and everything became at once clear to him.

She had been going to the forest with some other girls, one day in late summer. They carried baskets for gathering; Wakyoâ€™teyehsnonhsa had an ax through her belt. One of the other girls had asked her whether she meant to find wood for another bowl like the one she had made for her mother; Works With Her Hands had saidâ€”with a quick, warm look toward Ian, who lounged nearby with the other young menâ€”that no, she wished to find a good red cedar, for wood to make a cradleboard.

The girls had giggled and embraced Wakyoâ€™teyehsnonhsa; the young men had grinned and prodded Ian knowingly in the ribs. And Ian had caught a glimpse of Sun Elkâ€™s face, hot eyes fixed on Emilyâ€™s straight back as she walked away.

Within one moon, Sun Elk had moved into the longhouse, husband to his wifeâ€™s sister, Looking at the Sky. The sistersâ€™ compartments were across from each other; they shared a hearth. Ian had seldom seen Sun Elk look at Emily againâ€”but he had seen him look carefully away, too many times.

â€œThere is a person who desires you,â€ he said to Emily one night. It was long past the hour of the wolf, deep night, and the longhouse slept around them. The child she carried obliged her to rise and make water; she had come back to their furs skin-chilled and with the fresh smell of pines in her hair.

â€œOh? Well, why not? Everyone else is asleep.â€ She had stretched luxuriously and kissed him, the small bulge of her belly smooth and hard against his.

â€œNot me. I meanâ€”of course this person desires you, too!â€ heâ€™d said hastily, as she drew back a bit, offended. He wrapped his arms about her in quick illustration. â€œI meanâ€”there is someone else.â€

â€œHmf.â€ Her voice was muffled, her breath warm against his chest. â€œThere are many who desire me. I am very, very good with my hands.â€ She gave him a brief demonstration, and he gasped, causing her to chuckle with satisfaction.

Rollo, who had accompanied her outside, crawled under the bed platform and curled up in his accustomed spot, chewing noisily at an itching spot near his tail.

A little later, they lay with the furs thrown back. The hide that hung over their doorway was pulled back, so the heat of the fire could come in, and he could see the shine of light on the moist gold skin of her shoulder, where she lay turned away from him. She reached back and put one of her clever hands on his, took his palm, and pressed it against her belly. The child inside had begun to stir; he felt a soft, sudden push against his palm, and his breath stilled in his throat.

â€œYou shouldnâ€™t worry,â€ Emily said very softly. â€œThis person desires only you.â€

He had slept well.

In the morning, though, he had sat by the hearth eating cornmeal mush, and Sun Elk, who had already eaten, walked by. He stopped and looked down at Ian.

â€œThis person dreamed about you, Wolfâ€™s Brother.â€

â€œDid you?â€ Ian said pleasantly. He felt the warmth rise up his throat, but kept his face relaxed. The Kahyenâ€™kehaka set great store by dreams. A good dream would have everyone in the longhouse discussing it for days. The look on Sun Elkâ€™s face didnâ€™t indicate that his dream about Ian had been a good one.

â€œThat dogâ€”â€ He nodded at Rollo, who lay sprawled inconveniently in the doorway of Ianâ€™s compartment, snoring. â€œI dreamed that it rose up over your couch, and seized you by the throat.â€

That was a menacing dream. A Kahnyenâ€™kehaka who believed such a dream might decide to kill the dog, lest it be a foretelling of ill fortune. But Ian was notâ€”not quiteâ€”Kahnyenâ€™kehaka.

Ian raised both brows, and went on eating. Sun Elk waited for a moment, but as Ian said nothing, eventually nodded and turned away.

â€œAhkoteâ€™ohskennonton,â€ Ian said, calling his name. The man turned back, expectant.

â€œThis person dreamed of you, too.â€ Sun Elk glanced sharply at him. Ian didnâ€™t speak further, but let a slow and evil smile grow upon his face.

Sun Elk stared at him. He kept smiling. The other man turned away with a snort of disgust, but not before Ian had seen the faint look of unease in Sun Elkâ€™s eyes.



â€œWELL, SO.â€ Ian took a deep breath. He closed his eyes briefly, then opened them. â€œYe ken the child died, aye?â€

He spoke with no emotion at all in his voice. It was that dry, controlled tone that seared her heart, and choked her so that she could do no more than nod in reply.

He couldnâ€™t keep it up, though. He opened his mouth as though to speak, but the big, bony hands clenched suddenly on his knees, and instead, he rose abruptly to his feet.

â€œAye,â€ he said. â€œLetâ€™s go. Iâ€™llâ€”Iâ€™ll tell ye the rest, walking.â€

And he did, his back resolutely turned, as he led her higher up the mountain, then across a narrow ridge, and down the path of a stream that fell in a series of small, enchanting waterfalls, each encircled with a mist of miniature rainbows.

Works with Her Hands had conceived again. That child was lost just after her belly began to swell with life.

â€œThey say, the Kahnyenâ€™kehaka,â€ Ian explained, his voice muffled as he shoved his way through a screen of brilliant red creeper, â€œthat for a woman to conceive, her husbandâ€™s spirit does battle with hers, and must overcome it. If his spirit isna strong enoughâ€â€”his voice came clear as he ripped a handful of creeper down, breaking the branch it hung from, and cast it viciously awayâ€”â€œthen the child canna take root in the womb.â€

After this second loss, the Medicine Society had taken the two of them to a private hut, there to sing and beat drums and to dance in huge painted masks, meant to frighten away whatever evil entities might be hampering Ianâ€™s spiritâ€”or unduly strengthening Emilyâ€™s.

â€œI wanted to laugh, seeing the masks,â€ Ian said. He didnâ€™t turn round; yellow leaves spangled the shoulders of his buckskin and stuck in his hair. â€œThey call it the Funny-Face Society, tooâ€”and for a reason. Didna do it, though.â€

â€œI donâ€™t . . . suppose Em-Emily laughed.â€ He was going so fast that she was pressed to keep up with him, though her legs were nearly as long as his own.

â€œNo,â€ he said, and uttered a short, bitter laugh himself. â€œShe didna.â€

She had gone into the medicine hut beside him silent and gray, but had come out with a peaceful face, and reached for him in their bed that night with love. For three months, they had made love with tenderness and ardor. For another three, they had made love with a sense of increasing desperation.

â€œAnd then she missed her courses again.â€

He had at once ceased his attentions, terrified of causing a further mishap. Emily had moved slowly and carefully, no longer going into the fields to work, but staying in the longhouse, working, always working, with her hands. Weaving, grinding, carving, boring beads of shell for wampum, hands moving ceaselessly, to compensate for the waiting stillness of her body.

â€œHer sister went to the fields. Itâ€™s the women who do, ken?â€ He paused to slash an outreaching brier with his knife, tossing the severed branch out of the way so it wouldnâ€™t snap back and hit Brianna in the face.

â€œLooking at the Sky brought us food. All the women did, but her most of all. She was a sweet lass, KarÃ²nya.â€

There was a slight catch in his voice at this, the first in his harsh recitation of facts.

â€œWhat happened to her?â€ Brianna hastened her step a little as they came out onto the top of a grass-covered bank, so that she drew up nearly even with him. He slowed a little, but didnâ€™t turn to look at herâ€”kept his face forward, chin raised as though confronting enemies.

â€œTaken.â€ Looking at the Sky had been in the habit of staying later in the fields than the other women, gathering extra corn or squash for her sister and Ian, though she had a child of her own by then. One evening, she did not return to the longhouse, and when the villagers had gone out to search for her, neither she nor the child was anywhere to be found. They had vanished, leaving only one pale moccasin behind, tangled in the squash vines at the edge of a field.

â€œAbenaki,â€ Ian said tersely. â€œWe found the sign next day; it was full dark before we began to search in earnest.â€

It had been a long night searching, followed by a week of the sameâ€”a week of growing fear and emptinessâ€”and Ian had returned to his wifeâ€™s hearth at dawn on the seventh day, to learn that she had miscarried once more.

He paused. He was sweating freely from walking so fast, and wiped a sleeve across his chin. Brianna could feel the sweat trickling down her own back, dampening the hunting shirt, but disregarded it. She touched his back, very gently, but said nothing.

He heaved a deep sigh, almost of relief, she thoughtâ€”perhaps that the dreadful tale was nearly done.

â€œWe tried a bit longer,â€ he said, back to the matter-of-fact tone. â€œEmily and I. But the heart had gone out of her. She didna trust me any longer. And . . . Ahkoteâ€™ohskennonton was there. He ate at our hearth. And he watched her. She began to look back.â€

Ian had been shaping wood for a bow one day, concentrating on the flow of the grain beneath his knife, trying to see those things in the swirls that Emily saw, to hear the voice of the tree, as she had told him. It wasnâ€™t the tree that spoke behind him, though.

â€œGrandson,â€ said a dry old voice, lightly ironic.

He dropped the knife, narrowly missing his own foot, and swung round, bow in hand. Tewaktenyonh stood six feet away, one eyebrow lifted in amusement at having sneaked up on him unheard.

â€œGrandmother,â€ he said, and nodded in wry acknowledgment of her skill. Ancient she might be, but no one moved more softly. Hence her reputation; the children of the village lived in respectful dread of her, having heard that she could vanish into air, only to rematerialize in some distant spot, right before the guilty eyes of evil-doers.

â€œCome with me, Wolfâ€™s Brother,â€ she said, and turned away, not waiting for his response. None was expected.

She was already out of sight by the time he had laid the half-made bow under a bush, taken up his fallen knife, and whistled for Rollo, but he caught her up with no difficulty.

She had led him away from the village, through the forest, to the head of a deer trail. There she had given him a bag of salt and an armlet of wampum and bade him go.

â€œAnd you went?â€ Brianna asked, after a long moment of silence. â€œJustâ€”like that?â€

â€œJust like that,â€ he said, and looked at her for the first time since they had left their campsite that morning. His face was gaunt, hollow with memories. Sweat gleamed on his cheekbones, but he was so pale that the dotted lines of his tattoos stood out sharpâ€”perforations, lines along which his face might come apart.

She swallowed a few times before she could speak, but managed a tone much like his own when she did.

â€œIs it much farther?â€ she asked. â€œWhere weâ€™re going?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said softly. â€œWeâ€™re nearly there.â€ And turned to walk again before her.



HALF AN HOUR LATER, they had reached a place where the stream cut deep between its banks, widening into a small gorge. Silver birch and hobblebush grew thick, sprouting from the rocky walls, smooth-skinned roots twisting through the stones like fingers clawing at the earth.

The notion gave Brianna a slight prickle at the neck. The waterfalls were far above them now, and the noise of the water had lessened, the creek talking to itself as it purled over rocks and shushed through mats of cress and duckweed.

She thought the going might be easier above, on the lip of the gorge, but Ian led her down into it without hesitation, and she followed likewise, scrambling over the tumble of boulders and tree roots, hampered by her long gun. Rollo, scorning this clumsy exertion, plunged into the creek, which was several feet deep, and swam, ears clamped back against his head so that he looked like a giant otter.

Ian had recovered his self-possession in the concentration of navigating the rough ground. He paused now and then, reaching back to help her down a particularly tricky fall of rock, or over a tree uprooted in some recent floodâ€”but he didnâ€™t meet her eyes, and the shuttered planes of his face gave nothing away.

Her curiosity had reached fever pitch, but clearly he had done speaking for the moment. It was just past midday, but the light under the birches was a shadowed gold that made everything seem somehow hushed, almost enchanted. She could make no sensible guess as to the purpose of this expedition, in light of what Ian had told herâ€”but the place was one where almost anything seemed possible.

She thought suddenly of her first fatherâ€”of Frank Randallâ€”and felt a small, remembered warmth at the thought. She would like so much to show him this place.

They had taken holidays often in the Adirondacks; different mountains, different treesâ€”but something of the same hush and mystery in the shadowed glades and rushing water. Her mother had come sometimes, but more often it was just the two of them, hiking far up into the trees, not talking much, but sharing a deep content in the company of the sky.

Suddenly, the sound of the water rose again; there was another fall nearby.

â€œJust here, coz,â€ Ian said softly, and beckoned her to follow with a turn of the head.

They stepped out from under the trees and she saw that the gorge dropped suddenly away, the water falling twenty feet or more into a pool below. Ian led her past the head of the falls; she could hear the water rushing past below, but the top of the bank was thick with sedges, and they had to push their way through, tramping down the yellowing stems of goldenrod and dodging the panicked whir of grasshoppers rocketing up underfoot.

â€œLook,â€ Ian said, glancing back, and reached to part the screen of laurel in front of her.

â€œWow!â€

She recognized it immediately. There was no mistaking it, in spite of the fact that much of it was invisible, still buried in the crumbling bank on the far side of the gorge. Some recent flood had raised the level of the creek, undercutting the bank so that a huge block of stone and dirt had fallen away, revealing its buried mystery.

The raked arches of ribs rose huge from the dirt, and she had the impression of a scatter of things half-buried in the rubble at the foot of the bank: enormous things, knobbed and twisted. They might be bones or simply bouldersâ€”but it was the tusk that caught her eye, jutting from the bank in a massive curve, intensely familiar, and the more startling for its very familiarity.

â€œYe ken it?â€ Ian asked eagerly, watching her face. â€œYeâ€™ve seen something like it?â€

â€œOh, yes,â€ she said, and though the sun was warm on her back, she shivered, gooseflesh pebbling her forearms. Not from fear, but sheer awe at sight of it, and a kind of incredulous joy. â€œOh, yes. I have.â€

â€œWhat?â€ Ianâ€™s voice was still pitched low, as though the creature might hear them. â€œWhat is it?â€

â€œA mammoth,â€ she said, and found that she was whispering, too. The sun had passed its zenith; already the bottom of the creekbed lay in shadow. Light struck the stained curve of ancient ivory, and threw the vault of the high-crowned skull that held it into sharp relief. The skull was fixed in the soil at a slight angle, the single visible tusk rising high, the eye socket black as mystery.

The shiver came again, and she hunched her shoulders. Easy to feel that it might at any moment wrench itself free of the clay and turn that massive head toward them, empty-eyed, clods of dirt raining from tusks and bony shoulders as it shook itself and began to walk, the ground vibrating as long toes struck and sank in the muddy soil.

â€œThatâ€™s what itâ€™s calledâ€”mammoth? Aye, well . . . it is verra big.â€ Ianâ€™s voice dispelled the illusion of incipient movement, and she was able finally to take her eyes off itâ€”though she felt she must glance back, every second or so, to be sure it was still there.

â€œThe Latin name is Mammuthus,â€ she said, clearing her throat. â€œThereâ€™s a complete skeleton in a museum in New York. Iâ€™ve seen it often. And Iâ€™ve seen pictures of them in books.â€ She glanced back at the creature in the bank.

â€œA museum? So itâ€™s not a thing yeâ€™ve got whereâ€”whenâ€â€”he stumbled a bitâ€”â€œwhere ye come from? Not alive then, I mean?â€ He seemed rather disappointed.

She wanted to laugh at the picture of mammoths roaming Boston Common, or wallowing on the bank of the Cambridge River. In fact, she had a momentâ€™s pang of disappointment that they hadnâ€™t been there; it would have been so wonderful to see them.

â€œNo,â€ she said regretfully. â€œThey all died thousands and thousands of years ago. When the ice came.â€

â€œIce?â€ Ian was glancing back and forth between her and the mammoth, as though afraid one or the other might do something untoward.

â€œThe Ice Age. The world got colder, and sheets of ice spread down from the north. A lot of animals went extinctâ€”I mean, they couldnâ€™t find food, and all died.â€

Ian was pale with excitement.

â€œAye. Aye, Iâ€™ve heard such stories.â€

â€œYou have?â€ She was surprised at that.

â€œAye. But ye say itâ€™s real.â€ He swung his head to look at the mammothâ€™s bones once more. â€œAn animal, aye, like a bear or a possum?â€

â€œYes,â€ she said, puzzled by his attitude, which seemed to alternate between eagerness and dismay. â€œBigger, but yes. What else would it be?â€

â€œAh,â€ he said, and took a deep breath. â€œWell, dâ€™ye see, thatâ€™s what I needed ye to tell me, coz. See, the Kahnyenâ€™kehakaâ€”they have stories of . . . things. Animals that are really spirits. And if ever I saw a thing that might be a spiritâ€”â€ He was still looking at the skeleton, as though it might walk out of the earth, and she saw a slight shiver pass through him.

She couldnâ€™t prevent a similar shiver, looking at the massive creature. It towered above them, grim and awful, and only her knowledge of what it was kept her from wanting to cower and run.

â€œItâ€™s real,â€ she repeated, as much to reassure herself as him. â€œAnd itâ€™s dead. Really dead.â€

â€œHow dâ€™ye know these things?â€ he asked, intently curious. â€œItâ€™s auld, ye say. Youâ€™d be much further away fromâ€”thatâ€â€”he jerked his chin at the giant skeletonâ€”â€œin your own time than we are now. How can ye ken more about it than folk do now?â€

She shook her head, smiling a little, and helpless to explain.

â€œWhen did you find this, Ian?â€

â€œLast month. I came up the gorgeâ€â€”he gestured with his chinâ€”â€œand there it was. I near beshit myself.â€

â€œI can imagine,â€ she said, stifling an urge to laugh.

â€œAye,â€ he said, not noticing her amusement in his desire to explain. â€œI should have been sure that it was Rawenniyoâ€”a spirit, a godâ€”save for the dog.â€

Rollo had climbed out of the stream, and having shaken the water from his fur, was squirming on his back in a patch of crushed turtlehead, tail wagging in pleasure, and clearly oblivious to the silent giant in the cliff above.

â€œWhat do you mean? That Rollo wasnâ€™t afraid of it?â€

Ian nodded.

â€œAye. He didna behave as though there were anything there at all. And yet . . .â€ He hesitated, darting a glance at her. â€œSometimes, in the wood. Heâ€”he sees things. Things I canna see. Ken?â€

â€œI ken,â€ she said, a ripple of unease returning. â€œDogs do see . . . things.â€ She remembered her own dogs; in particular, Smoky, the big Newfoundland, who would sometimes in the evening suddenly raise his head, listening, hackles rising as his eyes followed . . . something . . . that passed through the room and disappeared.

He nodded, relieved that she knew what he was talking about.

â€œThey do. I ran, when I saw thatâ€â€”he nodded at the cliffâ€”â€œand ducked behind a tree. But the dog went on about his business, paying it no mind. And so I thought, well, just maybe itâ€™s no what I think, after all.â€

â€œAnd what did you think?â€ she asked. â€œA Rawenniyo, you said?â€ As the excitement of seeing the mammoth began to recede, she remembered what they were theoretically doing here. â€œIanâ€”you said what you wanted to show me had to do with your wife. Is thisâ€”â€ She gestured toward the cliff, brows raised.

He didnâ€™t answer directly, but tilted his head back, studying the jut of the giant tusks.

â€œI heard stories, now and then. Among the Mohawk, I mean. Theyâ€™d speak of strange things that someone found, hunting. Spirits trapped in the rock, and how they came to be there. Evil things, for the most part. And I thought to myself, if that should be what this is . . .â€

He broke off and turned to her, serious and intent.

â€œI needed ye to tell me, aye? Whether thatâ€™s what it is or no. Because if it was, then perhaps what Iâ€™ve been thinking is wrong.â€

â€œItâ€™s not,â€ she assured him. â€œBut what on earth have you been thinking?â€

â€œAbout God,â€ he said, surprising her again. He licked his lips, unsure how to go on.

â€œYeksaâ€™aâ€”the child. I didna have her christened,â€ he said. â€œI couldna. Or perhaps I couldâ€”ye can do it yourself, ken, if thereâ€™s no priest. But I hadna the courage to try. Iâ€”never saw her. Theyâ€™d wrapped her already. . . . They wouldna have liked it, if Iâ€™d tried to . . .â€ His voice died away.

â€œYeksaâ€™a,â€ she said softly. â€œWas that yourâ€”your daughterâ€™s name?â€

He shook his head, his mouth twisting wryly.

â€œIt only means â€˜wee girl.â€™ The Kahnyenâ€™kehaka dinna give a name to a child when itâ€™s born. Not until later. If . . .â€ His voice trailed off, and he cleared his throat. â€œIf it lives. They wouldna think of naming a child unborn.â€

â€œBut you did?â€ she asked gently.

He raised his head and took a breath that had a damp sound to it, like wet bandages pulled from a fresh wound.

â€œIseabaÃ¬l,â€ he said, and she knew it was the firstâ€”perhaps would be the onlyâ€”time heâ€™d spoken it aloud. â€œHad it been a son, I would haâ€™ called him Jamie.â€ He glanced at her, with the shadow of a smile. â€œOnly in my head, ken.â€

He let out all his breath then with a sigh and put his face down upon his knees, back hunched.

â€œWhat I am thinking,â€ he said after a moment, his voice much too controlled, â€œis this. Was it me?â€

â€œIan! You mean your fault that the baby died? How could it be?â€

â€œI left,â€ he said simply, straightening up. â€œTurned away. Stopped being a Christian, being Scots. They took me to the stream, scrubbed me wiâ€™ sand to take away the white blood. They gave me my nameâ€”Okwahoâ€™kenhaâ€”and said I was Mohawk. But I wasna, not really.â€

He sighed deeply again, and she put a hand on his back, feeling the bumps of his backbone press through the leather of his shirt. He didnâ€™t eat nearly enough, she thought.

â€œBut I wasna what I had been, either,â€ he went on, sounding almost matter-of-fact. â€œI tried to be what they wanted, ken? So I left off praying to God or the Virgin Mother, or Saint Bride. I listened to what Emily said, when sheâ€™d tell me about her gods, the spirits that dwell in the trees and all. And when I went to the sweat lodge wiâ€™ the men, or sat by the hearth and heard the stories . . . they seemed as real to me as Christ and His saints ever had.â€

He turned his head and looked up at her suddenly, half-bewildered, half-defiant.

â€œI am the Lord thy God,â€ he said. â€œThou shalt have no other gods before me. But I did, no? Thatâ€™s mortal sin, is it not?â€

She wanted to say no, of course not. Or to protest weakly that she was not a priest, how could she say? But neither of those would do; he was not looking for easy reassurance, and a weak-minded abnegation of responsibility would not serve him.

She took a deep breath and blew it out. It had been a good many years since sheâ€™d been taught the Baltimore Catechism, but it wasnâ€™t the sort of thing you forget.

â€œThe conditions of mortal sin are these,â€ she said, reciting the words precisely from memory. â€œFirst, that the action be grievously wrong. Secondly, that you know the action is wrong. And thirdlyâ€”that you give full consent to it.â€

He was watching her intently.

â€œWell, it was wrong, and I suppose I kent thatâ€”aye, I did ken that. Especiallyâ€”â€ His face darkened further, and she wondered what he was recalling.

â€œBut . . . how should I serve a God who would take a child for her fatherâ€™s sins?â€ Without waiting for an answer, he glanced toward the cliff face, where the remains of the mammoth lay frozen in time. â€œOr was it them? Was it not my God at all, but the Iroquois spirits? Did they ken I wasna really Mohawkâ€”that I held back a part of myself from them?â€

He looked back at her, dead serious.

â€œGods are jealous, are they no?â€

â€œIan . . .â€ She swallowed, helpless. But she had to say something.

â€œWhat you didâ€”or didnâ€™t doâ€”that wasnâ€™t wrong, Ian,â€ she said firmly. â€œYour daughter . . . she was half-Mohawk. It wasnâ€™t wrong to let her be buried according to her motherâ€™s ways. Your wifeâ€”Emilyâ€”she would have been terribly upset, wouldnâ€™t she, if youâ€™d insisted on baptizing the baby?â€

â€œAye, maybe. But . . .â€ He closed his eyes, hands clenched hard into fists on his thighs. â€œWhere is she, then?â€ he whispered, and she could see tears trembling on his lashes. â€œThe othersâ€”they were never born; God will have them in His hand. But wee IseabaÃ¬lâ€”sheâ€™ll not be in heaven, will she? I canna bear the thought that sheâ€”that she might be . . . lost, somewhere. Wandering.â€

â€œIan . . .â€

â€œI hear her, greeting. In the night.â€ His breath was coming in deep, sobbing gasps. â€œI canna help, I canna find her!â€

â€œIan!â€ The tears were running down her own cheeks. She gripped his wrists fiercely, squeezed as hard as she could. â€œIan, listen to me!â€

He drew a deep, trembling breath, head bent. Then he nodded, very slightly.

She rose onto her knees and gathered him tight against her, his head cradled on her breasts. Her cheek pressed against the top of his head, his hair warm and springy against her mouth.

â€œListen to me,â€ she said softly. â€œI had another father. The man who raised me. Heâ€™s dead now.â€ For a long time now, the sense of desolation at his loss had been muted, softened by new love, distracted by new obligations. Now it swept over her, newly fresh, and sharp as a stab wound in its agony. â€œI knowâ€”I know heâ€™s in heaven.â€

Was he? Could he be dead and in heaven, if not yet born? And yet he was dead to her, and surely heaven took no heed of time.

She lifted her face toward the cliff, but spoke to neither bones nor God.

â€œDaddy,â€ she said, and her voice broke on the word, but she held her cousin hard. â€œDaddy, I need you.â€ Her voice sounded small, and pathetically unsure. But there was no other help to be had.

â€œI need you to find Ianâ€™s little girl,â€ she said, as firmly as she could, trying to summon her fatherâ€™s face, to see him there among the shifting leaves at the clifftop. â€œFind her, please. Hold her in your arms, and make sure that sheâ€™s safe. Takeâ€”please take care of her.â€

She stopped, feeling obscurely that she should say something else, something more ceremonious. Make the sign of the cross? Say â€œamenâ€?

â€œThank you, Daddy,â€ she said softly, and cried as though her father were newly dead, and she bereft, orphaned, lost, and crying in the night. Ianâ€™s arms were wrapped around her, and they clung tight together, squeezing hard, the warmth of the late sun heavy on their heads.

She stood still within his arms when she stopped crying, her head resting on his shoulder. He patted her back, very gently, but didnâ€™t push her away.

â€œThank you,â€ he whispered in her ear. â€œAre ye all right, Brianna?â€

â€œUh-huh.â€ She straightened and stood away from him, swaying a little, as though she were drunk. She felt drunk, too, her bones gone soft and malleable, everything around her faintly out of focus, save for certain things that caught her eye: a brilliant patch of pink ladyâ€™s slipper, a stone fallen from the cliff face, its surface streaked red with iron. Rollo, almost sitting on Ianâ€™s foot, big head pressed anxiously against his masterâ€™s thigh.

â€œAre you all right, Ian?â€ she asked.

â€œI will be.â€ His hand sought Rolloâ€™s head, and gave the pointed ears a cursory rub of reassurance. â€œMaybe. Just . . .â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œAre ye . . . are ye sure, Brianna?â€

She knew what he was asking; it was a question of faith. She drew herself up to her full height, wiping her nose on her sleeve.

â€œIâ€™m a Roman Catholic and I believe in vitamins,â€ she declared stoutly. â€œAnd I knew my father. Of course Iâ€™m sure.â€

He took a deep, sighing breath and his shoulders slumped as he let it out. He nodded then, and the lines of his face relaxed a little.

She left him sitting on a rock, and made her way down to the stream to splash cold water on her face. The shadow of the cliff fell across the creek and the air was cold with the scents of earth and pine trees. In spite of the chill, she remained there for a while, on her knees.

She could still hear the voices murmuring in trees and water, but paid no attention to them. Whoever they were, they were no threat to her or hersâ€”and not at odds with the presence that she felt so strongly nearby.

â€œI love you, Daddy,â€ she whispered, closing her eyes, and felt at peace.

Ian must be better, too, she thought, when she made her way at length back through the rocks to where he sat. Rollo had left him to investigate a promising hole at the foot of a tree, and she knew the dog wouldnâ€™t have left Ian, had he considered his master to be in distress.

She was about to ask him whether their business here was complete, when he stood up, and she saw that it wasnâ€™t.

â€œWhy I brought ye here,â€ he said abruptly. â€œI wanted to know about thatâ€”â€ He nodded at the mammoth. â€œBut I meant to ask ye a question. Advice, like.â€

â€œAdvice? Ian, I canâ€™t give you any advice! How could I tell you what to do?â€

â€œI think yeâ€™re maybe the only one who can,â€ he said with a lopsided smile. â€œYouâ€™re my family, youâ€™re a womanâ€”and ye care for me. Yet ye ken more even than Uncle Jamie, perhaps, because of whoâ€”or whatâ€â€”his mouth twisted a littleâ€”â€œye are.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know more,â€ she said, and looked up at the bones in the rock. â€œOnlyâ€”different things.â€

â€œAye,â€ he said, and took a deep breath.

â€œBrianna,â€ he said very softly. â€œWeâ€™re no wedâ€”we never shall be.â€ He looked away for an instant, then back. â€œBut if we had been marrit, I should have loved ye and cared for ye, so well as I could. I trust you, that yeâ€™d have done the same by me. Am I right?â€

â€œOh, Ian.â€ Her throat was still thick, raspy with grief; the words came out in a whisper. She touched his face, cool-skinned and bony, and traced the line of tattooed dots with a thumb. â€œI love you now.â€

â€œAye, well,â€ he said still softly. â€œI ken that.â€ He lifted a hand and put it over her own, big and hard. He pressed her palm against his cheek for a moment, then his fingers closed over hers and he brought their linked hands down, but didnâ€™t let go.

â€œSo tell me,â€ he said, his eyes not leaving hers. â€œIf ye love me, tell me what I shall do. Shall I go back?â€

â€œBack,â€ she repeated, searching his face. â€œBack to the Mohawk, you mean?â€

He nodded.

â€œBack to Emily. She loved me,â€ he said quietly. â€œI ken that. Did I do wrong, to let the old woman send me away? Ought I to go back, maybe fight for her, if I had to? Perhaps see if she would come away wiâ€™ me, back to the Ridge.â€

â€œOh, Ian.â€ She felt the same sense of helplessness as before, though this time it came without the burden of her own grief. But who was she to tell him anything? How could she be responsible for making that decision for himâ€”for saying to him, stay, or go?

His eyes stayed steady on her face, though, and it came over herâ€”she was his family. And so the responsibility lay in her hands, whether she felt adequate to it or not.

Her chest felt tight, as though she might burst if she took a deep breath. She took it anyway.

â€œStay,â€ she said.

He stood looking into her eyes for a long time, his own deep hazel, gold-flecked and serious.

â€œYou could fight himâ€”Ahk . . .â€ She fumbled for the syllables of the Mohawk name. â€œSun Elk. But you canâ€™t fight her. If sheâ€™s made up her mind that she doesnâ€™t want to be with you anymore . . . Ian, you canâ€™t change it.â€

He blinked, dark lashes cutting off his gaze, and kept his eyes closed, whether in acknowledgement or denial of what sheâ€™d said, she didnâ€™t know.

â€œBut itâ€™s more than that,â€ she said, her voice growing firmer. â€œIt isnâ€™t only her, or him. Is it?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said. His voice sounded distant, almost uncaring, but she knew it wasnâ€™t that.

â€œItâ€™s them,â€ she said more softly. â€œAll the mothers. The grandmothers. The women. Theâ€”the children.â€ Clan and family and tribe and nation; custom, spirit, traditionâ€”the strands that wrapped Works with Her Hands and held her to the earth, secure. And above all, children. Those loud small voices that drowned the voices of the wood, and kept a soul from wandering through the night.

No one knew the strength of such bonds better than one who had walked the earth without them, outcast and alone. She had, and he had, and they both knew the truth.

â€œItâ€™s them,â€ he echoed softly, and opened his eyes. They were dark with loss, the color of shadows in the deepest wood. â€œAnd them.â€ He turned his head, to look upward, into the trees beyond the creek, above the bones of the mammoth that lay trapped in the earth, stripped to the sky and mute to all prayer. He turned back, raised a hand, and touched her cheek.

â€œIâ€™ll stay, then.â€



THEY CAMPED FOR the night on the far side of the beaver pond. The litter of wood chips and debarked saplings made good kindling for their fire.

There was little to eat; no more than a hatful of bitter fox-grapes and the heel of bread, so hard by now that it had to be dunked in water to chew. It didnâ€™t matter; neither one of them was hungry, and Rollo had disappeared to hunt for himself.

They sat silently, watching the fire die down. There was no need to keep it going; the night was not cold, and they would not linger in the morningâ€”home was too near.

At last, Ian stirred a bit, and Brianna glanced at him.

â€œWhat was your fatherâ€™s name?â€ he asked very formally.

â€œFrankâ€”er . . . Franklin. Franklin Wolverton Randall.â€

â€œAn Englishman, then?â€

â€œVery,â€ she said, smiling in spite of herself.

He nodded, murmuring â€œFranklin Wolverton Randallâ€ to himself, as though to commit it to memory, then looked at her seriously.

â€œIf ever I find myself in a church again, then, I shall light a candle to his memory.â€

â€œI expect . . . heâ€™d like that.â€

He nodded, and leaned back, back braced against a longleaf pine. The ground nearby was littered with the cones; he picked up a handful and tossed them, one by one, into the fire.

â€œWhat about Lizzie?â€ she asked after a little while. â€œSheâ€™s always been fond of you.â€ To put it mildly: Lizzie had wilted and pined for weeks, when he had been lost to the Iroquois. â€œAnd now that sheâ€™s not marrying Manfred . . .â€

He tilted back his head, eyes closed, and rested it against the trunk of the pine.

â€œIâ€™ve thought of it,â€ he admitted.

â€œBut . . . ?â€

â€œAye, but.â€ He opened his eyes and gave her a wry look. â€œIâ€™d ken where I was, if I woke beside her. But where Iâ€™d be is in bed wiâ€™ my wee sister. I think Iâ€™m maybe not so desperate as that. Yet,â€ he added as an obvious afterthought.

BLACK PUDDING




I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF a black pudding when Ronnie Sinclair appeared in the yard, carrying two small whisky casks. Several more were bound in a neatly corrugated cascade down his back, which made him look like some exotic form of caterpillar, balanced precariously upright in mid-pupation. It was a chilly day, but he was sweating freely from the long walk uphillâ€”and cursing in similar vein.

â€œWhy in the name of Bride did Himself build the frigging house up here in the godforsaken clouds?â€ he demanded without ceremony. â€œWhy not where a bloody wagon could reach the yard?â€ He set the casks down carefully, then ducked his head through the straps of the harness to shed his wooden carapace. He sighed in relief, rubbing at his shoulders where the straps had dug.

I ignored the rhetorical questions, and kept stirring, tilting my head toward the house in invitation.

â€œThereâ€™s fresh coffee made,â€ I said. â€œAnd bannocks with honey, too.â€ My own stomach recoiled slightly at the thought of eating. Once spiced, stuffed, boiled, and fried, black pudding was delicious. The earlier stages, involving as they did arm-deep manipulations in a barrel of semi-coagulated pigâ€™s blood, were substantially less appetizing.

Sinclair, though, looked happier at mention of food. He wiped a sleeve across his sweating forehead and nodded to me, turning toward the house. Then he stopped and turned back.

â€œAh. Iâ€™d forgot, missus. Iâ€™ve a wee message for yourself, as well.â€ He patted gingerly at his chest, then lower, probing around his ribs until he at length found what he was looking for and extracted it from the layers of his sweat-soaked clothing. He pulled out a damp wad of paper and held it out to me in expectation, ignoring the fact that my right arm was coated with blood nearly to the shoulder, and the left in scarcely better case.

â€œPut it in the kitchen, why donâ€™t you?â€ I suggested. â€œHimselfâ€™s inside. Iâ€™ll come as soon as Iâ€™ve got this lot sorted. Whoâ€”â€ I started to ask whom the letter was from, but tactfully altered this to, â€œWho gave it to you?â€ Ronnie couldnâ€™t readâ€”though I saw no marks on the outside of the note, in any case.

â€œA tinker on his way to Belemâ€™s Creek handed it to me,â€ he said. â€œHe didna say who gave it himâ€”only that it was for the healer.â€

He frowned at the wadded paper, but I saw his eyes slide sideways toward my legs. In spite of the chill, I was barefoot and stripped to my chemise and stays, no more than a smeared apron wrapped around my waist. Ronnie had been looking for a wife for some little time, and in consequence had formed the unconscious habit of appraising the physical attributes of every woman he encountered, without regard to age or availability. He noticed my noticing, and hastily jerked his gaze away.

â€œThat was all?â€ I asked. â€œThe healer? He didnâ€™t give my name?â€

Sinclair rubbed a hand through thinning ginger hair, so two spikes stood up over his reddened ears, increasing his naturally sly, foxy look.

â€œDidna have to, did he?â€ Without further attempts at conversation, he disappeared into the house, in search of food and Jamie, leaving me to my sanguinary labors.

The worst part was cleaning the blood: swishing an arm through the dark, reeking depths of the barrel to collect the threads of fibrin that formed as the blood began to clot. These clung to my arm and could then be pulled out and rinsed awayâ€”repeatedly. At that, it was slightly less nasty than the job of washing out the intestines to be used for the sausage casings; Brianna and Lizzie were doing that, down at the creek.

I peered at the latest results; no fibers visible in the clear red liquid that dripped from my fingers. I dunked my arm again in the water cask that stood beside the blood barrel, balanced on boards laid across a pair of trestles under the big chestnut tree. Jamie and Roger and Arch Bug had dragged the pigâ€”not the white sow, but one of her many offspring from a prior yearâ€”into the yard, clubbed it between the eyes with a maul, then swung it up into the branches, slit the throat, and let the blood drain into the barrel.

Roger and Arch had then taken the disemboweled carcass away to be scalded and the bristles scraped off; Jamieâ€™s presence was required to deal with Major MacDonald, who had appeared suddenly, puffing and wheezing from the climb up to the Ridge. Between the two, I thought Jamie would much have preferred to deal with the pig.

I finished washing my hands and armsâ€”wasted labor, but necessary to my peace of mindâ€”and dried off with a linen towel. I shoveled double handsful into the barrel from the waiting bowls of barley, oatmeal, and boiled rice, smiling slightly at memory of the Majorâ€™s plum-red face, and Ronnie Sinclairâ€™s complaints. Himself had picked his building site on the Ridge with a great deal of forethoughtâ€”precisely because of the difficulties involved in reaching it.

I ran my fingers through my hair, then took a deep breath and plunged my clean arm back into the barrel. The blood was cooling rapidly. Doused by the cereal, the smell was less immediate now than the metallic reek of fresh, hot blood. The mixture was still warm to the touch, though, and the grains made graceful swirls of white and brown, pale whirlpools drawn down into the blood as I stirred.

Ronnie was right; it hadnâ€™t been necessary to identify me further than â€œthe healer.â€ There wasnâ€™t another closer than Cross Creek, unless one counted the shamans among the Indiansâ€”which most Europeans wouldnâ€™t.

I wondered who had sent the note, and whether the matter was urgent. Probably notâ€”at least it was not likely to be a matter of imminent childbirth or serious accident. Word of such events was likely to arrive in person, carried urgently by a friend or relative. A written message entrusted to a tinker couldnâ€™t be counted on to be delivered with any sort of promptitude; tinkers wandered or stayed, depending on what work they found.

For that matter, tinkers and tramps seldom came so far as the Ridge, though we had seen three within the last month. I didnâ€™t know whether that was the result of our growing populationâ€”Fraserâ€™s Ridge boasted nearly sixty families now, though the cabins were scattered over ten miles of forested mountain slopesâ€”or something more sinister.

â€œItâ€™s one of the signs, Sassenach,â€ Jamie had told me, frowning after the departing form of the last such temporary guest. â€œWhen there is war in the air, men take to the roads.â€

I thought he was right; I remembered wanderers on the Highland roads, carrying rumors of the Stuart Rising. It was as though the tremors of unrest jarred loose those who were not firmly attached to a place by love of land or family, and the swirling currents of dissension bore them onward, the first premonitory fragments of a slow-motion explosion that would shatter everything. I shivered, the light breeze touching cold through my shift.

The mass of gruel had reached the necessary consistency, something like a very thick, dark-red cream. I shook clumps of clotted grain from my fingers and reached with my clean left hand for the wooden bowl of minced and sauteed onions, standing ready. The strong smell of the onions overlaid the scent of butchery, pleasantly domestic.

The salt was ground, so was the pepper. All I needed now . . . as if on cue, Roger appeared around the corner of the house, a large basin in his hands, filled with fine-chopped pork fat.

â€œJust in time!â€ I said, and nodded toward the barrel. â€œNo, donâ€™t dump it in, it has to be measuredâ€”roughly.â€ Iâ€™d used ten double handsful of oatmeal, ten of rice, ten of barley. Half that total, thenâ€”fifteen. I shook back the hair from my eyes again, and carefully scooped up a double handful of the basinâ€™s content, dropping it into the barrel with a splat.

â€œAll right, are you?â€ I asked. I gestured toward a stool with my chin, beginning to work the fat into the mixture with my fingers. Roger was still a trifle pale and tight around the mouth, but he gave me a wry smile as he sat.

â€œFine.â€

â€œYou didnâ€™t have to do it, you know.â€

â€œYes, I did.â€ The note of wryness in his voice deepened. â€œI only wish Iâ€™d done it better.â€

I shrugged, one-shouldered, and reached into the basin he held out for me.

â€œIt takes practice.â€

Roger had volunteered to kill the pig. Jamie had simply handed him the maul and stood back. I had seen Jamie kill pigs before; he said a brief prayer, blessed the pig, then crushed the skull with one tremendous blow. It had taken Roger five tries, and the memory of the squealing raised gooseflesh on my shoulders even now. Afterward, he had set down the maul, gone behind a tree, and been violently sick.

I scooped another handful. The mix was thickening, developing a greasy feel.

â€œHe should have shown you how.â€

â€œI shouldnâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything technically difficult about it,â€ Roger said dryly. â€œStraightforward enough, after all, to bash an animal on the head.â€

â€œPhysically, perhaps,â€ I agreed. I scooped more fat, working with both hands now. â€œThereâ€™s a prayer for it, you know. For slaughtering an animal, I mean. Jamie should have told you.â€

He looked faintly startled.

â€œNo, I didnâ€™t know.â€ He smiled, a little better now. â€œLast rites for the pig, aye?â€

â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s for the pigâ€™s benefit,â€ I said tartly. We lapsed into silence for a few moments, as I creamed the rest of the fat into the grain mixture, pausing to flick away occasional bits of gristle. I could feel Rogerâ€™s eyes on the barrel, watching the curious alchemy of cookery, that process of making the transfer of life from one being to another palatable.

â€œHighland drovers sometimes drain a cup or two of blood from one of their beasts, and mix it with oatmeal to eat on the road,â€ I said. â€œNutritious, I suppose, but less tasty.â€

Roger nodded, abstracted. He had set down the nearly empty basin and was cleaning dried blood from under his nails with the point of his dirk.

â€œIs it the same as the one for deer?â€ he asked. â€œThe prayer. Iâ€™ve seen Jamie say that one, though I didnâ€™t catch all of the words.â€

â€œThe gralloch prayer? I donâ€™t know. Why donâ€™t you ask him?â€

Roger worked industriously on a thumbnail, eyes fixed on his hand.

â€œI wasnâ€™t sure if he thought it right for me to know it. Me not being a Catholic, I mean.â€

I looked down into the mixture, hiding a smile.

â€œI donâ€™t think it would make a difference. That particular prayer is a lot older than the Church of Rome, if Iâ€™m not mistaken.â€

A flicker of interest lit Rogerâ€™s face, the buried scholar coming to the surface.

â€œI did think the Gaelic was a very old formâ€”even older than what you hear these daysâ€”I mean . . . now.â€ He flushed a little, realizing what he had said. I nodded, but didnâ€™t say anything.

I remembered what it was like, that feeling that one was living in an elaborate make-believe. The feeling that reality existed in another time, another place. I remembered, and with a small shock, realized that it was now only memoryâ€”for me, time had shifted, as though my illness had pushed me through some final barrier.

Now was my time, reality the scrape of wood and slick of grease beneath my fingers, the arc of the sun that set the rhythm of my days, the nearness of Jamie. It was the other world, of cars and ringing telephones, of alarm clocks and mortgages, that seemed unreal and remote, the stuff of dreams.

Neither Roger nor Bree had made that transition, though. I could see it in the way they behaved, hear it in the echoes of their private conversations. Likely it was because they had each other; they could keep the other time alive, a small shared world between them. For me, the change was easier. I had lived here before, had come this time on purpose, after allâ€”and I had Jamie. No matter what I told him of the future, he could never see it as other than a fairy tale. Our small shared world was built of different things.

I worried now and then about Bree and Roger, though. It was dangerous to treat the past as they sometimes didâ€”as picturesque or curious, a temporary condition that could be escaped. There was no escape for themâ€”whether it was love or duty, Jemmy held them both, a small redheaded anchor to the present. Betterâ€”or safer, at leastâ€”if they could wholly accept this time as theirs.

â€œThe Indians have it, too,â€ I said to Roger. â€œThe gralloch prayer, or something like it. Thatâ€™s why I said I thought it older than the Church.â€

He nodded, interested.

â€œI think that kind of thing is common to all primitive culturesâ€”anyplace where men kill to eat.â€

Primitive cultures. I caught my lower lip between my teeth, forbearing to point out that primitive or not, if his family were to survive, he personally would very likely be obliged to kill for them. But then I caught sight of his hand, idly rubbing at the dried blood between his fingers. He knew that already. â€œYes, I did,â€ heâ€™d said, when Iâ€™d told him he need not.

He looked up then, caught my eye, and gave me a faint, tired smile. He understood.

â€œI think maybe . . . itâ€™s that killing without ceremony seems like murder,â€ he said slowly. â€œIf you have the ceremonyâ€”some sort of ritual that acknowledges your necessity . . .â€

â€œNecessityâ€”and also sacrifice.â€ Jamieâ€™s voice came softly from behind me, startling me. I turned my head sharply. He was standing in the shadow of the big red spruce; I wondered how long heâ€™d been there.

â€œDidnâ€™t hear you come out,â€ I said, turning up my face to be kissed as he came to me. â€œHas the Major gone?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, and kissed my brow, one of the few clean spots left. â€œIâ€™ve left him wiâ€™ Sinclair for a bit. Heâ€™s exercised about the Committee of Safety, aye?â€ He grimaced, then turned to Roger.

â€œAye, yeâ€™ve the right of it,â€ he said. â€œKillingâ€™s never a pleasant business, but itâ€™s needful. If ye must spill blood, though, itâ€™s right to take it wiâ€™ thanks.â€

Roger nodded, glancing at the mixture I was working, up to my elbows in spilled blood.

â€œYeâ€™ll tell me the proper words for the next time, then?â€

â€œNot too late for this time, is it?â€ I said. Both men looked slightly startled. I raised an eyebrow at Jamie, then Roger. â€œI did say it wasnâ€™t for the pig.â€

Jamieâ€™s eyes met mine with a glint of humor, but he nodded gravely.

â€œWell enough.â€

At my direction, he took up the heavy jar of spices: the ground mixture of mace and marjoram, sage and pepper, parsley and thyme. Roger held out his hands, cupped, and Jamie poured them full. Then Roger rubbed the herbs slowly between his palms, showering the dusty, greenish crumbs into the barrel, their pungent scent mingling with the smell of the blood, as Jamie spoke the words slowly, in an ancient tongue come down from the days of the Norsemen.

â€œSay it in English,â€ I said, seeing from Rogerâ€™s face that while he spoke the words, he did not recognize them all.

â€œO Lord, bless the blood and the flesh of this the creature that You gave me,â€ Jamie said softly. He scooped a pinch of the herbs himself, and rubbed them between thumb and forefinger, in a rain of fragrant dust.

â€œCreated by Your hand as You created man,

Life given for life.

That me and mine may eat with thanks for the gift,

That me and mine may give thanks for Your own sacrifice of blood and flesh,

Life given for life.â€

The last crumbs of green and gray disappeared into the mixture under my hands, and the ritual of the sausage was complete.



â€œTHAT WAS GOOD OF YE, Sassenach,â€ Jamie said, drying my clean, wet hands and arms with the towel afterward. He nodded toward the corner of the house, where Roger had disappeared to help with the rest of the butchering, looking somewhat more peaceful. â€œI did think to tell him before, but I couldna see how to do it.â€

I smiled and moved close to him. It was a cold, windy day, and now that I had stopped working, the chill drove me closer to seek his warmth. He wrapped his arms around me, and I felt both the reassuring heat of his embrace, and the soft crackle of paper inside his shirt.

â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€

â€œOh, a bittie letter Sinclairâ€™s brought,â€ he said, drawing back a bit to reach into his shirt. â€œI didna want to open it while Donald was there, and didna trust him not to be reading it when I went out.â€

â€œItâ€™s not your letter, anyway,â€ I said, taking the smudged wad of paper from him. â€œItâ€™s mine.â€

â€œOh, is it? Sinclair didna say, just handed it to me.â€

â€œHe would!â€ Not unusually, Ronnie Sinclair viewed meâ€”all women, for that matterâ€”as simply a minor appendage of a husband. I rather pitied the woman he might eventually induce to marry him.

I unfolded the note with some difficulty; it had been worn so long next to sweaty skin that the edges had frayed and stuck together.

The message inside was brief and cryptic, but unsettling. It had been scratched into the paper with something like a sharpened stick, using an ink that looked disturbingly like dried blood, though it was more likely berry juice.

â€œWhat does it say, Sassenach?â€ Seeing me frowning at the paper, Jamie moved to the side to look. I held it out to him.

Far down, in one corner, scratched in faint and tiny letters, as though the sender had hoped by this means to escape notice, was the word â€œFaydree.â€ Above, in bolder scratchings, the message read

YU

CUM



â€œIT MUST BE HER,â€ I said, shivering as I drew my shawl closer. It was cold in the surgery, despite the small brazier glowing in the corner, but Ronnie Sinclair and MacDonald were in the kitchen, drinking cider and waiting while the sausages boiled. I spread the note open on my surgery table, its minatory summons dark and peremptory above the timid signature. â€œLook. Who else could it be?â€

â€œShe canna write, surely?â€ Jamie objected. â€œThough I suppose it might be that someone wrote it for her,â€ he amended, frowning.

â€œNo, she could have written this, I think.â€ Brianna and Roger had come into the surgery, too; Bree reached out and touched the ragged paper, one long finger gently tracing the staggered letters. â€œI taught her.â€

â€œYou did?â€ Jamie looked surprised. â€œWhen?â€

â€œWhen I stayed at River Run. When you and Mama went to find Roger.â€ Her wide mouth pressed thin for a moment; it wasnâ€™t an occasion she wished much to remember.

â€œI taught her the alphabet; I meant to teach her to read and write. We did all the lettersâ€”she knew how they sounded, and she could draw them. But then one day she said she couldnâ€™t anymore, and she wouldnâ€™t sit down with me.â€ She glanced up, a troubled frown between her thick, red brows. â€œI thought maybe Aunt Jocasta found out, and stopped her.â€

â€œMore likely Ulysses. Jocasta would have stopped you, lass.â€ Jamieâ€™s frown matched hers as he glanced at me. â€œYe do think itâ€™s Phaedre, then? My auntâ€™s body slave?â€

I shook my head, and bit one corner of my lip in doubt.

â€œThe slaves at River Run do say her name like thatâ€”Faydree. And I certainly donâ€™t know anyone else by that name.â€

Jamie had questioned Ronnie Sinclairâ€”casually, to give no occasion for alarm or gossipâ€”but the cooper knew no more than he had told me: the note had been handed to him by a tinker, with the simple direction that it was â€œfor the healer.â€

I leaned over the table, lifting a candle high to look at the note once more. The â€œFâ€ of the signature had been made with a hesitant, repeated strokeâ€”more than one try before the writer had committed herself to signing it. The more evidence, I thought, of its origin. I didnâ€™t know whether it was against the law in North Carolina to teach a slave to read or write, but it was certainly discouraged. While there were marked exceptionsâ€”slaves educated to their ownersâ€™ ends, like Ulysses himselfâ€”it was on the whole a dangerous skill, and one a slave would go some way to conceal.

â€œShe wouldnâ€™t have risked sending word like this, unless it was a serious matter,â€ Roger said. He stood behind Bree, one hand on her shoulder, looking down at the note she held flattened on the table. â€œBut what?â€

â€œHave you heard from your aunt lately?â€ I asked Jamie, but I knew the answer before he shook his head. Any word from River Run that reached the Ridge would have been a matter of public knowledge within hours.

We had not gone to the Gathering at Mt. Helicon this year; there was too much to do on the Ridge and Jamie wished to avoid the heated politics involved. Still, Jocasta and Duncan had meant to be there. Anything wrong would surely have been a matter of general gossip, which would have reached us long since.

â€œSo it is not only serious, but a private matter to the slave, too,â€ Jamie said. â€œOtherwise, my aunt would have written, or Duncan sent word.â€ His two stiff fingers tapped once, softly, against his thigh.

We stood around the table, staring at the note as though it were a small white slab of dynamite. The scent of boiling sausages filled the cold air, warm and comforting.

â€œWhy you?â€ Roger asked, looking up at me. â€œDo you think it might be a medical matter? If she were ill, sayâ€”or pregnant?â€

â€œNot illness,â€ I said. â€œToo urgent.â€ It was a weekâ€™s ride to River Run at leastâ€”in good weather, and barring accident. Heaven knew how long it had taken the note to make its way up to Fraserâ€™s Ridge.

â€œBut if she was pregnant? Maybe.â€ Brianna pursed her lips, still frowning at the paper. â€œI think she thinks of Mama as a friend. Sheâ€™d tell you before sheâ€™d tell Aunt Jocasta, I think.â€

I nodded, but reluctantly. Friendship was too strong a word; people situated as Phaedre and I could not be friends. Liking was constrained by too many thingsâ€”suspicion, mistrust, the vast chasm of difference that slavery imposed.

And yet there was a certain feeling of sympathy between us, that much was true. I had worked with her, side by side, planting herbs and harvesting them, making simples for the stillroom, explaining their uses. We had buried a dead girl together and plotted to protect a runaway slave accused of her murder. She had a certain talent with the sick, did Phaedre, and some knowledge of herbs. Any minor matter, she could deal with herself. But something like an unexpected pregnancy . . .

â€œWhat does she think I could do, though, I wonder?â€ I was thinking out loud, and my fingertips felt cold in contemplation. An unexpected child born to a slave would be of no concern to an ownerâ€”to the contrary, it would be welcomed as additional property; but I had heard stories of slave women who killed a child at birth, rather than have the babe brought up in slavery. Phaedre was a house slave, though, well-treated, and Jocasta did not separate slave families, I knew that. If it were that, Phaedreâ€™s situation was surely not so direâ€”and yet, who was I to judge?

I blew out a cloud of smoky breath, uncertain.

â€œI just canâ€™t see whyâ€”I mean, she couldnâ€™t possibly expect that Iâ€™d help her to get rid of a child. And for anything else . . . why me? There are midwives and healers much closer. It just doesnâ€™t make sense.â€

â€œWhat ifâ€”â€ Brianna said, and stopped. She pursed her lips in speculation, looking from me to Jamie and back. â€œWhat if,â€ she said carefully, â€œshe was pregnant, but the father was . . . someone it shouldnâ€™t be?â€

A wary but humorous speculation sprang up in Jamieâ€™s eyes, increasing the resemblance between him and Brianna.

â€œWho, lass?â€ he said. â€œFarquard Campbell?â€

I laughed out loud at the thought, and Brianna snorted with mirth, white wisps of breath floating round her head. The notion of the very uprightâ€”and quite elderlyâ€”Farquard Campbell seducing a house slave was . . .

â€œWell, no,â€ Brianna said. â€œThough he does have all those children. But I just thought suddenlyâ€”what if it was Duncan?â€

Jamie cleared his throat, and avoided catching my eye. I bit my lip, feeling my face start to go red. Duncan had confessed his chronic impotence to Jamie before Duncanâ€™s wedding to Jocastaâ€”but Brianna didnâ€™t know.

â€œOh, I shouldna think it likely,â€ Jamie said, sounding a trifle choked. He coughed, and fanned smoke from the brazier away from his face. â€œWhat gives ye that notion, lass?â€

â€œNothing about Duncan,â€ she assured him. â€œBut Aunt Jocasta isâ€”well, old. And you know what men can be like.â€

â€œNo, what?â€ asked Roger blandly, making me cough with the effort to suppress a laugh.

Jamie eyed her with a certain amount of cynicism.

â€œA good deal better than you do, a nighean. And while I wouldna wager much on some men, I think I should feel safe in laying odds that Duncan Innes isna the man to be breaking his marriage vows with his wifeâ€™s black slave.â€

I made a small noise, and Roger lifted one eyebrow at me.

â€œAre you all right?â€

â€œFine,â€ I said, sounding strangled. â€œJustâ€”fine.â€ I put a corner of the shawl over my no-doubt purple face and coughed ostentatiously. â€œItâ€™s . . . smoky in here, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œMaybe so,â€ Brianna conceded, addressing Jamie. â€œIt might not be that at all. Itâ€™s just that Phaedre sent the note to â€˜the healer,â€™ probably because she didnâ€™t want to use Mamaâ€™s name, in case anybody saw the note before it got here. I just thought, maybe it wasnâ€™t really Mama she wantsâ€”maybe itâ€™s you.â€

That sobered both Jamie and me, and we glanced at each other. It was a definite possibility, and one that hadnâ€™t occurred to either of us.

â€œShe couldnâ€™t send a note direct to you without rousing all kinds of curiosity,â€ Bree went on, frowning at the note. â€œBut she could say â€˜the healerâ€™ without putting a name on it. And sheâ€™d know that if Mama came, youâ€™d probably come with her, at this time of year. Or if you didnâ€™t, Mama could send for you openly.â€

â€œItâ€™s a thought,â€ Jamie said slowly. â€œBut why in Godâ€™s name might she want me?â€

â€œOnly one way to find out,â€ said Roger, practical. He looked at Jamie. â€œMost of the outside work is done; the crops and the hay are in, the slaughteringâ€™s finished. We can manage here, if you want to go.â€

Jamie stood still for a moment, frowning in thought, then crossed to the window and raised the sash. A cold wind blew into the room, and Bree pinned the fluttering note to the table to keep it from taking wing. The coals in the small brazier smoked and flamed higher, and the bunches of dried herbs rustled uneasily overhead.

Jamie thrust his head out the window and breathed in deeply, eyes closed like one savoring the bouquet of fine wine.

â€œCold and clear,â€ he announced, drawing in his head and closing the window. â€œClear weather for three days, at least. We could be off the mountain by that time, and we ride briskly.â€ He smiled at me; the tip of his nose was red with the cold. â€œIn the meantime, dâ€™ye think those sausages are ready yet?â€

BETRAYALS




A SLAVE I DIDNâ€™T RECOGNIZE opened the door to us, a broad-built woman in a yellow turban. She eyed us severely, but Jamie gave her no chance to speak, pushing rudely past her into the hall.

â€œHeâ€™s Mrs. Cameronâ€™s nephew,â€ I felt obliged to explain to her, as I followed him.

â€œI can see that,â€ she muttered, in a lilt that came from Barbados. She glared after him, making it evident that she detected a family resemblance in terms of high-handedness, as well as physique.

â€œIâ€™m his wife,â€ I added, overcoming the reflexive urge to shake her hand, and bowing slightly instead. â€œClaire Fraser. Nice to meet you.â€

She blinked, disconcerted, but before she could reply, I had whisked past her, following Jamie toward the small drawing room where Jocasta was inclined to sit in the afternoons.

The door to the drawing room was closed, and as Jamie set his hand on the knob, a sharp yelp came from insideâ€”the prelude to a barrage of frenzied barking as the door swung wide.

Stopped in his tracks, Jamie paused, hand on the door, frowning at the small brown bundle of fur that leaped to and fro at his feet, eyes bulging in hysteria as it barked its head off.

â€œWhat is that?â€ he said, edging his way into the room as the creature made abortive dashes at his boots, still yapping.

â€œItâ€™s a wee dog, what dâ€™ye think?â€ Jocasta said acerbically. She lifted herself from her chair, frowning in the direction of the noise. â€œSheas, Samson.â€

â€œSamson? Oh, to be sure. The hair.â€ Smiling despite himself, Jamie squatted and extended a closed fist toward the dog. Throttling back to a low growl, the dog extended a suspicious nose toward his knuckles.

â€œWhereâ€™s Delilah?â€ I asked, edging into the room behind him.

â€œAh, yeâ€™ve come, as well, Claire?â€ Jocastaâ€™s face swiveled in my direction, lit by a smile. â€œA rare treat, to have the both of ye. I dinna suppose Brianna or the bittie lad have come alongâ€”no, I would have heard them.â€ Dismissing that, she sat down again, and waved toward the hearth.

â€œAs for Delilah, the lazy creatureâ€™s asleep by the fire; I can hear her snoring.â€

Delilah was a large whitish hound of indeterminate breed but plentiful skin; it drooped around her in folds of relaxation as she lay on her back, paws curled over a freckled belly. Hearing her name, she snorted briefly, opened one eye a crack, then closed it again.

â€œI see yeâ€™ve had a few changes since I was last here,â€ Jamie observed, rising to his feet. â€œWhere is Duncan? And Ulysses?â€

â€œGone. Looking for Phaedre.â€ Jocasta had lost weight; the high MacKenzie cheekbones stood out sharp, and her skin looked thin and creased.

â€œLooking for her?â€ Jamie glanced sharply at her. â€œWhatâ€™s become of the lass?â€

â€œRun away.â€ She spoke with her usual self-possession, but her voice was bleak.

â€œRun away? Butâ€”are you sure?â€ Her workbox had been upset, the contents spilled on the floor. I knelt and began to tidy the confusion, picking up the scattered reels of thread.

â€œWeel, sheâ€™s gone,â€ Jocasta said with some acerbity. â€œEither sheâ€™s run, or someoneâ€™s stolen her. And I canna think who would have the gall or the skill to snatch her from my house, and no one seeing.â€

I exchanged a quick glance with Jamie, who shook his head, frowning. Jocasta was rubbing a fold of her skirt between thumb and forefinger; I could see small worn spots in the nap of the fabric near her hand, where she had done it repeatedly. Jamie saw it, too.

â€œWhen did she go, Auntie?â€ he asked quietly.

â€œFour weeks past. Duncan and Ulysses have been gone for two.â€

That fitted well enough with the arrival of the note. No telling how long before her disappearance the note had actually been written, given the vagaries of delivery.

â€œI see Duncan took pains to leave ye some company,â€ Jamie observed. Samson had abandoned his watchdog role, and was sniffing assiduously at Jamieâ€™s boots. Delilah rolled onto her side with a luxurious groan and opened two luminous brown eyes, through which she regarded me with utmost tranquillity.

â€œOh, aye, theyâ€™re that.â€ Half-grudgingly, Jocasta leaned out from her chair and located the houndâ€™s head, scratching behind the long, floppy ears. â€œThough Duncan meant them for my protection, or so he said.â€

â€œA sensible precaution,â€ Jamie said mildly. It was; we had had no further word of Stephen Bonnet, nor had Jocasta heard the voice of the masked man again. But lacking the concrete reassurance of a corpse, either one could presumably pop up at any time.

â€œWhy would the lassie run, Aunt?â€ Jamie asked. His tone was still mild, but persistent.

Jocasta shook her head, lips compressed.

â€œI dinna ken at all, Nephew.â€

â€œNothingâ€™s happened of late? Nothing out of the ordinary?â€ he pressed.

â€œDo ye not think I should have said at once?â€ she asked sharply. â€œNo. I woke late one morning, and couldna hear her about my room. There was nay tea by my bed, and the fire had gone out; I could smell the ashes. I called for her, and there was no answer. Gone, she wasâ€”vanished without a trace.â€ She tilted her head toward him with a grim sort of â€œso thereâ€ expression.

I raised a brow at Jamie and touched the pocket I wore at my waist, containing the note. Ought we to tell her?

He nodded, and I drew the note from my pocket, unfolding it on the arm of her chair, as he explained.

Jocastaâ€™s look of displeasure faded into one of puzzled astonishment.

â€œWhyever should she send for you, a nighean?â€ she asked, turning to me.

â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€”perhaps she was with child?â€ I suggested. â€œOr had contracted aâ€”disease of some sort?â€ I didnâ€™t want to suggest syphilis openly, but it was a possibility. If Manfred had infected Mrs. Sylvie, and she had then passed the infection on to one or more of her customers in Cross Creek, who then had visited River Run . . . but that would mean, perhaps, that Phaedre had had some kind of relationship with a white man. That was something a slave woman would go to great lengths to keep secret.

Jocasta, no fool, was rapidly coming to similar conclusions, though her thoughts ran parallel to mine.

â€œA child, that would be no great matter,â€ she said, flicking a hand. â€œBut if she had a lover . . . aye,â€ she said thoughtfully. â€œShe might have gone off with a lover. But then, why send for you?â€

Jamie was growing restive, impatient with so much unprovable speculation.

â€œPerhaps she might think ye meant to sell her, Aunt, if ye discovered such a thing?â€

â€œTo sell her?â€

Jocasta broke out laughing. Not her usual social laughter, nor even the sound of genuine amusement; this was shockingâ€”loud and crude, almost vicious in its hilarity. It was her brother Dougalâ€™s laugh, and the blood ran momentarily cold in my veins.

I glanced at Jamie, to find him looking down at her, face gone blank. Not in puzzlement; it was the mask he wore to hide strong feeling. So heâ€™d heard that grisly echo, too.

She seemed unable to stop. Her hands clutched the carved arms of her chair and she leaned forward, face turning red, gasping for breath between those unnerving deep guffaws.

Delilah rolled onto her belly and uttered a low â€œwuffâ€ of unease, looking anxiously round, unsure what the matter was, but convinced that something wasnâ€™t right. Samson had backed under the settee, growling.

Jamie reached out and took her by the shoulderâ€”not gently.

â€œBe still, Aunt,â€ he said. â€œYeâ€™re frightening your wee dogs.â€

She stopped, abruptly. There was no sound but the faint wheeze of her breathing, nearly as unnerving as the laughter. She sat still, bolt upright in her chair, hands on the arms, the blood ebbing slowly from her face and her eyes gone dark and bright, fixed as though on something that only she could see.

â€œSell her,â€ she murmured, and her mouth creased as though the laughter were about to break out of her again. She didnâ€™t laugh, though, but stood up suddenly. Samson yapped once, in astonishment.

â€œCome with me.â€

She was through the door before either of us could say anything. Jamie lifted an eyebrow at me, but motioned me through the door before him.

She knew the house intimately; she made her way down the hall toward the door to the stables with no more than an occasional touch of the wall to keep her bearings, walking as fast as though she could see. Outside, though, she paused, feeling with one extended foot for the edge of the brick-laid path.

Jamie stepped up beside her and took her firmly by the elbow.

â€œWhere dâ€™ye wish to go?â€ he asked, a certain resignation in his tone.

â€œTo the carriage barn.â€ The peculiar laughter had left her, but her face was still flushed, her strong chin lifted with an air of defiance. Who was she defying? I wondered.

The carriage barn was shadowed and tranquil, dust motes drifting gold in the stir of air from the opened doors. A wagon, a carriage, a sledge, and the elegant two-wheeled trap sat like large, placid beasts on the straw-covered floor. I glanced at Jamie, whose mouth curled slightly as he looked at me; we had taken temporary refuge in that carriage, during the chaos of Jocastaâ€™s wedding to Duncan, almost four years before.

Jocasta paused in the doorway, one hand braced on the jamb and breathing deeply, as though orienting herself. She made no move to enter the barn herself, though, but instead nodded toward the depths of the building.

â€œAlong the back wall, an mhic mo peather. There are boxes there; I want the large chest made of wickerwork, the one as high as your knee, with a rope tied round it.â€

I had not really noticed during our earlier excursion into the carriage barn, but the back wall was stacked high with boxes, crates, and bundles, piled two and three deep. With such explicit direction, though, Jamie made short work of finding the desired container, and dragged it out into the light, covered with dust and bits of straw.

â€œShall I carry it into the house for ye, Auntie?â€ he asked, rubbing a finger under a twitching nose.

She shook her head, stooping and feeling for the knot of the rope that bound it.

â€œNo. I shallna have it the house. I swore I should not.â€

â€œLet me.â€ I laid a hand on hers to still her fumbling, then took charge of the knot myself. Whoever had tied it had been thorough, but not skilled; I had it loose within a minute, and the catch undone.

The wicker chest was filled with pictures. Bundles of loose drawings, done in pencil, ink, and charcoal, neatly tied with faded ribbons of colored silk. Several bound sketchbooks. And a number of paintings: a few large unframed squares, and two smaller boxes of miniatures, all framed, stacked on edge like a deck of cards.

I heard Jocasta sigh, above me, and looked up. She stood still, eyes closed, and I could tell that she was inhaling deeply, breathing in the smell of the picturesâ€”the smell of oils and charcoal, gesso, paper, canvas, linseed and turpentine, a full-bodied ghost that floated out of its wicker casket, transparently vivid against the background scents of straw and dust, wood and wicker.

Her fingers curled, thumb rubbing against the tips of her other fingers, unconsciously rolling a brush between them. I had seen Bree do that, now and then, looking at something she wanted to paint. Jocasta sighed again, then opened her eyes and knelt down beside me, reaching in to run her fingers lightly over the cache of buried art, searching.

â€œThe oils,â€ she said. â€œFetch those out.â€

I had already taken out the boxes of miniatures. Jamie squatted on the other side of the casket, lifting the bundles of loose drawings and the sketchbooks, so that I could pull out the larger oils, laid on edge along the side of the container.

â€œA portrait,â€ she said, head on one side to listen to the flat, hollow sound as I laid each one against the side of the wicker box. â€œAn old man.â€

It was plain which one she meant. Two of the large canvases were landscapes, three, portraits. I recognized Farquard Campbell, much younger than his present age, and what must be a self-portrait of Jocasta herself, done perhaps twenty years before. I had no time to look at these, though, interesting as they were.

The third portrait looked to have been done much more recently than the others, and showed the effects of Jocastaâ€™s failing eyesight.

The edges were blurred, the colors muddy, shapes just slightly distorted, so that the elderly gentleman who looked out of the clouded oil seemed somehow disturbing, as though he belonged to some race not quite human, in spite of the orthodoxy of his wig and high white stock.

He wore a black coat and waistcoat, old-fashioned in style, with the folds of a tartan plaid draped over his shoulder, caught up with a brooch whose golden gleam was echoed by the ornamental knurl atop the dirk the old man held, his fingers bent and gnarled with arthritis. I recognized that dirk.

â€œSo that is Hector Cameron.â€ Jamie recognized it, too. He looked at the painting with fascination.

Jocasta reached out a hand, touching the surface of the paint as though to identify it by touch.

â€œAye, thatâ€™s him,â€ she said dryly. â€œNever saw him in life, did ye, Nephew?â€

Jamie shook his head.

â€œOnce perhapsâ€”but I was nay more than a babe at the time.â€ His gaze traced the old manâ€™s features with deep interest, as though looking for clues to Hector Cameronâ€™s character. Such clues were evident; the manâ€™s force of personality fairly vibrated from the canvas.

He had strong bones, the man in the portrait, though the flesh hung from them in the infirmity of age. The eyes were still sharp, but one was half-closedâ€”it might have been only a drooping eyelid caused by a small stroke, but the impression was that of an habitual manner of looking at the world; one eye always narrowed in cynical appraisal.

Jocasta was searching through the contents of the chest, fingers darting lightly here and there, like hunting moths. She touched one box of miniatures, and lifted it with a small grunt of satisfaction.

She ran a finger slowly along the edge of each miniature, and I saw that the frames were patterned differently; squares and ovals, smooth gilded wood, tarnished silver laid in a rope border, another studded with tiny rosettes. She found one she recognized, and plucked it from the box, handing it absently to me as she went back to her search.

The miniature was also of Hector Cameronâ€”but this portrait done many years before the other. Dark wavy hair lay loose on his shoulders, a small ornamental braid down one side sporting two grouseâ€™s feathers, in the ancient Highland style. The same solid bones were there, but the flesh was firm; he had been handsome, Hector Cameron.

It was an habitual expression; whether by inclination or accident of birth, the right eye was narrowed here, as well, though not as much as in the older portrait.

My scrutiny was interrupted by Jocasta, who laid a hand on my arm.

â€œIs this the lass?â€ she asked, thrusting another of the miniatures at me.

I took it, puzzled, and gasped when I turned it over. It was Phaedre, done when the girl was in her early teens. Her usual cap was missing; she wore a simple kerchief bound over her hair that threw the bones of her face into bold relief. Hector Cameronâ€™s bones.

Jocasta nudged the box of paintings with her foot.

â€œGive those to your daughter, Nephew. Tell her to paint them overâ€”it would be shame to waste the canvas.â€ Without waiting for response, she set off back toward the house alone, hesitating only briefly at the fork in the path, steering by scent and memory.



THERE WAS A PROFOUND silence in the wake of Jocastaâ€™s departure, broken only by the singing of a mockingbird in a nearby pine.

â€œI will be damned,â€ Jamie said at last, taking his eyes off the figure of his aunt as she vanished into the house, alone. He didnâ€™t look shocked, so much as deeply bemused. â€œDid the girl know, dâ€™ye think?â€

â€œAlmost certainly,â€ I said. â€œThe slaves would surely have known; some must have been here when she was born; theyâ€™d have told her, if she wasnâ€™t quick enough to have worked it out herselfâ€”and I certainly think she is.â€

He nodded, and leaned back against the wall of the carriage house, looking meditatively down his long nose at the wicker chest of paintings. I felt a strong reluctance to go back to the house, myself. The buildings were beautiful, a mellow gold in the late-fall sun, and the grounds were peaceful, well-ordered. The sound of cheerful voices came from the kitchen garden, several horses grazed contentedly in the paddock nearby, and far away down the distant silver river, a small boat came down, a four-oared piretta, its oars stroking the surface, brisk and graceful as a water strider.

â€œWhere every prospect pleases, and only man is vile,â€ I remarked. Jamie gave me a brief glance of incomprehension, then returned to his thoughts.

So Jocasta would by no means sell Phaedre, and thought Phaedre knew it. I wondered exactly why. Because she felt some duty to the girl, as the child of her husband? Or as a subtle form of revenge on that long-dead husband, keeping his illegitimate daughter as a slave, a body servant? I supposed that the two were not entirely exclusive, come to thatâ€”I had known Jocasta long enough to realize that her motives were rarely simple.

There was a chill in the air, with the sun low in the sky. I leaned against the carriage house beside Jamie, feeling the stored warmth of the sun soak from its bricks into my body, and wished that we could step into the old farm wagon and drive posthaste back to the Ridge, leaving River Run to deal with its own legacies of bitterness.

But the note was in my pocket, crackling when I moved. YU CUM. Not an appeal I could dismiss. But I had comeâ€”and now what?

Jamie straightened suddenly, looking toward the river. I looked, too, and saw that the boat had drawn into the dock there. A tall figure sprang up onto the dock, then turned to help another out of the boat. The second man was shorter, and moved in an odd fashion, off-kilter and out of rhythm.

â€œDuncan,â€ I said at once, seeing this. â€œAnd Ulysses. Theyâ€™re back!â€

â€œAye,â€ Jamie said, taking my arm and starting toward the house. â€œBut they havena found her.â€



RUNAWAY or STOLEN on the 31st of October, a Negro Wench, twenty-two years of Age, above middling Height and comely in Appearance, with a Scar on the left Forearm in the shape of an Oval, caused by a Burn. Dressed in an indigo Gown, with a green-striped Apron, white Cap, brown Stockings, and leather Shoes. No missing Teeth. Known by the Name of â€œFAYDREE.â€ Communicate Particulars to D. Innes, River Run Plantation, in the vicinity of Cross Creek. Substantial Reward will be paid for good Information.

I smoothed the crumpled broadsheet, which also sported a crude drawing of Phaedre, looking vaguely cross-eyed. Duncan had emptied his pockets and dropped a handful of these sheets on the table in the hall when he had come in the afternoon before, exhausted and dispirited. They had, he said, posted the bills in every tavern and public house between Campbelton and Wilmington, making inquiries as they wentâ€”but to no avail. Phaedre had vanished like the dew.

â€œMay I have the marmalade, please?â€ Jamie and I were taking breakfast alone, neither Jocasta nor Duncan having appeared this morning. I was enjoying it, despite the gloomy atmosphere. Breakfast at River Run was normally a lavish affair, extending even to a pot of real teaâ€”Jocasta must be paying her pet smuggler an absolute fortune for it; there was none to be found between Virginia and Georgia, to the best of my knowledge.

Jamie was frowning at another of the broadsheets, deep in thought. He didnâ€™t take his eyes off it, but his hand roamed vaguely over the table, settled on the cream jug, and passed it across to me.

Ulysses, showing little sign of his long journey beyond a certain heaviness of the eyes, stepped silently forward, took the cream jug, replaced it neatly, and set the pot of marmalade beside my plate.

â€œThank you,â€ I said, and he graciously inclined his head.

â€œWill you require further bloaters, madam?â€ he inquired. â€œOr more ham?â€

I shook my head, my mouth being full of toast, and he glided off, picking up a loaded tray by the door, this presumably intended for Jocasta, Duncan, or both.

Jamie watched him go, with a sort of abstracted expression.

â€œI have been thinking, Sassenach,â€ he said.

â€œI would never have guessed it,â€ I assured him. â€œAbout what?â€

He looked momentarily surprised, but then smiled, realizing.

â€œYe kent what I told ye, Sassenach, about Brianna and the widow McCallum? That she wouldna scruple long to act, if Roger Mac were to be taking heed where he shouldnâ€™t?â€

â€œI do,â€ I said.

He nodded, as though verifying something to himself.

â€œWell, the lass comes by it honestly enough. The MacKenzies of Leoch are proud as Lucifer, all of them, and black jealous with it. Ye dinna want to cross oneâ€”still less to betray one.â€

I regarded him warily over my cup of tea, wondering where this was leading.

â€œI thought their defining trait was charm, allied with cunning. And as for betrayal, both your uncles were past hands at it.â€

â€œThe two go together, do they not?â€ he asked, reaching across to dip a spoon in the marmalade. â€œYe must beguile someone before ye can betray them, no? And I am inclined to think that a man who would betray is all the quicker to resent betrayal himself. Or a woman,â€ he added delicately.

â€œOh, really,â€ I said, sipping with pleasure. â€œJocasta, you mean.â€ Put in those terms, I could see it. The MacKenzies of Leoch had powerful personalitiesâ€”I did wonder what Jamieâ€™s maternal grandfather, the notorious Red Jacob, had been likeâ€”and Iâ€™d noted small commonalities of behavior between Jocasta and her elder brothers before.

Colum and Dougal had had an unshakable loyalty to each otherâ€”but to no one else. And Jocasta was essentially alone, separated from her family since her first marriage at fifteen. Being a woman, it was natural that the charm should be more apparent in herâ€”but that didnâ€™t mean the cunning wasnâ€™t there. Nor yet the jealousy, I supposed.

â€œWell, plainly she knew that Hector betrayed herâ€”and I do wonder whether she painted that portrait of Phaedre as a means of indicating to the world at large that she knew it, or merely as a private message to Hectorâ€”but what has that got to do with the present situation?â€

He shook his head.

â€œNot Hector,â€ he said. â€œDuncan.â€

I stared at him, absolutely open-mouthed. All other considerations aside, Duncan was impotent; he had told Jamie so, on the eve of his wedding to Jocasta. Jamie smiled crookedly, and reaching across the table, put a thumb under my chin and pushed my mouth gently shut.

â€œItâ€™s a thought, Sassenach, is all Iâ€™m saying. But I think I must go and have a word wiâ€™ the man. Will ye come?â€



DUNCAN WAS IN the small room he used as a private office, tucked away above the stables, along with the tiny rooms that housed the grooms and stable-lads. He was slumped in a chair, looking hopelessly at the untidy stacks of papers and undusted ledgers that had accumulated on every horizontal surface.

He looked desperately tired, and a great deal older than when I had last seen him, at Flora MacDonaldâ€™s barbecue. His gray hair was thinning, and when he turned to greet us, the light of the sun shone across his face, and I saw the thin line of the harelip scar Roger had mentioned, hidden in the luxuriant growth of his mustache.

Something vital seemed to have gone out of him, and when Jamie delicately broached the subject upon which we had come, he made no attempt at all to deny it. In fact, he seemed glad, rather than otherwise, to have it out.

â€œYe did lie wiâ€™ the lass, then, Duncan?â€ Jamie asked directly, wanting to have the fact established.

â€œWell, no,â€ he said vaguely. â€œI should have liked to, oâ€™ courseâ€”but what wiâ€™ her sleeping in Joâ€™s dressing room . . .â€ At this reference to his wife, his face flushed a deep, unhealthy red.

â€œI mean, yeâ€™ve had carnal knowledge of the woman, have ye not?â€ Jamie said, keeping a grip on his patience.

â€œOh, aye.â€ He gulped. â€œAye. I did.â€

â€œHow?â€ I asked bluntly.

The flush deepened, to such a degree that I feared he might have an apoplexy on the spot. He breathed like a grampus for a bit, though, and finally, his complexion began to fade back to something like normal.

â€œShe fed me,â€ he said at last, rubbing a hand tiredly across his eyes. â€œEvery day.â€

Jocasta rose late and breakfasted in her sitting room, attended by Ulysses, to make plans for the day. Duncan, who had risen before dawn every day of his life, usually in the expectation of a dry crust or at most, a bit of drammachâ€”oatmeal mixed with waterâ€”woke now to find a steaming pot of tea beside his bed, accompanied by a bowl of creamy parritch, liberally garnished with honey and cream, toast drenched in butter, eggs fried with ham.

â€œSometimes a wee fish, rolled in cornmeal, crisp and sweet,â€ he added, with mournful reminiscence.

â€œWell, thatâ€™s verra seductive, to be sure, Duncan,â€ Jamie said, not without sympathy. â€œA manâ€™s vulnerable when heâ€™s hungry.â€ He gave me a wry glance. â€œBut still . . .â€

Duncan had been grateful to Phaedre for her kindness, and hadâ€”being a man, after allâ€”admired her beauty, though in a purely disinterested sort of way, he assured us.

â€œTo be sure,â€ Jamie said with marked skepticism. â€œWhat happened?â€

Duncan had dropped the butter, was the answer, whilst struggling to butter his toast one-handed. Phaedre had hastened to retrieve the pieces of the fallen dish, and then hurried to fetch a cloth and wipe the streaks of butter from the floorâ€”and then from Duncanâ€™s chest.

â€œWell, I was in my nightshirt,â€ he murmured, starting to go red again. â€œAnd she wasâ€”she hadâ€”â€ His hand rose and made vague motions in the vicinity of his chest, which I took to indicate that Phaedreâ€™s bodice had displayed her bosom to particular advantage while in such close proximity to him.

â€œAnd?â€ Jamie prompted ruthlessly.

And, it appeared, Duncanâ€™s anatomy had taken note of the factâ€”a circumstance admitted with such strangulated modesty that we could barely hear him.

â€œBut I thought you couldnâ€™tâ€”â€ I began.

â€œOh, I couldna,â€ he assured me hastily. â€œOnly at night, like, dreaming. But not waking, not since I had the accident. Perhaps it was being so early iâ€™ the morning; my cock thought I was still asleep.â€

Jamie made a low Scottish noise expressing considerable doubt as to this supposition, but urged Duncan to continue, with a certain amount of impatience.

Phaedre had taken notice in her turn, it transpired.

â€œShe was only sorry for me,â€ Duncan said frankly. â€œI could tell as much. But she put her hand on me, soft. So soft,â€ he repeated, almost inaudibly.

He had been sitting on his bedâ€”and had gone on sitting there in dumb amazement, as she took away the breakfast tray, lifted his nightshirt, climbed on the bed with her skirts neatly tucked above her round brown thighs, and with great tenderness and gentleness, had welcomed back his manhood.

â€œOnce?â€ Jamie demanded. â€œOr did ye keep doing it?â€

Duncan put his head in his hand, a fairly eloquent admission, under the circumstances.

â€œHow long did this . . . er . . . liaison go on?â€ I asked more gently.

Two months, perhaps three. Not every day, he hastened to addâ€”only now and then. And they had been very careful.

â€œI wouldna ever have wanted to shame Jo, ken,â€ he said very earnestly. â€œAnd I kent weel I shouldna be doing it, â€™twas a great sin, and yet I couldna keep fromâ€”â€ He broke, off, swallowing. â€œItâ€™s all my fault, whatâ€™s happened, let the sin be on me! Och, my puir darling lass . . .â€

He fell silent, shaking his head like an old, sad, flea-ridden dog. I felt terribly sorry for him, regardless of the morality of the situation. The collar of his shirt was turned awkwardly under, strands of his grizzled hair trapped beneath his coat; I gently pulled them out and straightened it, though he took no heed.

â€œDâ€™ye think sheâ€™s dead, Duncan?â€ Jamie asked quietly, and Duncan blanched, his skin going the same gray as his hair.

â€œI canna bring myself to think it, Mac Dubh,â€ he said, and his eyes filled with tears. â€œAndâ€”and yet . . .â€

Jamie and I exchanged uneasy glances. And yet. Phaedre had taken no money when she disappeared. How could a female slave travel very far without detection, advertised and hunted, lacking a horse, money, or anything beyond a pair of leather shoes? A man might possibly make it to the mountains, and manage to survive in the woods, if he were tough and resourcefulâ€”but a girl? A house slave?

Someone had taken herâ€”or else she was dead.

None of us wanted to voice that thought, though. Jamie heaved a great sigh, and taking a clean handkerchief from his sleeve, put it in Duncanâ€™s hand.

â€œI shall pray for her, Duncanâ€”wherever she may be. And for you, a charaid . . . and for you.â€

Duncan nodded, not looking up, the handkerchief clutched tight. It was clear that any attempt at comfort would be futile, and so at last we left him sitting there, in his tiny, landlocked room, so far from the sea.

We made our way back slowly, not speaking, but holding hands, feeling the strong need to touch each other. The day was bright, but there was a storm coming up; ragged clouds were streaming in from the east, and the breeze came in gusts that whirled my skirts about like a twirling parasol.

The wind was less on the back terrace, sheltered as it was by its waist-high wall. Looking up from here, I could just see the window that Phaedre had been looking out of when Iâ€™d found her there, the night of the barbecue.

â€œShe told me that something wasnâ€™t right,â€ I said. â€œThe night of Mrs. MacDonaldâ€™s barbecue. Something was troubling her then.â€

Jamie shot me an interested glance.

â€œOh, aye? But she didna mean Duncan, surely?â€ he objected.

â€œI know.â€ I shrugged helplessly. â€œShe didnâ€™t seem to know what was wrong herselfâ€”she just kept saying, â€˜Something ainâ€™t right.â€™â€

Jamie took a deep breath and blew it out again, shaking his head.

â€œIn a way, I suppose I hope that whatever it was, it had to do with her going. For if it wasna to do with her and Duncan . . .â€ He trailed off, but I had no difficulty in finishing the thought.

â€œThen it wasnâ€™t to do with your aunt, either,â€ I said. â€œJamieâ€”do you really think Jocasta might have had her killed?â€

It should have sounded ridiculous, spoken aloud like that. The horrible thing was that it didnâ€™t.

Jamie made that small, shrugging gesture he used when very uncomfortable about something, as though his coat was too tight.

â€œHad she her sight, I should think itâ€”possible, at least,â€ he said. â€œTo be betrayed by Hectorâ€”and she blamed him already, for the death of her girls. So her daughters are dead, but there is Phaedre, alive, every day, a constant reminder of insult. And then to be betrayed yet again, by Duncan, with Hectorâ€™s daughter?â€

He rubbed a knuckle under his nose. â€œI should think any woman of spirit might be . . . moved.â€

â€œYes,â€ I said, imagining what I might think or feel under the same circumstances. â€œCertainly. But to murderâ€”that is what weâ€™re talking about, isnâ€™t it? Couldnâ€™t she simply have sold the girl?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said thoughtfully. â€œShe couldnâ€™t. We made provision to safeguard her money when she wedâ€”but not the property. Duncan is the owner of River Runâ€”and all that goes with it.â€

â€œIncluding Phaedre.â€ I felt hollow, and a little sick.

â€œAs I said. Had she her sight, I shouldna be astonished at all by the thought. As it is . . .â€

â€œUlysses,â€ I said, with certainty, and he nodded reluctantly. Ulysses was not only Jocastaâ€™s eyes, but her hands, as well. I didnâ€™t think he would have killed Phaedre at his mistressâ€™s commandâ€”but if Jocasta had poisoned the girl, for instance, Ulysses might certainly have helped to dispose of the body.

I felt an odd air of unrealityâ€”even with what I knew of the MacKenzie family, calmly discussing the possibility of Jamieâ€™s aged aunt having murdered someone . . . and yet . . . I did know the MacKenzies.

â€œIf my aunt had any hand at all in the matter,â€ Jamie said. â€œAfter all, Duncan said they were discreet. And it may be the lass was taken offâ€”perhaps by the man my aunt recalls from Coigach. It could be heâ€™d think Phaedre might help him to the gold, no?â€

That was a somewhat happier thought. And it did fit with Phaedreâ€™s premonitionâ€”if thatâ€™s what it wasâ€”which had occurred the same day that the man from Coigach came.

â€œI suppose all we can do is pray for her, poor thing,â€ I said. â€œI donâ€™t suppose thereâ€™s a patron saint of abducted persons, is there?â€

â€œSaint Dagobert,â€ he replied promptly, causing me to stare at him.

â€œYouâ€™re making that up.â€

â€œIndeed I am not,â€ he said with dignity. â€œSaint Athelais is another oneâ€”and perhaps better, now I think. She was a young Roman lass, who was abducted by the Emperor Justinian, who wished to have his way wiâ€™ her, and she vowed to chastity. But she escaped and went off to live with her uncle in Benevento.â€

â€œGood for her. And Saint Dagobert?â€

â€œA king of some sortâ€”Frankish? Anyway, his guardian took against him as a child, and had him kidnapped away to England, so the guardianâ€™s son might reign instead.â€

â€œWhere do you learn these things?â€ I demanded.

â€œFrom Brother Polycarp, at the Abbey of St. Anne,â€ he said, the corner of his mouth tucking back in a smile. â€œWhen I couldna sleep, heâ€™d come and tell me stories of the saints, hours on end. It didna always put me to sleep, but after an hour or so of hearing about holy martyrs having their breasts amputated or being flogged wiâ€™ iron hooks, Iâ€™d close my eyes and make a decent pretense of it.â€

Jamie took my cap off and set it on the ledge. The air blew through my inch of hair, ruffling it like meadow grass, and he smiled as he looked at me.

â€œYe look like a boy, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œThough damned if Iâ€™ve ever seen a lad with an arse like yours.â€

â€œThanks so much,â€ I said, absurdly pleased. I had eaten like a horse in the last two months, slept well and deeply through the nights, and knew I was much improved in looks, hair notwithstanding. Never hurt to hear it, though.

â€œI want ye verra much, mo nighean donn,â€ he said softly, and curled his fingers round my wrist, letting the pads rest gently on my pulse.

â€œSo the MacKenzies of Leoch are all prone to black jealousy,â€ I said. I could feel my pulse, steady under his fingers. â€œCharming, cunning, and given to betrayal.â€ I touched his lip, ran my thumb lightly along it, the tiny prickles of beard pleasant to the touch. â€œAll of them?â€

He looked down, fixing me suddenly with a dark blue gaze in which humor and ruefulness were mingled with a good many other things I couldnâ€™t read.

â€œYe think I am not?â€ he said, and smiled a little sadly. â€œGod and Mary bless ye, Sassenach.â€ And bent to kiss me.



WE COULD NOT TARRY at River Run. The fields down here on the piedmont had long since been harvested and turned under, the remnants of dried stalks flecking the fresh dark earth; snow would fly soon in the mountains.

We had discussed the matter round and roundâ€”but came to no useful conclusion. There was nothing further we could do to help Phaedreâ€”except to pray. Beyond that, though . . . there was Duncan to think of.

For it had occurred to both of us that if Jocasta had found out about his liaison with Phaedre, her wrath was not likely to be limited to the slave girl. She might bide her timeâ€”but she would not forget the injury. Iâ€™d never met a Scot who would.

We took our leave of Jocasta after breakfast the next day, finding her in her private parlor, embroidering a table runner. The basket of silk threads sat in her lap, the colors carefully arrayed in a spiral, so that she could choose the one she wanted by touch, and the finished linen fell to one side, five feet of cloth edged with an intricate design of apples, leaves, and vinesâ€”or no, I realized, when I picked up the end of the cloth to admire it. Not vines. Black-eyed serpents, coiling slyly, slithering, green and scaly. Here and there one gaped to show its fangs, guarding scattered red fruit.

â€œGarden of Eden,â€ she explained to me, rubbing the design lightly betwixt her fingers.

â€œHow beautiful,â€ I said, wondering how long sheâ€™d been working on it. Had she begun it before Phaedreâ€™s disappearance?

A bit of casual talk, and then Josh the groom appeared to say that our horses were ready. Jamie nodded, dismissing him, and stood.

â€œAunt,â€ he said to Jocasta matter-of-factly, â€œI should take it verra much amiss were any harm to come to Duncan.â€

She stiffened, fingers halting in their work.

â€œWhy should any harm come to him?â€ she asked, lifting her chin.

Jamie didnâ€™t reply at once, but stood regarding her, not without sympathy. Then he leaned down, so that she could feel his presence close, his mouth near her ear.

â€œI know, Aunt,â€ he said softly. â€œAnd if ye dinna wish anyone else to share that knowledge . . . then I think I shall find Duncan in good health when I return.â€

She sat as though turned to salt. Jamie stood up, nodding toward the door, and we took our leave. I glanced back from the hallway, and saw her still sitting like a statue, face as white as the linen in her hands and the little balls of colored thread all fallen from her lap, unraveling across the polished floor.

DOUBLE-DEALING




WITH MARSALI GONE, the whisky-making became more difficult. Among us, Bree and Mrs. Bug and I had managed to get off one more malting before the weather became too cold and rainy, but it was a near thing, and it was with great relief that I saw the last of the malted grain safely decanted into the still. Once set to ferment, the stuff became Jamieâ€™s responsibility, as he trusted no one else with the delicate job of judging taste and proof.

The fire beneath the still had to be kept at exactly the right level, though, to keep fermentation going without killing the mash, then raised for the distillings once fermentation was complete. This meant that he livedâ€”and sleptâ€”beside the still for the few days necessary for each batch to come off. I generally brought him supper and stayed until the dark came, but it was lonely without him in my bed, and I was more than pleased when we poured the last of the new making into casks.

â€œOh, that smells good.â€ I sniffed beatifically at the inside of an empty cask; it was one of the special casks Jamie had obtained through one of Lord Johnâ€™s shipping friendsâ€”charred inside like a normal whisky cask, but previously used to store sherry. The sweet mellow ghost of the sherry mingled with the faint scent of char and the hot, raw reek of the new whisky were together enough to make my head spin pleasantly.

â€œAye, itâ€™s a small batch, but no bad,â€ Jamie agreed, inhaling the aroma like a perfume connoisseur. He lifted his head and eyed the sky overhead; the wind was coming up strong, and thick clouds were racing past, dark-bellied and threatening.

â€œThereâ€™s only the three casks,â€ he said. â€œIf ye think ye might manage one, Sassenach, Iâ€™ll take the others. I should like to have them safe, rather than dig them out of a snowbank next week.â€

A half-mile walk in a roaring wind, carrying or rolling a six-gallon cask, was no joke, but he was right about the snow. It wasnâ€™t quite cold enough for snow yet, but it would be soon. I sighed, but nodded, and between us, we managed to lug the casks slowly up to the whisky cache, hidden among rocks and ragged grapevines.

I had quite regained my strength, but even so, every muscle I had was trembling and jerking in protest by the time we had finished, and I made no objection at all when Jamie made me sit down to rest before heading back to the house.

â€œWhat do you plan to do with these?â€ I asked, nodding back toward the cache. â€œKeep, or sell?â€

He wiped a flying strand of hair out of his face, squinting against a blast of flying dust and dead leaves.

â€œIâ€™ll have to sell one, for the spring seed. Weâ€™ll keep one to ageâ€”and I think perhaps I can put the last to good purpose. If Bobby Higgins comes again before the snow, I shall send a half-dozen bottles to Ashe, Harnett, Howe, and a few othersâ€”a wee token of my abiding esteem, aye?â€ He grinned wryly at me.

â€œWell, Iâ€™ve heard of worse bona fides,â€ I said, amused. It had taken him a good deal of work to worm his way back into the good graces of the North Carolina Committee of Correspondence, but several members had begun answering his letters againâ€”cautiously, but with respect.

â€œI shouldna think anything important will happen over the winter,â€ he said thoughtfully, rubbing his cold-reddened nose.

â€œLikely not.â€ Massachusetts, where most of the uproar had been taking place, was now occupied by a General Gage, and the latest we had heard was that he had fortified Boston Neck, the narrow spit of land that connects the city to the mainlandâ€”which meant that Boston was now cut off from the rest of the colony, and under seige.

I felt a small pang, thinking of it; I had lived in Boston for nearly twenty years, and was fond of the cityâ€”though I knew I would not recognize it now.

â€œJohn Hancockâ€”heâ€™s a merchant thereâ€”is heading the Committee of Safety, Ashe says. Theyâ€™ve voted to recruit twelve thousand militia, and are looking to purchase five thousand musketsâ€”with the trouble I had to find thirty, good luck to them, is all I can say.â€

I laughed, but before I could reply, Jamie stiffened.

â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ His head turned sharply, and he laid a hand on my arm. Silenced abruptly, I held my breath, listening. The wind stirred the drying leaves of wild grapevines with a papery rustle behind me, and in the distance a murder of crows passed, squabbling in shrill cries.

Then I heard it, too: a small, desolate, and very human sound. Jamie was already on his feet, making his way with care between the fallen rocks. He ducked beneath the lintel made by a leaning slab of granite, and I made to follow him. He stopped abruptly, nearly making me run into him.

â€œJoseph?â€ he said incredulously.

I peered around him as best I could. To my equal astonishment, it was Mr. Wemyss, sitting hunched on a boulder, a stone jug between his bony knees. Heâ€™d been crying; his nose and eyes were red, making him look even more like a white mouse than usual. He was also extremely drunk.

â€œOh,â€ he said, blinking in dismay at us. â€œOh.â€

â€œAre ye . . . quite well, Joseph?â€ Jamie came closer, extending a hand gingerly, as though afraid that Mr. Wemyss might crack into pieces if touched.

This instinct was sound; when he touched the little man, Mr. Wemyssâ€™s face crumpled like paper, and his thin shoulders began to shake uncontrollably.

â€œI am so sorry, sir,â€ he kept saying, quite dissolved in tears. â€œIâ€™m so sorry!â€

Jamie gave me a â€œdo something, Sassenachâ€ look of appeal, and I knelt swiftly, putting my arms round Mr. Wemyssâ€™s shoulders, patting his slender back.

â€œNow, now,â€ I said, giving Jamie a â€œnow what?â€ sort of look over Mr. Wemyssâ€™s matchstick shoulder in return. â€œIâ€™m sure it will be all right.â€

â€œOh, no,â€ he said, hiccuping. â€œOh, no, it canâ€™t.â€ He turned a face streaming with woe toward Jamie. â€œI canâ€™t bear it, sir, truly I canâ€™t.â€

Mr. Wemyssâ€™s bones felt thin and brittle, and he was shivering. He was wearing only a thin shirt and breeches, and the wind was beginning to whine through the rocks. Clouds thickened overhead, and the light went from the little hollow, suddenly, as though a blackout curtain had been dropped.

Jamie unfastened his own cloak and wrapped it rather awkwardly round Mr. Wemyss, then lowered himself carefully onto another boulder.

â€œTell me the trouble, Joseph,â€ he said quite gently. â€œIs someone dead, then?â€

Mr. Wemyss sank his face into his hands, head shaking to and fro like a metronome. He muttered something, which I understood to be â€œBetter if she were.â€

â€œLizzie?â€ I asked, exchanging a puzzled glance with Jamie. â€œIs it Lizzie you mean?â€ Sheâ€™d been perfectly all right at breakfast; what on earthâ€”

â€œFirst Manfred McGillivray,â€ Mr. Wemyss said, raising his face from his hands, â€œand then Higgins. As though a degenerate and a murderer were not bad enoughâ€”now this!â€

Jamieâ€™s brows shot up and he looked at me. I shrugged slightly. The gravel was jabbing sharply into my knees; I rose stiffly and brushed it away.

â€œAre you saying that Lizzie is, er . . . in love with someone . . . unsuitable?â€ I asked carefully.

Mr. Wemyss shuddered.

â€œUnsuitable,â€ he said, in a hollow tone. â€œJesus Christ. Unsuitable!â€

Iâ€™d never heard Mr. Wemyss blaspheme before; it was unsettling.

He turned wild eyes on me, looking like a crazed sparrow, huddled in the depths of Jamieâ€™s cloak.

â€œI gave up everything for her!â€ he said. â€œI sold myselfâ€”and gladly!â€”to save her from dishonor. I left home, left Scotland, knowing I should never see it more, that I should leave my bones in the soil of the strangers. And yet Iâ€™ve said nay word of reproach to her, my dear wee lassie, for how should it be her fault? And now . . .â€ He turned a hollow, haunted gaze on Jamie.

â€œMy God, my God. What shall I do?â€ he whispered. A blast of wind thundered through the rocks and whipped the cloak around him, momentarily obliterating him in a shroud of gray, as though distress had quite engulfed him.

I kept tight hold of my own cloak, to prevent it being torn off me; the wind was strong enough that I nearly lost my footing. Jamie squinted against the spray of dust and fine gravel that blasted us, setting his teeth in discomfort. He wrapped his arms around himself, shivering.

â€œIs the lass with child, then, Joseph?â€ he said, obviously wanting to get to the bottom of things and go home.

Mr. Wemyssâ€™s head popped out of the folds of cloak, fair hair tousled into broomstraw. Blinking reddened eyes, he nodded, then excavated the jug and, raising it in trembling hands, took several gulps. I saw the single â€œXâ€ marked on the jug; with his characteristic modesty, he had taken a jug of the raw new whisky, not the cask-aged higher quality.

Jamie sighed, reached out a hand, and taking the jug from him, took a healthy gulp himself.

â€œWho?â€ he said, handing it back. â€œIs it my nephew?â€

Mr. Wemyss stared at him, owl-eyed.

â€œYour nephew?â€

â€œIan Murray,â€ I put in helpfully. â€œTall brown-haired lad? Tattoos?â€

Jamie gave me a look suggesting that I was perhaps not being quite so helpful as I thought, but Mr. Wemyss went on looking blank.

â€œIan Murray?â€ Then the name appeared to penetrate through the alcoholic fog. â€œOh. No. Christ, if it were! I should bless the lad,â€ he said fervently.

I exchanged another look with Jamie. This looked like being serious.

â€œJoseph,â€ he said with just a touch of menace. â€œItâ€™s cold.â€ He wiped his nose on the back of his hand. â€œWhoâ€™s debauched your daughter? Give me his name, and Iâ€™ll see him wed to her in the morning or dead at her feet, whichever ye like. But letâ€™s do it inside by the fire, aye?â€

â€œBeardsley,â€ Mr. Wemyss said, in a tone suggesting visions of utter despair.

â€œBeardsley?â€ Jamie repeated. He raised one eyebrow at me. It wasnâ€™t what I would have expectedâ€”but hearing it came as no great shock, either.

â€œWhich Beardsley was it?â€ he asked, with relative patience. â€œJo? Or Kezzie?â€

Mr. Wemyss heaved a sigh that came from the bottoms of his feet.

â€œShe doesnâ€™t know,â€ he said flatly.

â€œChrist,â€ said Jamie involuntarily. He reached for the whisky again, and drank heavily.

â€œAhem,â€ I said, giving him a meaningful look as he lowered the jug. He surrendered it to me without comment, and straightened himself on his boulder, shirt plastered against his chest by the wind, his hair whipped loose behind him.

â€œWell, then,â€ he said firmly. â€œWeâ€™ll have the two of them in, and find out the truth of it.â€

â€œNo,â€ said Mr. Wemyss, â€œwe wonâ€™t. They donâ€™t know, either.â€

I had just taken a mouthful of raw spirit. At this, I choked, spluttering whisky down my chin.

â€œThey what?â€ I croaked, wiping my face with a corner of my cloak. â€œYou mean . . . both of them?â€

Mr. Wemyss looked at me. Instead of replying, though, he blinked once. Then his eyes rolled up into his head and he fell headlong off the boulder, poleaxed.



I MANAGED TO RESTORE Mr. Wemyss to semiconsciousness, but not to the point of his being able to walk. Jamie was therefore obliged to carry the little man slung across his shoulders like a deer carcass; no mean feat, considering the broken ground that lay between the whisky cache and the new malting floor, and the wind that pelted us with bits of gravel, leaves, and flying pinecones. Clouds had boiled up over the shoulder of the mountain, dark and dirty as laundry suds, and were spreading rapidly across the sky. We were going to get drenched, if we didnâ€™t hurry.

The going became easier once we reached the trail to the house, but Jamieâ€™s temper was not improved by Mr. Wemyssâ€™s suddenly coming to at this point and vomiting down the front of his shirt. After a hasty attempt at swabbing off the mess, we reorganized our strategy, and made our way with Mr. Wemyss precariously balanced between us, each firmly gripping one elbow as he slipped and stumbled, his spindly knees giving way at unexpected moments, like Pinocchio with his strings cut.

Jamie was talking to himself volubly in Gaelic under his breath during this phase of the journey, but desisted abruptly when we came into the dooryard. One of the Beardsley twins was there, catching chickens for Mrs. Bug before the storm; he had two of them, held upside down by the legs like an ungainly bouquet of brown and yellow. He stopped when he saw us, and stared curiously at Mr. Wemyss.

â€œWhatâ€”â€ began the boy. He got no further. Jamie dropped Mr. Wemyssâ€™s arm, took two strides, and punched the Beardsley twin in the stomach with sufficient force that he doubled over, dropped the chickens, staggered back, and fell down. The chickens flapped off in a cloud of scattered feathers, squawking.

The boy writhed about on the ground, mouth opening and closing in a vain search for air, but Jamie paid no attention. He stooped, seized the lad by the hair, and spoke loudly and directly into his earâ€”in case it was Kezzie, I supposed.

â€œFetch your brother. To my study. Now.â€

Mr. Wemyss had been watching this interesting tableau, one arm draped across my shoulders for support and his mouth hanging open. It continued to hang open as he turned his head, following Jamie as he strode back toward us. He blinked, though, and shut it, as Jamie seized his other arm and, removing him neatly from me, propelled him into the house without a backward glance.

I gazed reproachfully at the Beardsley on the ground.

â€œHow could you?â€ I said.

He made soundless goldfish mouths at me, his eyes completely round, then managed a long heeeeee sound of inhalation, his face dark purple.

â€œJo? Whatâ€™s the matter, are ye hurt?â€ Lizzie came out of the trees, a pair of chickens clutched by the legs in either hand. She was frowning worriedly atâ€”well, I supposed it was Jo; if anyone could tell the difference, it would surely be Lizzie.

â€œNo, heâ€™s not hurt,â€ I assured her. â€œYet.â€ I pointed a monitory finger at her. â€œYou, young lady, go and put those chickens in their coop and thenâ€”â€ I hesitated, glancing at the boy on the ground, who had recovered enough breath to gasp and was gingerly sitting up. I didnâ€™t want to bring her into my surgery, not if Jamie and Mr. Wemyss were going to be eviscerating the Beardsleys right across the hall.

â€œIâ€™ll go with you,â€ I decided hastily, gesturing her away from Jo. â€œShoo.â€

â€œButâ€”â€ She cast a bewildered glance at Joâ€”yes, it was Jo; he ran a hand through his hair to get it out of his face, and I saw the scarred thumb.

â€œHeâ€™s fine,â€ I said, turning her toward the chicken coop with a firm hand on her shoulder. â€œGo.â€

I glanced back, to see that Jo Beardsley had made it to his feet and, with a hand pressed to his tender middle, was making off toward the stable, presumably to fetch his twin as ordered.

I glanced back at Lizzie, giving her a narrow eye. If Mr. Wemyss had the right end of the stick and she was pregnant, she was evidently one of those fortunate persons who doesnâ€™t suffer from morning sickness or the usual digestive symptoms of early pregnancy; she was, in fact, very healthy-looking.

That in itself should have alerted me, I supposed, pale and green-stick as she normally was. Now that I looked carefully, there seemed to be a soft pink glow about her, and her pale blond hair was shiny where it peeped out under her cap.

â€œHow far along are you?â€ I asked, holding back a branch for her. She gave me a quick look, gulped visibly, then ducked under the branch.

â€œAbout four months gone, I think,â€ she said meekly, not looking at me. â€œUm . . . Da told ye, did he?â€

â€œYes. Your poor father,â€ I said severely. â€œIs he right? Both of the Beardsleys?â€

She hunched her shoulders a little, head bowed, but nodded, almost imperceptibly.

â€œWhatâ€”what will Himself do to them?â€ she asked, her voice small and tremulous.

â€œI really donâ€™t know.â€ I doubted that Jamie himself had formed any specific notionsâ€”though he had mentioned having the miscreant responsible for Lizzieâ€™s pregnancy dead at her feet if her father wished it.

Now that I thought, the alternativeâ€”having her wed by morningâ€”was likely to be somewhat more problematic than simply killing the twins would be.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I repeated. We had reached the coop, a stoutly built edifice that sheltered under a spreading maple. Several of the hens, slightly less stupid than their sisters, were roosting like huge, ripe fruits in the lower branches, heads buried in their feathers.

I pulled open the door, releasing a gust of ripe ammonia from the dark interior, and holding my breath against the stink, pulled the hens from the tree and tossed them brusquely inside. Lizzie ran into the woods nearby, snatching chickens out from under bushes and rushing back to shove them in. Large drops were beginning to plummet from the clouds, heavy as pebbles, making small, audible splats as they struck the leaves above.

â€œHurry!â€ I slammed the door behind the last of the squawking chickens, threw the latch, and seized Lizzie by the arm. Borne on a whoosh of wind, we ran for the house, skirts whirling up round us like pigeonsâ€™ wings.

The summer kitchen was nearest; we burst through the door just as the rain came down with a roar, a solid sheet of water that struck the tin roof with a sound like anvils falling.

We stood panting inside. Lizzieâ€™s cap had come off in flight, and her plait had come undone, so that her hair straggled over her shoulders in strands of shining, creamy blond; a noticeable change from the wispy, flyaway look she usually shared with her father. If I had seen her without her cap, I should have known at once. I took time to recover my breath, trying to decide what on earth to say to her.

She was making a great to-do over tidying herself, panting and pulling at her bodice, smoothing her skirtsâ€”all the while trying not to meet my eye.

Well, there was one question that had been niggling at me since Mr. Wemyssâ€™s shocking revelation; best to get that one out of the way at once. The initial roar of the rain had slackened to a regular drumbeat; it was loud, but conversation was at least possible.

â€œLizzie.â€ She looked up from her skirt-settling, slightly startled. â€œTell me the truth,â€ I said. I put my hands on either side of her face, looking earnestly into her pale blue eyes. â€œWas it rape?â€

She blinked, the look of absolute amazement that suffused her features more eloquent than any spoken denial could have been.

â€œOh, no, maâ€™am!â€ she said just as earnestly. â€œYe couldna think Jo or Kezzie would do such a thing?â€ Her small pink lips twitched slightly. â€œWhat, did ye think they maybe took it in turns to hold me down?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said tartly, releasing her. â€œBut I thought Iâ€™d best ask, just in case.â€

I hadnâ€™t really thought so. But the Beardsleys were such an odd mix of the civil and the feral that it was impossible to say definitely what they might or might not do.

â€œBut it was . . . er . . . both of them? Thatâ€™s what your father said. Poor man,â€ I added, with a tone of some reproach.

â€œOh.â€ She cast down her pale lashes, pretending to find a loose thread on her skirt. â€œUmmm . . . well, aye, it was. I do feel something terrible about shaming Da so. And it wasna really that we did it a-purpose . . .â€

â€œElizabeth Wemyss,â€ I said, with no little asperity, â€œrape asideâ€”and weâ€™ve ruled that outâ€”it is not possible to engage in sexual relations with two men without meaning to. One, maybe, but not two. Come to that . . .â€ I hesitated, but vulgar curiosity was simply too much. â€œBoth at once?â€

She did look shocked at that, which was something of a relief.

â€œOh, no, maâ€™am! It was . . . I mean, I didna ken that it . . .â€ She trailed off, quite pink in the face.

I pulled two stools out from under the table and pushed one toward her.

â€œSit down,â€ I said, â€œand tell me about it. We arenâ€™t going anywhere for a bit,â€ I added, glancing through the half-open door at the downpour outside. A silver haze rose knee-high over the yard, as the raindrops struck the grass in small explosions of mist, and the sharp smell of it washed through the room.

Lizzie hesitated, but took the stool; I could see her making up her mind to it that there was really nothing to do now but explainâ€”assuming that the situation could be explained.

â€œYou, um, said you didnâ€™t know,â€ I said, trying to offer her an opening. â€œYou meanâ€”you thought it was only one twin, but they, er, fooled you?â€

â€œWell, aye,â€ she said, and took a huge breath of the chilly air. â€œSomething like that. See, â€™twas when you and Himself went to Bethabara for the new goat. Mrs. Bug was down wiâ€™ the lumbago, and it was only me and Da in the houseâ€”but then he went down to Woolamâ€™s for to fetch the flour, and so it was just me.â€

â€œTo Bethabara? That was six months ago! And youâ€™re four months goneâ€”you mean all this time youâ€™ve beenâ€”well, never mind. What happened, then?â€

â€œThe fever,â€ she said simply. â€œIt came back.â€

She had been gathering firewood when the first malarial chill struck her. Recognizing it for what it was, she had dropped the wood and tried to reach the house, only to fall halfway there, her muscles going slack as string.

â€œI lay upon the ground,â€ she explained, â€œand I could feel the fever cominâ€™ for me. Itâ€™s like a great beast, aye? I can feel it seize me in its jaws and biteâ€”â€™tis like my blood runs hot and then cold, and the teeth of it sink into my bones. I can feel it set in then, to try to break them in twa, and suck the marrow.â€ She shuddered in memory.

One of the Beardsleysâ€”she thought it was Kezzie, but had been in no state of mind to askâ€”had discovered her lying in a disheveled heap in the dooryard. Heâ€™d run to fetch his brother, and the two of them had raised her, carried her between them into the house, and fetched her upstairs to her bed.

â€œMy teeth were clackinâ€™ so hard together I thought theyâ€™d break, surely, but I told them to fetch the ointment, wiâ€™ the gallberries, the ointment yeâ€™d made.â€

They had rummaged through the surgery cupboard until they found it, and then, frantic as she burned hotter and hotter, had stripped off her shoes and stockings and begun to rub the ointment into her hands and feet.

â€œI told themâ€”I told them they must rub it all over,â€ she said, her cheeks going a deep peony. She looked down, fiddling with a strand of hair. â€œI wasâ€”well, I was quite oot my mind wiâ€™ the fever, maâ€™am, truly I was. But I kent I needed my medicine bad.â€

I nodded, beginning to understand. I didnâ€™t blame her; Iâ€™d seen the malaria overpower her. And so far as that went, sheâ€™d done the right thing; she did need the medicine, and couldnâ€™t have managed to apply it herself.

Frantic, the two boys had done as sheâ€™d said, got her clothes awkwardly off, and rubbed the ointment thoroughly into every inch of her naked body.

â€œI was goinâ€™ in and oot a bit,â€ she explained, â€œwiâ€™ the fever dreams walkinâ€™ oot my heid and about the room, so itâ€™s all a bit mixed, what I recall. But I do think one oâ€™ the lads said to the other as he was getting the ointment all over, and would spoil his shirt, best take it off.â€

â€œI see,â€ I said, seeing vividly. â€œAnd then . . .â€

And then she had quite lost track of what was happening, save that whenever she drifted to the surface of the fever, the boys were still there, talking to her and each other, the murmur of their voices a small anchor to reality and their hands never leaving her, stroking and smoothing and the sharp smell of gallberries cutting through the woodsmoke from the hearth and the scent of beeswax from the candle.

â€œI felt . . . safe,â€ she said, struggling to express it. â€œI dinna remember much in particular, only opening my eyes once and seeinâ€™ his chest right before my face, and the dark curlies all round his paps, and them wee and brown and wrinkled, like raisins.â€ She turned her face to me, eyes still rounded at the memory. â€œI can still see that, like as it was right in front oâ€™ me this minute. Thatâ€™s queer, no?â€

â€œYes,â€ I agreed, though in fact it was not; there was something about high fever that blurred reality but at the same time could sear certain images so deeply into the mind that they never left. â€œAnd then . . . ?â€

Then she had begun to shake violently with chills, which neither more quilts nor a hot stone at her feet had helped. And so one of the boys, in desperation, had crawled under the quilts beside her and held her against him, trying to drive out the cold from her bones with his own heatâ€”which, I thought cynically, must have been considerable, at that point.

â€œI dinna ken which it was, or if it was the same one all night, or if they changed now and then, but whenever I woke, he was there, wiâ€™ his arms about me. And sometimes heâ€™d put back the blanket and rub more ointment down my back and, and, round . . .â€ She stumbled, blushing. â€œBut when I woke in the morning, the fever was gone, like it always is on the second day.â€

She looked at me, pleading for understanding.

â€œDâ€™ye ken how that is, maâ€™am, when a great feverâ€™s broken? â€™Tis the same every time, so Iâ€™m thinking it may be so for everyone. But itâ€™s . . . peaceful. Your limbs are sae heavy ye canna think of moving, but ye dinna much care. And everything ye seeâ€”all the wee things ye take nay notice of day by dayâ€”ye notice, and theyâ€™re beautiful,â€ she said simply. â€œI think sometimes that will be how it is when Iâ€™m dead. I shall just wake, and everything will be like that, peaceful and beautifulâ€”save I shall be able to move.â€

â€œBut you woke this time, and couldnâ€™t,â€ I said. â€œAnd the boyâ€”whichever it wasâ€”he was still there, with you?â€

â€œIt was Jo,â€ she said, nodding. â€œHe spoke to me, but I didna pay much mind to what he said, and I dinna think he did, either.â€

She bit her lower lip momentarily, the small teeth sharp and white.

â€œIâ€”I hadna done it before, maâ€™am. But I came close, a time or two wiâ€™ Manfred. And closer still wiâ€™ Bobby Higgins. But Jo hadna ever even kissed a lass, nor his brother had, either. So ye see, â€™twas really my fault, for I kent well enough what was happening, but . . . we were both slippery wiâ€™ the ointment, still, and naked under the quilts, and it . . . happened.â€

I nodded, understanding precisely and in detail.

â€œYes, I can see how it happened, all right. But then it . . . er . . . went on happening, I suppose?â€

Her lips pursed up and she went very pink again.

â€œWell . . . aye. It did. Itâ€”it feels sae nice, maâ€™am,â€ she whispered, leaning a little toward me as though imparting an important secret.

I rubbed a knuckle hard across my lips.

â€œUm, yes. Quite. Butâ€”â€

The Beardsleys had washed the sheets at her direction, and there were no incriminating traces left by the time her father returned, two days later. The gallberries had done their work, and while she was still weak and tired, she told Mr. Wemyss only that she had had a mild attack.

Meanwhile, she met with Jo at every opportunity, in the deep summer grass behind the dairy shed, in the fresh straw in the stableâ€”and when it rained, now and then on the porch of the Beardsleysâ€™ cabin.

â€œI wouldna do it inside, for the stink oâ€™ the hides,â€ she explained. â€œBut we put an old quilt on the porch, so as I shouldna have splinters in my backside, and the rain cominâ€™ down just a foot away . . .â€ She looked wistfully through the open door, where the rain had softened into a steady whisper, the needles trembling on the pine trees as it fell.

â€œAnd what about Kezzie? Where was he, while all this was going on?â€ I asked.

â€œAh. Well, Kezzie,â€ she said, taking a deep breath.

They had made love in the stable, and Jo had left her lying on her cloak in the straw, watching as he rose and dressed himself. Then he had kissed her and turned to the door. Seeing that he had forgotten his canteen, she called softly after him.

â€œAnd he didna answer, nor turn round,â€ she said. â€œAnd it came to me sudden, as he didna hear me.â€

â€œOh, I see,â€ I said softly. â€œYou, um, couldnâ€™t tell the difference?â€

She gave me a direct blue look.

â€œI can now,â€ she said.

In the beginning, though, sex was so newâ€”and the brothers both sufficiently inexperiencedâ€”that she hadnâ€™t noticed any differences.

â€œHow long . . . ?â€ I asked. â€œI mean, do you have any idea when they, er . . . ?â€

â€œNot for certain,â€ she admitted. â€œBut if I was to guess about it, I think the first time it was Joâ€”no, I ken for sure that was Jo, for I saw his thumbâ€”but the second time, it was likely Kezzie. They share, ken?â€

They did shareâ€”everything. And so it was the most natural thing in the worldâ€”to all three of them, evidentlyâ€”that Jo should wish his brother to share in this new marvel.

â€œI ken it seems . . . strange,â€ she said, shrugging a little. â€œAnd I suppose I ought to have said something, or done somethingâ€”but I couldna think what. And reallyâ€â€”she raised her eyes to me, helplessâ€”â€œit didna seem wrong at all. Theyâ€™re different, aye, but at the same time, theyâ€™re sae close to each other . . . well, itâ€™s just as if I was touching the one lad, and talking to himâ€”only heâ€™s got the twa bodies.â€

â€œTwa bodies,â€ I said, a little bleakly. â€œWell, yes. Thereâ€™s just the difficulty, you see, the two bodies part.â€ I eyed her closely. Despite the history of malaria and her fine-boned build, she had definitely filled out; she had a plump little bosom swelling over the edge of her bodice, and, while she was sitting on it so I couldnâ€™t tell for sure, very likely a bottom to match. The only real wonder was that it had taken her three months to fall pregnant.

As though reading my mind, she said, â€œI took the seeds, aye? The ones you and Miss Bree take. I had a store put by, from when I was betrothed to Manfred; Miss Bree gave me them. I meant to gather more, but I didna always remember, andâ€”â€ She shrugged again, putting her hands across her belly.

â€œWhereupon you proceeded to say nothing,â€ I observed. â€œDid your father find out by accident?â€

â€œNo, I told him,â€ she said. â€œI thought I best had, before I began to show. Jo and Kezzie came with me.â€

This explained Mr. Wemyssâ€™s resort to strong drink, all right. Perhaps we should have brought the jug back with us.

â€œYour poor father,â€ I said again, but abstractedly. â€œHad the three of you worked out any sort of plan?â€

â€œWell, no,â€ she admitted. â€œI hadna told the lads I was in a family way â€™til this morning, either. They seemed taken back a bit,â€ she added, biting her lip again.

â€œI daresay.â€ I glanced outside; it was still raining, but the downpour had slackened momentarily, dimpling the puddles on the path. I rubbed a hand over my face, feeling suddenly rather tired.

â€œWhich one will you choose?â€ I asked.

She gave me a sudden, startled look, the blood draining from her cheeks.

â€œYou canâ€™t have them both, you know,â€ I said gently. â€œIt doesnâ€™t work that way.â€

â€œWhy?â€ she said, trying for boldnessâ€”but her voice trembled. â€œItâ€™s no harming anyone. And itâ€™s no oneâ€™s business but ours.â€

I began to feel the need of a stiff drink myself.

â€œHoho,â€ I said. â€œTry telling your father that. Or Mr. Fraser. In a big city, perhaps you could get away with it. But here? Everything that happens is everybodyâ€™s business, and you know it. Hiram Crombie would stone you for fornication as soon as look at you, if he found out about it.â€ Without waiting for a reply, I got to my feet.

â€œNow, then. Weâ€™ll go back to the house and see whether theyâ€™re both still alive. Mr. Fraser may have taken matters into his own hands, and solved the problem for you.â€



THE TWINS WERE STILL ALIVE, but didnâ€™t look as though they were particularly glad of the fact. They sat shoulder to shoulder in the center of Jamieâ€™s study, pressed together as though trying to reunite into a single being.

Their heads jerked toward the door in unison, looks of alarm and concern mingling with joy at seeing Lizzie. I had her by the arm, but when she saw the twins, she pulled loose and hurried to them with a small exclamation, putting an arm about each boyâ€™s neck to draw him to her bosom.

I saw that one of the boys had a fresh black eye, just beginning to puff and swell; I supposed it must be Kezzie, though I didnâ€™t know whether this was Jamieâ€™s notion of fairness, or merely a convenient means of ensuring that he could tell which twin was which while talking to them.

Mr. Wemyss was also alive, though he didnâ€™t look any more pleased about it than the Beardsleys. He was red-eyed, pale, and still slightly green about the gills, but was at least upright and reasonably sober, seated beside Jamieâ€™s table. There was a cup of chicory coffee in front of himâ€”I could smell itâ€”but it seemed so far untouched.

Lizzie knelt on the floor, still clinging to the boys, the three heads drawn together like the lobes of a clover leaf as they murmured to one another.

â€œAre ye hurt?â€ she was saying, and â€œAre ye all right?â€ they were asking, an absolute tangle of hands and arms meanwhile searching, patting, stroking, and embracing. They reminded me of nothing so much as a tenderly solicitous octopus.

I glanced at Jamie, who was viewing this behavior with a jaundiced eye. Mr. Wemyss emitted a low moan, and buried his head in his hands.

Jamie cleared his throat with a low Scottish noise of infinite menace, and the proceedings in the middle of the room stopped as though hit with some sort of paralyzing death ray. Very slowly, Lizzie turned her head to look at him, chin held high, her arms still locked protectively about the Beardsleysâ€™ necks.

â€œSit down, lass,â€ Jamie said with relative mildness, nodding toward an empty stool.

Lizzie rose, and turned, her eyes still fixed on him. She made no move to take the offered stool, though. Instead, she walked deliberately round behind the twins and stood between them, putting her hands upon their shoulders.

â€œIâ€™ll stand, sir,â€ she said, her voice high and thin with fear, but filled with determination. Like clockwork, each twin reached up and grasped the hand upon his shoulder, their faces assuming similar expressions of mingled apprehension and steadfastness.

Jamie wisely decided not to make an issue of it, instead nodding to me in an offhand way. I took the stool myself, surprisingly glad to sit down.

â€œThe lads and I have been talking wiâ€™ your father,â€ he said, addressing Lizzie. â€œI take it itâ€™s true, what ye told your Da? Ye are with child, and ye dinna ken which is the father?â€

Lizzie opened her mouth, but no words came out. Instead, she bobbed her head in an awkward nod.

â€œAye. Well, then, yeâ€™ll need to be wed, and the sooner the better,â€ he said, in a matter-of-fact tone of voice. â€œThe lads couldna quite decide which of them it should be, so itâ€™s up to you, lass. Which one?â€

All six hands tightened in a flash of white knuckles. It was really quite fascinatingâ€”and I couldnâ€™t help feeling sorry for the three of them.

â€œI canâ€™t,â€ Lizzie whispered. Then she cleared her throat and tried again. â€œI canâ€™t,â€ she repeated more strongly. â€œI donâ€™tâ€”I donâ€™t want to choose. I love them both.â€

Jamie looked down at his clasped hands for a moment, lips pursing as he thought. Then he raised his head and looked at her, very levelly. I saw her draw herself upright, lips pressed together, trembling but resolute, determined to defy him.

Then, with truly diabolical timing, Jamie turned to Mr. Wemyss.

â€œJoseph?â€ he said mildly.

Mr. Wemyss had been sitting transfixed, eyes on his daughter, pale hands wrapped round his coffee cup. He didnâ€™t hesitate, though, or even blink.

â€œElizabeth,â€ he said, his voice very soft, â€œdo you love me?â€

Her facade of defiance broke like a dropped egg, tears welling from her eyes.

â€œOh, Da!â€ she said. She let go the twins and ran to her father, who stood up in time to clasp her tightly in his arms, cheek pressed to her hair. She clung to him, sobbing, and I heard a brief sigh from one of the twins, though I couldnâ€™t tell which one.

Mr. Wemyss swayed gently with her, patting and soothing her, his murmured words indistinguishable from her sobs and broken utterances.

Jamie was watching the twinsâ€”not without sympathy. Their hands were knotted together, and Kezzieâ€™s teeth were fixed in his lower lip.

Lizzie separated herself from her father, sniffling and groping vaguely for a handkerchief. I pulled one from my pocket, got up, and gave it to her. She blew her nose hard, and wiped her eyes, trying not to look at Jamie; she knew very well where the danger lay.

It was, however, a fairly small room, and Jamie was not a person who could be easily ignored, even in a large one. Unlike my surgery, the windows of the study were small and placed high in the wall, which gave the room under normal circumstances a pleasant dim coziness. At the moment, with the rain still coming down outside, a gray light filled the room and the air was chill.

â€œItâ€™s no a matter of whom ye love, now, lass,â€ Jamie said very gently. â€œNot even your father.â€ He nodded toward her stomach. â€œYeâ€™ve a child in your belly. Nothing else matters, but to do right by it. And that doesna mean painting its mother a whore, aye?â€

Her cheeks flamed, a patchy crimson.

â€œIâ€™m not a whore!â€

â€œI didna say ye were,â€ Jamie replied calmly. â€œBut others will, and it gets around what yeâ€™ve been up to, lass. Spreading your legs for two men, and married to neither of them? And now with a wean, and ye canna name its father?â€

She looked angrily away from himâ€”and saw her own father, head bowed, his own cheeks darkening in shame. She made a small, heartbroken sound, and buried her face in her hands.

The twins stirred uneasily, glancing at each other, and Jo got his feet under him to riseâ€”then caught a look of wounded reproach from Mr. Wemyss, and changed his mind.

Jamie sighed heavily and rubbed a knuckle down the bridge of his nose. He stood then, stooped to the hearth, and pulled two straws from the basket of kindling. Holding these in his fist, he held them out to the twins.

â€œShort straw weds her,â€ he said with resignation.

The twins gaped at him, open-mouthed. Then Kezzie swallowed visibly, closed his eyes, and plucked a straw, gingerly, as though it might be attached to something explosive. Jo kept his eyes open, but didnâ€™t look at the straw heâ€™d drawn; his eyes were fixed on Lizzie.

Everyone seemed to exhale at once, looking at the straws.

â€œVerra well, then. Stand up,â€ Jamie said to Kezzie, who held the short one. Looking dazed, he did so.

â€œTake her hand,â€ Jamie told him patiently. â€œNow, dâ€™ye swear before these witnessesâ€â€”he nodded at me and Mr. Wemyssâ€”â€œthat ye take Elizabeth Wemyss as your wife?â€

Kezzie nodded, then cleared his throat and drew himself up.

â€œI do, so,â€ he said firmly.

â€œAnd do you, ye wee besom, accept Keziahâ€”ye are Keziah?â€ he asked, squinting dubiously at the twin. â€œAye, all right, Keziah. Yeâ€™ll take him as your husband?â€

â€œAye,â€ Lizzie said, sounding hopelessly confused.

â€œGood,â€ Jamie said briskly. â€œYouâ€™re handfast. Directly we find a priest, weâ€™ll have it properly blessed, but yeâ€™re married.â€ He looked at Jo, who had risen to his feet.

â€œAnd you,â€ he said firmly, â€œyeâ€™ll leave. Tonight. Yeâ€™ll not come back â€™til the child is born.â€

Jo was white to the lips, but nodded. He had both hands pressed to his bodyâ€”not where Jamie had hit him, but higher, over his heart. I felt a sharp answering pain in the same place, seeing his face.

â€œWell, then.â€ Jamie took a deep breath, his shoulders slumping a little. â€œJosephâ€”have ye still got the marriage contract ye drew for your daughter and young McGillivray? Fetch it out, aye, and weâ€™ll change the name.â€

Looking like a snail poking its head out after a thunderstorm, Mr. Wemyss nodded cautiously. He looked at Lizzie, still standing hand-in-hand with her new bridegroom, the two of them resembling Lot and Mrs. Lot, respectively. Mr. Wemyss patted her softly on the shoulder, and hurried out, his feet tapping on the stairs.

â€œYouâ€™ll need a fresh candle, wonâ€™t you?â€ I said to Jamie, tilting my head meaningfully toward Lizzie and the twins. The stub in his candlestick had half an inch to go, but I thought it only decent to give them a few moments of privacy.

â€œOh? Oh, aye,â€ he said, catching my meaning. He coughed. â€œIâ€™ll, ah, come and get it.â€

The moment we entered my surgery, he closed the door, leaned against it, and let his head fall, shaking it.

â€œOh, God,â€ he said.

â€œPoor things,â€ I said, with some sympathy. â€œI meanâ€”you do have to feel sorry for them.â€

â€œI do?â€ He sniffed at his shirt, which had dried but still had a distinct stain of vomit down the front, then straightened up, stretching â€™til his back creaked. â€œAye, I suppose I do,â€ he admitted. â€œButâ€”oh, God! Did she tell ye how it happened?â€

â€œYes. Iâ€™ll tell you the gory details later.â€ I heard Mr. Wemyssâ€™s feet coming down the stairs. I took down a fresh pair of candles from the array that hung near the ceiling and held them out, stretching the long wick that joined them. â€œDo you have a knife handy?â€

His hand went automatically to his waist, but he wasnâ€™t wearing his dirk.

â€œNo. Thereâ€™s a penknife on my desk, though.â€

He opened the door just as Mr. Wemyss reached the office. Mr. Wemyssâ€™s exclamation of shock reached me simultaneously with the smell of blood.

Jamie pushed Mr. Wemyss unceremoniously aside, and I rushed in after him, heart in my throat.

The three of them were standing by the desk, close together. A spray of fresh blood stained the desk, and Kezzie was holding my bloodied handkerchief wrapped round his hand. He looked up at Jamie, his face ghostly in the guttering light. His teeth were gritted tight together, but he managed a smile.

A small movement caught my eye, and I saw Jo, carefully holding the blade of Jamieâ€™s penknife over the candle flame. Acting as though no one was there, he took his brotherâ€™s hand, pulled off the handkerchief, and pressed the hot metal against the raw oval of the wound on Kezzieâ€™s thumb.

Mr. Wemyss made a small choking noise, and the smell of seared flesh mixed with the scent of rain. Kezzie drew breath deeply, then let it out, and smiled crookedly at Jo.

â€œGodspeed, Brother,â€ he said, his voice a little loud and flat.

â€œMuch happiness to you, Brother,â€ Jo saidâ€”in the same voice.

Lizzie stood between them, small and disheveled, her reddened eyes fixed on Jamie. And smiled.

SO ROMANTIC




BRIANNA DROVE THE LITTLE CAR slowly up the slope of the quilt over Rogerâ€™s leg, across his stomach, and into the center of his chest, where he captured both the car and her hand, giving her a wry grin.

â€œThatâ€™s a really good car,â€ she said, pulling her hand loose and rolling comfortably onto her side beside him. â€œAll four wheels turn. What kind is it? A Morris Minor, like that little orange thing you had in Scotland? That was the cutest thing I ever saw, but I never understood how you managed to squeeze into it.â€

â€œWith talcum powder,â€ he assured her. He lifted the toy and set a front wheel spinning with a flick of his thumb. â€œAye, it is a good one, isnâ€™t it? It isnâ€™t really meant to be a particular model, but I suppose I was remembering that Ford Mustang of yours. Remember driving down out of the mountains that time?â€ His eyes softened with memory, the green of them nearly black in the dim light of the banked fire.

â€œI do. I nearly drove off the road when you kissed me at eighty-five miles per hour.â€

She moved closer to him by reflex, nudging him with a knee. He rolled obligingly to face her, and kissed her again, meanwhile running the car swiftly backward down the length of her spine and over the curve of her buttocks. She yelped and squirmed against him, trying to escape the tickling wheels, then punched him in the ribs.

â€œCut that out!â€

â€œI thought ye found speed erotic. Vroom,â€ he murmured, steering the toy up her armâ€”and suddenly down the neck of her shift. She grabbed for the car, but he snatched it away, then plunged his hand under the covers, running the wheels down her thighâ€”then madly up again.

A furious wrestling match for possession of the car ensued, which ended with both of them on the floor in a tangle of bedding and nightclothes, gasping for breath and helpless with giggling.

â€œSsh! Youâ€™ll wake up Jemmy!â€ She heaved and wriggled, trying to get out from under Rogerâ€™s weight. Secure in his fifty poundsâ€™ advantage, he merely relaxed on top of her, pinning her to the floor.

â€œYou couldnâ€™t wake him with cannon fire,â€ Roger said, with a certainty born of experience. It was true; once past the stage of waking to be fed every few hours, Jem had always slept like a particularly comatose log.

She subsided, puffing hair out of her eyes and biding her time.

â€œDo you think youâ€™ll ever go anywhere at eighty-five miles per hour again?â€

â€œOnly if I fall off the edge of a very deep gorge. Yeâ€™re naked, did ye know that?â€

â€œWell, so are you!â€

â€œAye, but I started out that way. Whereâ€™s the car?â€

â€œI have no idea,â€ she lied. It was, in fact, under the small of her back, and very uncomfortable, but she wasnâ€™t about to give him any further advantages. â€œWhat do you want it for?â€

â€œOh, I was going to explore the terrain a bit,â€ he said, raising himself on one elbow and walking his fingers slowly across the upper slope of one breast. â€œI suppose I could do it on foot, though. Takes more time, but ye do enjoy the scenery more. They say.â€

â€œMmm.â€ He could hold her down with his weight, but couldnâ€™t restrain her arms. She extended one index finger, and placed the nail of it precisely on his nipple, making him breathe in deeply. â€œDid you have a long journey in mind?â€ She glanced at the small shelf near the bed, where she kept her contraceptive materials.

â€œLong enough.â€ He followed her glance, then looked back to meet her eyes, a question in his own.

She wriggled to make herself more comfortable, unobtrusively dislodging the miniature car.

â€œThey say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,â€ she said, and raising her head, put her mouth on his nipple, and closed her teeth gently. A moment later, she let go.

â€œBe quiet,â€ she said reproachfully. â€œYouâ€™ll wake up Jemmy.â€



â€œWHERE ARE YOUR SCISSORS? Iâ€™m cutting it off.â€

â€œIâ€™m not telling you. I like it long.â€ She pushed the soft dark hair back from his face and kissed the end of his nose, which appeared to disconcert him slightly. He smiled, though, and kissed her briefly back before sitting up, swiping the hair out of his face with one hand.

â€œThat canâ€™t be comfortable,â€ he said, eyeing the cradle. â€œSurely I should move him to his own bed?â€

Brianna glanced up at the cradle from her position on the floor. Jemmy, aged four, had long since graduated to a trundle bed, but now and then insisted upon sleeping in his cradle for old timesâ€™ sake, wedging himself stubbornly into it, despite the fact that he couldnâ€™t get all four limbs and his head inside at once. He was invisible at the moment, save for two chubby bare legs sticking straight up in the air at one end.

He was getting so big, she thought. He couldnâ€™t quite read yet, but knew all his letters, and could count to a hundred and write his name. And he knew how to load a gun; his grandfather had taught him.

â€œDo we tell him?â€ she asked suddenly. â€œAnd if so, when?â€

Roger must have been thinking something along the same lines, for he appeared to understand exactly what she meant.

â€œChrist, how do you tell a kid something like that?â€ he said. He rose and picked up a handful of bedding, shaking it in apparent hopes of finding the leather string with which he bound his hair.

â€œWouldnâ€™t you tell a kid if he were adopted?â€ she objected, sitting up and running both hands through her own bountiful hair. â€œOr if thereâ€™s some family scandal, like his fatherâ€™s not dead, heâ€™s in prison? If you tell them early, it doesnâ€™t mean all that much to them, I donâ€™t think; theyâ€™re comfortable with it as they get older. If they find out later, itâ€™s a shock.â€

He gave her a wry, sidelong look. â€œYouâ€™d know.â€

â€œSo would you.â€ She spoke dryly, but she felt the echo of it, even now. Disbelief, anger, denialâ€”and then the sudden collapse of her world as she began, against her will, to believe. The sense of hollowness and abandonmentâ€”and the sense of black rage and betrayal at discovering how much of what she had taken for granted was a lie.

â€œAt least for you, it wasnâ€™t a choice,â€ she said, squirming into a more comfortable position against the edge of the bed. â€œNobody knew about you; nobody could have told you what you wereâ€”but didnâ€™t.â€

â€œOh, and ye think they should have told you about the time travel early on? Your parents?â€ He lifted one black brow, cynically amused. â€œI can see the notes coming home from your schoolâ€”Brianna has a most creative imagination, but should be encouraged to recognize situations where it is not appropriate to employ it.â€

â€œHa.â€ She kicked away the remaining tangle of clothes and bedding. â€œI went to a Catholic school. The nuns would have called it lying, and put a stop to it, period. Whereâ€™s my shift?â€ She had wriggled completely out of it in the struggle, and while she was still warm from their struggle, she felt uncomfortably exposed, even in the dim shadows of the room.

â€œHere it is.â€ He plucked a wad of linen from the mess and shook it out. â€œDo you?â€ he repeated, looking up at her with one brow raised.

â€œThink they should have told me? Yes. And no,â€ she admitted reluctantly. She reached for the shift and pulled it over her head. â€œI meanâ€”I see why they didnâ€™t. Daddy didnâ€™t believe it, to start with. And what he did believe . . . well, whatever it was, he did ask Mama to let me think he was my real father. She gave him her word; I guess I donâ€™t think she should have broken it, no.â€ To the best of her knowledge, her mother had broken her word only onceâ€”unwillingly, but to staggering effect.

She smoothed the worn linen over her body and fished for the ends of the drawstring that gathered the neck. She was covered now, but felt just as much exposed as if she were still naked. Roger was sitting on the mattress, methodically shaking out the blankets, but his eyes were still fixed on her, green and questioning.

â€œIt was still a lie,â€ she burst out. â€œI had a right to know!â€

He nodded slowly.

â€œMmphm.â€ He picked up a rope of twisted sheet and began unwinding it. â€œAye, well. I can see telling a kid heâ€™s adopted or his dadâ€™s in prison. This is maybe more along the lines of telling a kid his father murdered his mother when he found her screwing the postie and six good friends in the kitchen, though. Maybe it doesnâ€™t mean that much to him if you tell him early onâ€”but itâ€™s definitely going to get the attention of his friends when he starts telling them.â€

She bit her lip, feeling unexpectedly cross and prickly. She hadnâ€™t thought her own feelings were still so near the surface, and didnâ€™t like either the fact that they wereâ€”or that Roger could see that they were.

â€œWell . . . yes.â€ She glanced at the cradle. Jem had moved; he was curled up like a hedgehog now, with his face pressed to his knees, and nothing visible save the curve of his bottom under his nightshirt, rising over the edge of the cradle like the moon rising above the horizon. â€œYouâ€™re right. Weâ€™d have to wait until heâ€™s old enough to realize that he canâ€™t tell people; that itâ€™s a secret.â€

The leather thong fell out of a shaken quilt. He bent to pick it up, dark hair falling round his face.

â€œWould ye want to tell Jem someday that Iâ€™m not his real father?â€ he asked quietly, not looking at her.

â€œRoger!â€ All her crossness disappeared in a flood of panic. â€œI wouldnâ€™t do that in a hundred million years! Even if I thought it was true,â€ she added hastily, â€œand I donâ€™t. Roger, I donâ€™t! I know youâ€™re his father.â€ She sat down beside him, gripping his arm urgently. He smiled, a little crookedly, and patted her handâ€”but he wouldnâ€™t meet her eyes. He waited a moment, then moved, gently disengaging himself in order to tie up his hair.

â€œWhat ye said, though. Has he not got a right to know who he is?â€

â€œThatâ€™s notâ€”itâ€™s different.â€ It was; and yet it wasnâ€™t. The act that had resulted in her own conception hadnâ€™t been rapeâ€”but it had been just as unintended. On the other hand, there had been no doubt, either: bothâ€”well, all threeâ€”of her parents had known that she was Jamie Fraserâ€™s child, beyond doubt.

With Jem . . . she looked again at the cradle, instinctively wanting to find some stamp, some undeniable clue to his paternity. But he looked like her, and like her father, in terms both of coloring and feature. He was big for his age, long-limbed and broad-backedâ€”but so were both of the men who might have fathered him. And both, damn them, had green eyes.

â€œIâ€™m not telling him that,â€ she said firmly. â€œNot ever, and neither are you. You are his father, in any way that matters. And there wouldnâ€™t be any good reason for him to even know that Stephen Bonnet exists.â€

â€œSave that he does exist,â€ Roger pointed out. â€œAnd he thinks the wean is his. What if they should meet someday? When Jemâ€™s older, I mean.â€

She had not grown up with the habit of crossing herself at moments of stress as her father and cousin didâ€”but she did it now, making him laugh.

â€œI am not being funny,â€ she said, sitting up straight. â€œItâ€™s not happening. And if it didâ€”if I ever saw Stephen Bonnet anywhere near my child, Iâ€™d . . . well, next time, Iâ€™ll aim higher, thatâ€™s all.â€

â€œYeâ€™re determined to give the lad a good story for his classmates, arenâ€™t you?â€ He spoke lightly, teasing, and she relaxed a little, hoping that she had succeeded in easing any doubt he might have about what she might tell Jemmy regarding his paternity.

â€œOkay, but he does have to know the rest, sooner or later. I donâ€™t want him to find out by accident.â€

â€œYou didna find out by accident. Your mother did tell you.â€ And look where we are now. That bit went unspoken, but rang loud inside her head, as he gave her a long, straight look.

If she hadnâ€™t felt compelled to come back, go through the stones to find her real fatherâ€”none of them would be here now. Theyâ€™d be safe in the twentieth century, perhaps in Scotland, perhaps in Americaâ€”but in a place where children didnâ€™t die of diarrhea and sudden fevers.

In a place where sudden danger didnâ€™t lurk behind every tree and war wasnâ€™t hiding under the bushes. A place where Rogerâ€™s voice still sang pure and strong.

But maybeâ€”just maybeâ€”she wouldnâ€™t have Jem.

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ she said, feeling choked. â€œI know itâ€™s my faultâ€”all of it. If I hadnâ€™t come back . . .â€ She reached out, tentatively, and touched the ragged scar that circled his throat. He caught her hand and pulled it down.

â€œChrist,â€ he said softly, â€œif I could have gone anywhere to find either of my parentsâ€”including hellâ€”Brianna, I would have done it.â€ He looked up, his eyes bright green, and squeezed her hand hard. â€œIf thereâ€™s anyone in this world who understands that, hen, itâ€™s me.â€

She squeezed back with both hands, hard. Relief that he didnâ€™t blame her loosened the cords of her body, but sorrow for his own lossesâ€”and hersâ€”still filled throat and chest, heavy as wet feathers, and it hurt to breathe.

Jemmy stirred, rose suddenly upright, then fell back, still sound asleep, so that one arm flopped out of the cradle, limp as a noodle. Sheâ€™d frozen at his sudden movement, but now relaxed and rose to try to tuck the arm back in. Before she could reach the cradle, though, a knock came at the door.

Roger grabbed hastily for his shirt with one hand, his knife with the other.

â€œWho is it?â€ she called, heart thumping. People didnâ€™t pay calls after dark, save in emergency.

â€œItâ€™s me, Miss Bree,â€ said Lizzieâ€™s voice through the wood. â€œCan we come in, please?â€ She sounded excited, but not alarmed. Brianna waited to be sure that Roger was decently covered, then lifted the heavy bolt.

Her first thought was that Lizzie looked excited, too; the little bondmaidâ€™s cheeks were flushed as apples, the color visible even in the darkness of the stoop.

â€œWeâ€ was herself and the two Beardsleys, who bowed and nodded, murmuring apologies for the lateness of the hour.

â€œNot at all,â€ Brianna said automatically, glancing around for a shawl. Not only was her linen shift thin and ratty, it had an incriminating stain on the front. â€œEr, come in!â€

Roger came forward to greet the unexpected guests, magnificently disregarding the fact that he was wearing nothing but a shirt, and she scuttled hastily into the dark corner behind her loom, groping for the ancient shawl she kept there as comfort for her legs while working.

Safely wrapped in this, she kicked a log to break the fire, and stooped to light a candle from the fiery coals. In the wavering glow of the candlelight, she could see that the Beardsleys were dressed with unaccustomed neatness, their hair combed and firmly plaited, each with a clean shirt and a leather vest; they didnâ€™t own coats. Lizzie was dressed in her best, tooâ€”in fact, she was wearing the pale peach woolen dress they had made for her wedding.

Something was up, and it was fairly obvious what, as Lizzie buzzed earnestly into Rogerâ€™s ear.

â€œYe want me to marry you?â€ Roger said, in tones of astonishment. He glanced from one twin to the other. â€œEr . . . to whom?â€

â€œAye, sir.â€ Lizzie bobbed a respectful curtsey. â€œItâ€™s me and Jo, sir, if yeâ€™d be sae kind. Kezzieâ€™s come to be witness.â€

Roger rubbed a hand over his face, looking baffled.

â€œWell . . . but . . .â€ He gave Brianna a pleading look.

â€œAre you in trouble, Lizzie?â€ Brianna asked directly, lighting a second candle and putting it in the sconce by the door. With more light, she could see that Lizzieâ€™s eyelids were reddened and swollen, as though she had been cryingâ€”though her attitude was one of excited determination, rather than fear.

â€œNot to say trouble, exactly. But Iâ€”Iâ€™m wiâ€™ child, aye.â€ Lizzie crossed her hands on her belly, protective. â€œWeâ€”we wanted to be marrit, before I tell anyone.â€

â€œOh. Well . . .â€ Roger gave Jo a disapproving look, but appeared no more than half-convinced. â€œBut your fatherâ€”wonâ€™t heâ€”â€

â€œDa would want us to be marrit by a priest,â€ Lizzie explained earnestly. â€œAnd so we will be. But ye ken, sir, itâ€™ll be monthsâ€”maybe yearsâ€”before we can find one.â€ She cast down her eyes, blushing. â€œIâ€”I should like to be marrit, with proper words, ken, before the babe comes.â€

â€œYes,â€ he said, eyes drawn ineluctably to Lizzieâ€™s midsection. â€œI grasp that. But I dinna quite understand the rush, if ye take my meaning. I mean, ye wonâ€™t be noticeably more pregnant tomorrow than ye are tonight. Or next week.â€

Jo and Kezzie exchanged glances over Lizzieâ€™s head. Then Jo put his hand on Lizzieâ€™s waist and drew her gently to him.

â€œSir. Itâ€™s onlyâ€”we want to do right by each other. But weâ€™d like it to be private, see? Just me and Lizzie, and my brother.â€

â€œJust us,â€ Kezzie echoed, drawing close. He looked earnestly at Roger. â€œPlease, sir?â€ He seemed to have injured his hand somehow; there was a handkerchief wound round it.

Brianna found the three of them touching almost beyond bearing; they were so innocent, and so young, the three scrubbed faces turned earnestly up to Roger in supplication. She moved closer and touched Rogerâ€™s arm, warm through the cloth of his sleeve.

â€œDo it for them,â€ she said softly. â€œPlease? Itâ€™s not a marriage, exactlyâ€”but you can make them handfastâ€

â€œAye, well, but they ought to be counseled . . . her father . . .â€ His protests trailed off as he glanced from her toward the trio, and she could see that he was as much touched by their innocence as she was. And, she thought, privately amused, he was also very much drawn by the thought of performing his first wedding, unorthodox as it might be. The circumstances would be romantic and memorable, here in the quiet of the night, vows exchanged by the light of fire and candle, with the memory of their own lovemaking warm in the shadows and the sleeping child a silent witness, both blessing and promise for the new marriage to be made.

Roger sighed deeply, then smiled at her in resignation, and turned away.

â€œAye, all right, then. Let me put my breeches on, though; Iâ€™m not conducting my first wedding bare-arsed.â€



ROGER HELD A SPOON of marmalade over his slice of toast, staring at me.

â€œThey what?â€ he said, in a strangled tone.

â€œOh, she didnâ€™t!â€ Bree clapped a hand to her mouth, eyes wide above it, removing it at once to ask, â€œBoth of them?â€

â€œEvidently so,â€ I said, suppressing a most disgraceful urge to laugh. â€œYou really married her to Jo last night?â€

â€œGod help me, I did,â€ Roger muttered. Looking thoroughly rattled, he put the spoon in his coffee cup and stirred mechanically. â€œBut sheâ€™s handfast with Kezzie, too?â€

â€œBefore witnesses,â€ I assured him, with a wary glance at Mr. Wemyss, who was sitting across the breakfast table, mouth open and apparently turned to stone.

â€œDo you thinkâ€”â€ Bree said to me, â€œI meanâ€”both of them at once?â€

â€œEr, she said not,â€ I replied, cutting my eyes toward Mr. Wemyss as an indication that perhaps this was not a suitable question to be considering in his presence, fascinating as it was.

â€œOh, God,â€ Mr. Wemyss said, in a voice from the sepulchre. â€œShe is damned.â€

â€œHoly Mary, Mother of God.â€ Mrs. Bug, saucer-eyed, crossed herself. â€œMay Christ have mercy!â€

Roger took a gulp of his coffee, choked, and put it down, spluttering. Brianna pounded him helpfully on the back, but he motioned her away, eyes watering, and pulled himself together.

â€œNow, itâ€™s maybe not so bad as it seems,â€ he said to Mr. Wemyss, trying to find a bright side to look on. â€œI mean, one could maybe make a case that the twins are one soul that Godâ€™s put into two bodies for purposes of His own.â€

â€œAye, butâ€”two bodies!â€ Mrs. Bug said. â€œDo ye thinkâ€”both at once?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I said, giving up. â€œBut I imagineâ€”â€ I glanced at the window, where the snow whispered at the closed shutter. It had begun to snow heavily the night before, a thick, wet snow; by now, there was nearly a foot of it on the ground, and I was reasonably sure that everyone at the table was imagining exactly what I was: a vision of Lizzie and the Beardsley twins, tucked up cozily in a warm bed of furs by a blazing fire, enjoying their honeymoon.

â€œWell, I donâ€™t suppose thereâ€™s actually much anybody can do about it,â€ Bree said practically. â€œIf we say anything in public, the Presbyterians will probably stone Lizzie as a Papist whore, andâ€”â€

Mr. Wemyss made a sound like a stepped-on pigâ€™s bladder.

â€œCertainly no one will say anything.â€ Roger fixed Mrs. Bug with a hard look. â€œWill they?â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™ll have to tell Arch, mind, or Iâ€™ll burst,â€ she said frankly. â€œBut no one else. Silent as the grave, I swear it, deâ€™il take me if I lie.â€ She put both hands over her mouth in illustration, and Roger nodded.

â€œI suppose,â€ he said dubiously, â€œthat the marriage I performed isna actually valid as such. But thenâ€”â€

â€œItâ€™s certainly as valid as the handfasting Jamie did,â€ I said. â€œAnd besides, I think itâ€™s too late to force her to choose. Once Kezzieâ€™s thumb heals, no one will be able to tell . . .â€

â€œExcept Lizzie, probably,â€ Bree said. She licked a smear of honey from the corner of her mouth, regarding Roger thoughtfully. â€œI wonder what it would be like if there were two of you?â€

â€œWeâ€™d both of us be thoroughly bamboozled,â€ he assured her. â€œMrs. Bugâ€”is there any more coffee?â€

â€œWhoâ€™s bamboozled?â€ The kitchen door opened in a swirl of snow and frigid air, and Jamie came in with Jem, both fresh from a visit to the privy, ruddy-faced, their hair and lashes thick with melting snowflakes.

â€œYou, for one. Youâ€™ve just been done in the eye by a nineteen-year-old bigamist,â€ I informed him.

â€œWhatâ€™s a bigamiss?â€ Jem inquired.

â€œA very large young lady,â€ Roger said, taking a piece of buttered toast and thrusting it into Jemâ€™s mouth. â€œHere. Why donâ€™t ye take that, and . . .â€ His voice died away as he realized that he couldnâ€™t send Jem outside.

â€œLizzie and the twins came round to Rogerâ€™s last night, and he married her to Jo,â€ I told Jamie. He blinked, water from the melting snow on his lashes running down his face.

â€œI will be damned,â€ he said. He took a long breath, then realized he was still covered with snow, and went to shake himself at the hearth, bits of snow falling into the fire with a sputter and hiss.

â€œWell,â€ he said, coming back to the table and sitting down beside me, â€œat least your grandson will have a name, Joseph. Itâ€™s Beardsley, either way.â€

This ridiculous observation seemed actually to comfort Mr. Wemyss a bit; a small bit of color came back to his cheeks, and he allowed Mrs. Bug to put a fresh bannock on his plate.

â€œAye, I suppose thatâ€™s something,â€ he said. â€œAnd I really cannot seeâ€”â€

â€œCome look,â€ Jemmy was saying, tugging impatiently on Breeâ€™s arm. â€œCome see, Mama!â€

â€œSee what?â€

â€œI wrote my name! Grandda showed me!â€

â€œOh, you did? Well, good for you!â€ Brianna beamed at him, then her brow furrowed. â€œWhatâ€”just now?â€

â€œYes! Come see afore itâ€™s covered up!â€

She looked at Jamie under lowered brows.

â€œDa, you didnâ€™t.â€

He took a piece of fresh toast from the platter, and spread it neatly with butter.

â€œAye, well,â€ he said, â€œthereâ€™s got to be some advantage still to being a man, even if no one pays a bit of heed to what ye say. Will ye pass the marmalade, Roger Mac?â€

LICE




JEM PUT HIS ELBOWS on the table, chin on his fists, following the path of the spoon through the batter with the intent expression of a lion watching an appetizing wildebeest on its way to the water hole.

â€œDonâ€™t even think about it,â€ I said, with a glance at his grubby fingers. â€œTheyâ€™ll be done in a few minutes; you can have one then.â€

â€œBut I like â€™em raw, Grandma,â€ he protested. He widened his dark-blue eyes in wordless pleading.

â€œYou oughtnâ€™t to eat raw things,â€ I said sternly. â€œThey can make you sick.â€

â€œYou do, Grandma.â€ He poked a finger at my mouth, where a smudge of brownish batter remained. I cleared my throat and wiped the incriminating evidence on a towel.

â€œYouâ€™ll spoil your supper,â€ I said, but with the acuity of any jungle beast, he sensed the weakening of his prey.

â€œPromise I wonâ€™t. Iâ€™ll eat everything!â€ he said, already reaching for the spoon.

â€œYes, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m afraid of,â€ I said, relinquishing it with some reluctance. â€œJust a taste, nowâ€”leave some for your daddy and grandda.â€

He nodded, wordless, and licked the spoon with a long, slow swipe of the tongue, closing his eyes in ecstasy.

I found another spoon and set about dropping the cookies onto the tin sheets I used for baking. We ended in a dead heat, the sheets full and the bowl quite empty, just as footsteps came down the hallway toward the door. Recognizing Briannaâ€™s tread, I snatched the empty spoon from Jemmy and rubbed a quick towel across his smudgy mouth.

Bree stopped in the doorway, her smile turning to a look of suspicion.

â€œWhat are you guys doing?â€

â€œMaking molasses cookies,â€ I said, lifting the sheets in evidence, before sliding them into the brick oven set in the wall of the fireplace. â€œJemmyâ€™s been helping me.â€

One neat red brow arched upward. She glanced from me to Jemmy, who was wearing a look of sublimely unnatural innocence. I gathered my own expression was no more convincing.

â€œSo I see,â€ she said dryly. â€œHow much batter did you eat, Jem?â€

â€œWho, me?â€ Jemmy said, eyes going wide.

â€œMmm.â€ She leaned forward, and picked a speck out of his wavy red hair. â€œWhatâ€™s this, then?â€

He frowned at it, crossing his eyes slightly in the attempt to focus.

â€œA real big louse?â€ he suggested brightly. â€œReckon I got it from Rabbie McLeod.â€

â€œRabbie McLeod?â€ I said, uneasily aware that Rabbie had been curled up on the kitchen settle a few days ago, his unruly black curls flowing into Jemmyâ€™s bright locks as the boys slept, waiting for their fathers. I recalled thinking at the time how charming the little boys looked, curled up head to head, their faces soft with dreaming.

â€œHas Rabbie got lice?â€ Bree demanded, flicking the bit of batter away from her as though it were indeed a loathsome insect.

â€œOh, aye, heâ€™s crawlinâ€™,â€ Jemmy assured her cheerfully. â€œHis Mam says sheâ€™s gonna get his daddyâ€™s razor and shave off ever bit of his hair, him and his brothers and his daddy and his uncle Rufe too. She says they got lice hoppinâ€™ all over their bed. Sheâ€™s tired of beinâ€™ ate up alive.â€ Quite casually, he lifted a hand to his head and scratched, fingers raking through his hair in a characteristic gesture I had seen all too often before.

Bree and I exchanged a brief look of horror, then she seized Jemmy by the shoulders, dragging him over to the window.

â€œCome here!â€

Sure enough. Exposed to the brilliant light bouncing off the snow, the tender skin behind his ears and on the back of his neck showed the characteristic pinkness caused by scratching for lice, and a quick inspection of his head revealed the worst: tiny nits clinging to the base of the hairs, and a few reddish-brown adult lice, half the size of rice grains, who scrambled madly away into the thickets. Bree caught one and cracked it between her thumbnails, tossing the remains into the fire.

â€œEugh!â€ She rubbed her hands on her skirt, then pulled off the ribbon that tied back her hair, scratching vigorously. â€œHave I got them?â€ she asked anxiously, thrusting the crown of her head toward me.

I ruffled quickly through the thick mass of auburn and cinnamon, looking for the telltale whitish nits, then stepped back, bending my own head.

â€œNo, have I?â€

The backdoor opened, and Jamie stepped in, looking only mildly surprised to find Brianna picking through my hair like a crazed baboon. Then his head jerked up, sniffing the air.

â€œIs something burning?â€

â€œI got â€™em, Grandda!â€

The exclamation reached me together with the scent of singeing molasses. I jerked upright and banged my head on the edge of the dish shelf, hard enough to make me see stars.

These cleared just in time for me to see Jemmy, standing on tiptoe as he reached into the smoking oven in the wall of the hearth, well over his head. His eyes were squinched shut with concentration, his face turned away from the waves of heat coming off the brick, and he had a towel wound clumsily round the groping hand.

Jamie reached the boy with two strides, jerking him back by the collar. He reached into the oven bare-handed and yanked out a tin sheet of smoking cookies, flinging the hot sheet away with such force that it struck the wall. Small brown disks flew off and scattered over the floor.

Adso, who had been perched in the window, helping with the louse hunt, saw what looked like prey and pounced fiercely on a fleeing cookie, which promptly burned his paws. Uttering a startled yowl, he dropped it and raced under the settle.

Jamie, shaking his scorched fingers and making extremely vulgar remarks in Gaelic, had seized a stick of kindling in his other hand and was poking into the oven, trying to extract the remaining cookie-sheet amid clouds of smoke.

â€œWhatâ€™s goingâ€”hey!â€

â€œJemmy!â€

Rogerâ€™s cry coincided with Breeâ€™s. Coming in on Jamieâ€™s heels, Rogerâ€™s expression of bewilderment had changed at once to alarm at sight of his offspring crouched on the floor, industriously collecting cookies, and oblivious of the fact that his trailing towel was smoldering in the ashes of the cookfire.

Roger lunged for Jemmy, colliding with Bree on the same course. The two of them cannoned into Jamie, who had just maneuvered the second sheet of cookies to the edge of the oven. He reeled, staggering off balance, and the sheet clanged into the hearth, scattering lumps of smoking, molasses-scented charcoal. The cauldron, knocked askew, swung and shifted perilously on its hook, splashing soup into the coals and sending up clouds of hissing, savory steam.

I didnâ€™t know whether to laugh or run out of the door, but settled for snatching up the towel, which had burst into flames, and beating it out on the stone-flagged hearth.

I stood up, panting, to find that my family had now managed to extricate itself from the fireplace. Roger had a squirming Jemmy in a death grip against his chest, while Bree frisked the child for burns, flames, and broken bones. Jamie, looking rather annoyed, was sucking on a blistered finger, waving smoke away from his face with his free hand.

â€œCold water,â€ I said, addressing the most immediate exigency. I grasped Jamie by the arm, pulled the finger out of his mouth, and stabbed it into the washbowl.

â€œIs Jemmy all right?â€ I asked, turning to the Happy Families tableau by the window. â€œYes, I see he is. Do put him down, Roger, the child has lice.â€

Roger dropped Jemmy like a hot potato, andâ€”in the usual adult reaction to hearing the word â€œliceâ€â€”scratched himself. Jemmy, unaffected by the recent commotion, sat down on the floor and began to eat one of the cookies he had kept clutched in his hand throughout.

â€œYouâ€™ll spoil yourâ€”â€ Brianna began automatically, then caught sight of the spilled cauldron and the puddled hearth, glanced at me, and shrugged. â€œGot any more cookies?â€ she asked Jemmy. Mouth full, he nodded, reached into his shirt, and handed her one. She viewed it critically, but took a bite anyway.

â€œNot bad,â€ she said, through crumbs. â€œHm?â€ She held the remnant out to Roger, who wolfed it one-handed, using the other to poke through Jemmyâ€™s hair.

â€œItâ€™s going round,â€ he said. â€œAt least, we saw half a dozen lads near Sinclairâ€™s, all shaved like convicts. Shall we have to shave your head, then?â€ he asked, smiling at Jemmy and ruffling the boyâ€™s hair.

The boyâ€™s face lighted up at the suggestion.

â€œWill I be bald like Grandma?â€

â€œYes, even balder,â€ I assured him tartly. I had in fact got a good two-inch crop at the moment, though the curliness made it look shorter, little waves and swirls hugging the curves of my skull.

â€œShave his head?â€ Brianna looked aghast. She turned to me. â€œIsnâ€™t there any other good way to get rid of lice?â€

I looked consideringly at Jemmyâ€™s head. He had the same thick, slightly wavy hair as his mother and grandfather. I glanced at Jamie, who grinned at me, one hand in the washbowl. He knew from experience just how long it took to nit-comb that sort of hair; Iâ€™d done it for him many times. He shook his head.

â€œShave him,â€ he said. â€œYeâ€™ll not get a lad that size to sit still long enough to comb.â€

â€œWe could use lard,â€ I suggested dubiously. â€œYou plaster his head with lard or bear grease and leave it for a few days. It suffocates the lice. Or at least you hope so.â€

â€œAck.â€ Brianna viewed her sonâ€™s head with disfavor, obviously envisioning the havoc he could wreak on clothes and linens, if allowed to roam at large while plastered with lard.

â€œVinegar and a fine-comb will get out the big ones,â€ I said, coming to peer down at the fine white line of the parting through Jemmyâ€™s ruddy hair. â€œIt doesnâ€™t get the nits, though; you have to scrape those off with your fingernailsâ€”or else wait â€™til they hatch and comb them out.â€

â€œShave him,â€ Roger said, shaking his head. â€œYe never get all the nits; you have to do it over again every few days, and if ye miss a few that grow big enough to hop . . .â€ He grinned and flicked a cookie crumb off his thumbnail; it bounced off Breeâ€™s skirt and she slapped it away, glowering at Roger.

â€œYouâ€™re a big help!â€ She bit her lip, frowning, then nodded reluctantly. â€œAll right, then, I suppose thereâ€™s no help for it.â€

â€œIt will grow back,â€ I assured her.

Jamie went upstairs to fetch his razor; I went to the surgery to get my surgical scissors and a bottle of oil of lavender for Jamieâ€™s burned finger. By the time I came back, Bree and Roger had their heads together over what looked like a newspaper.

â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ I asked, coming to peer over Briannaâ€™s shoulder.

â€œFergusâ€™s maiden effort.â€ Roger smiled up at me, and moved the paper so I could see. â€œHe sent it up with a trader who left it at Sinclairâ€™s for Jamie.â€

â€œReally? Thatâ€™s wonderful!â€

I craned my neck to see, and a small thrill went through me at sight of the bold headline across the top of the page:

THE NEW BERN UNION

Then I looked closer.

â€œOnion?â€ I said, blinking. â€œThe Onion?â€

â€œWell, he explains that,â€ Roger said, pointing to an ornately embellished Remarks by the Proprietor in the center of the page, the legend upheld by a couple of floating cherubim. â€œItâ€™s to do with onions having layersâ€”complexity, you seeâ€”and the . . . erâ€â€”his finger ran down the lineâ€”â€œthe Pungency and Savor of the Reasoned Discourse always to be exercised herein for the compleat Information and Amusement of our Purchasers and Readers.â€

â€œI notice he makes a distinction between purchasers and readers,â€ I remarked. â€œVery French of him!â€

â€œWell, yes,â€ Roger agreed. â€œThereâ€™s a distinctly Gallic tone to some of the pieces, but you can see that Marsali must have had a hand in itâ€”and, of course, most of the advertisements were written by the people who placed them.â€ He pointed to one small item, headed, Lost, a hat. If found in good condition, please return to the subscriber, S. Gowdy, New Bern. If not in good condition, wear it yourself.

Jamie arrived with his razor in time to hear this, and joined in the laughter. He poked a finger down the page, at another item.

â€œAye, thatâ€™s good, but I think the â€˜Poetâ€™s Cornerâ€™ is maybe my favorite. Fergus couldna have done it, I dinna think; heâ€™s no ear for rhyme at allâ€”was it Marsali, dâ€™ye think, or someone else?â€

â€œRead it out loud,â€ Brianna said, reluctantly relinquishing the paper to Roger. â€œIâ€™d better clip Jemmy before he gets away and spreads lice all over Fraserâ€™s Ridge.â€

Once resigned to the prospect, Brianna didnâ€™t hesitate, but tied a dishcloth round Jemmyâ€™s neck and set to with the scissors in a determined fashion that sent strands of red-gold and auburn falling to the floor like shimmering rain. Meanwhile, Roger read out, with dramatic flourishes,

â€œOn the late Act against retailing

Spirituous Liquors, etc.â€”

Tell meâ€”can it be understood,

This Act intends the Publick Good?

No truly; I deny it:

For if, as all allow, â€™tis best,

Of Evils Two, to chose the least,

Then my Opinionâ€™s right.

Suppose on Searchâ€”it should appear,

Ten Bunters dyâ€™d in every yearâ€”

â€œâ€”By drinking to Excess

Should thousands innocent be led

Into Despair, and lose their Bread,

Such folly to redress?

Iâ€™d not be thought tâ€™encourage sin,

Or be an Advocate of Gin;

But humbly do conceive,

This scheme, thoâ€™ drawn with nicest care

Donâ€™t with Almighty Justice square

If Scriptures we believe

When Sodomâ€™s Sin for Vengeance callâ€™d

Ten righteous had its Doom forestallâ€™d

And movâ€™d eâ€™en God to Pity.

But now Ten bare-facâ€™d Debauchees

Some private Epicures displease,

And ruin half a City.â€

â€œIâ€™d not be thought tâ€™encourage sin/Or be an Advocate of Gin,â€ Bree repeated, giggling. â€œYou notice heâ€”or sheâ€”doesnâ€™t mention whisky. Whatâ€™s a Bunter, though? Oops, hold still, baby!â€

â€œA harlot,â€ Jamie said absently, stropping his razor while still reading over Rogerâ€™s shoulder.

â€œWhatâ€™s a harlot?â€ Jemmy asked, his radar naturally picking up the single indelicate word in the conversation. â€œIs it Richieâ€™s sister?â€

Richard Woolamâ€™s sister Charlotte was a most attractive young person; she was also a most devout Quaker. Jamie exchanged glances with Roger, and coughed.

â€œNo, I shouldna think it, lad,â€ he said. â€œAnd for Godâ€™s sake, donâ€™t say so, either! Here, are ye ready to be shaved?â€ Not waiting for an answer, he picked up the shaving brush and lathered Jemmyâ€™s polled head, to the accompaniment of delighted squeals.

â€œBarber, barber, shave a pig,â€ Bree said, watching. â€œHow many hairs to make a wig?â€

â€œLots,â€ I replied, sweeping up the drifts of fallen hair and throwing them into the fire, hopefully to the destruction of all resident lice. It was rather a pity; Jemmyâ€™s hair was beautiful. Still, it would grow againâ€”and the clipping showed off the lovely shape of his head, roundly pleasing as a cantaloupe.

Jamie hummed tunelessly under his breath, drawing the razor over the skin of his grandsonâ€™s head with as much delicacy as if he had been shaving a honeybee.

Jemmy turned his head slightly, and I caught my breath, struck by a fleeting memoryâ€”Jamie, his hair clipped short against his skull in Paris, readying himself to meet Jack Randall; readying himself to killâ€”or be killed. Then Jemmy turned again, squirming on his stool, and the vision vanishedâ€”to be replaced by something else.

â€œWhatever is that?â€ I leaned forward to look, as Jamie drew his razor down with a flourish and flicked away the last dollop of lather into the fire.

â€œWhat?â€ Bree leaned in beside me, and her eyes widened at sight of the small brown blotch. It was about the size of a farthing, quite round, just above the hairline toward the back of his head, behind the left ear.

â€œWhat is it?â€ she asked, frowning. She touched it gently, but Jemmy scarcely noticed; he was squirming even more, wanting to get down.

â€œIâ€™m fairly sure itâ€™s all right,â€ I assured her, after a quick inspection. â€œIt looks like whatâ€™s called a nevusâ€”itâ€™s something like a flat mole, usually quite harmless.â€

â€œBut where did it come from? He wasnâ€™t born with it, I know!â€ she protested.

â€œBabies very seldom have any sort of mole,â€ I explained, untying my dishcloth from round Jemmyâ€™s neck. â€œAll right, yes, youâ€™re done! Go and be good nowâ€”weâ€™ll have supper as soon as I can manage. No,â€ I added, turning back to Bree, â€œmoles usually start to develop around three years of ageâ€”though of course people can get more as they grow older.â€

Freed from restraint, Jemmy was rubbing his naked head with both hands, looking pleased and chanting, â€œChar-lotte the Har-lot, Char-lotte the Har-lot,â€ quietly under his breath.

â€œYouâ€™re sure itâ€™s all right?â€ Brianna was still frowning, worried. â€œIt isnâ€™t dangerous?â€

â€œOh, aye, itâ€™s nothing,â€ Roger assured her, glancing up from the newspaper. â€œIâ€™ve had one just like that myself, ever since I was a kid. Just . . . here.â€ His face changed abruptly as he spoke, and his hand rose, very slowly, to rest on the back of his headâ€”just above the hairline, behind the left ear.

He looked at me, and I saw his throat move as he swallowed, the jagged rope scar dark against the sudden paleness of his skin. The down hairs rose silently on my arms.

â€œYes,â€ I said, answering the look, and hoping my voice didnâ€™t shake too noticeably. â€œThat sort of mark is . . . often hereditary.â€

Jamie said nothing, but his hand closed on mine, squeezing tight.

Jemmy was on his hands and knees now, trying to coax Adso out from under the settle. His neck was small and fragile, and his shaven head looked unearthly white and shockingly naked, like a mushroom poking out of the earth. Rogerâ€™s eyes rested on it for a moment; then he turned to Bree.

â€œI do believe perhaps Iâ€™ve picked up a few lice myself,â€ he said, his voice just a tiny bit too loud. He reached up, pulled off the thong that bound his thick black hair, and scratched his head vigorously with both hands. Then he picked up the scissors, smiling, and held them out to her. â€œLike father, like son, I suppose. Give us a hand here, aye?â€

DANGEROUS

CORRESPONDENCE




From Mount Josiah Plantation in the Colony of Virginia,

Lord John Grey to Mr. James Fraser, Esq.,

Fraserâ€™s Ridge, North Carolina,

upon the Sixth of March, Anno Domini 1775

Dear Mr. Fraserâ€”

What in the Name of God are you about? I have known you in the course of our long Acquaintance to be many Thingsâ€”Intemperate and Stubborn being two of themâ€”but have always known you for a Man of Intelligence and Honor.

Yet despite explicit Warnings, I find your Name upon more than one List of suspected Traitors and Seditionists, associated with illegal Assemblies, and thus subject to Arrest. The Fact that you are still at Liberty, my Friend, reflects nothing more than the Lack of Troops at present available in North Carolinaâ€”and that may change rapidly. Josiah Martin has implored London for Help, and it will be forthcoming, I assure you.

Was Gage not more than sufficiently occupied in Boston, and Lord Dunsmoreâ€™s Virginia troops still in process of Assembly, the Army would be upon you within a few Months. Do not delude yourself; the King may be misguided in his Actions, but the Government perceivesâ€”if belatedlyâ€”the Level of Turmoil in the Colonies, and is moving as rapidly as may be to suppress it, before greater Harm can ensue.

Whatever else you may be, you are no Fool, and so I must assume you realize the Consequences of your Actions. But I would be less than a Friend did I not put the Case to you bluntly: you expose your Family to the utmost Danger by your Actions, and you put your own Head in a Noose.

For the Sake of whatever Affection you may yet bear me, and for the Sake of those dear Connexions between your Family and myselfâ€”I beg you to renounce these most dangerous Associations while there is still Time.





John

I read the letter through, then looked up at Jamie. He was sitting at his desk, papers strewn in every direction, scattered with the small brown fragments of broken sealing wax. Bobby Higgins had brought a good many letters, newspapers, and packagesâ€”Jamie had put off reading Lord Johnâ€™s letter â€™til the last.

â€œHeâ€™s very much afraid for you,â€ I said, putting the single sheet of paper down on top of the rest.

Jamie nodded.

â€œFor a man of his parts to refer to the Kingâ€™s actions as possibly â€˜misguidedâ€™ is verra close to treason, Sassenach,â€ he observed, though I thought he was joking.

â€œThese lists he mentionsâ€”do you know anything about that?â€

He shrugged at that, and poked through one of the untidy piles with a forefinger, pulling out a smeared sheet that had obviously been dropped in a puddle at some point.

â€œLike that, I suppose,â€ he said, handing it over. It was unsigned, and nearly illegible, a misspelt and vicious denunciation of various Outrages and Debached Personsâ€”here listedâ€”whose speech, action, and appearance was a threat to all who valued peace and prosperity. These, the writer felt, should be shown whats what, presumably by being beaten, skinned alive, rold in bolling Tar and placâ€™d on a Rail, or in particularly pernicious cases, Hanged outright from there own Rooftrees.

â€œWhere did you pick that up?â€ I dropped it on the desk, using two fingers.

â€œIn Campbelton. Someone sent it to Farquard, as Justice of the Peace. He gave it to me, because my name is on it.â€

â€œIt is?â€ I squinted at the straggling letters. â€œOh, so it is. J. Frayzer. Youâ€™re sure itâ€™s you? There are quite a few Frasers, after all, and not a few named John, James, Jacob, or Joseph.â€

â€œRelatively few who could be described as a Red-haired dejenerate Pox-ridden Usuring Son of a Bitch who skulks in Brothels when not drunk and comitting Riot in the Street, I imagine.â€

â€œOh, I missed that part.â€

â€œItâ€™s in the exposition at the bottom.â€ He gave the paper a brief, indifferent glance. â€œI think Buchan the butcher wrote it, myself.â€

â€œAlways assuming that â€˜usuringâ€™ is a word, I donâ€™t see where he gets that bit; you havenâ€™t any money to lend.â€

â€œI wouldna suppose a basis in truth is strictly required, under the circumstances, Sassenach,â€ he said very dryly. â€œAnd thanks to MacDonald and wee Bobby, there are a good many folk who think I do have moneyâ€”and if I am not inclined to lend it to them, why then, plainly itâ€™s a matter of my having put my fortune all in the hands of Jews and Whig speculators, as I am intent upon ruining trade for my own profit.â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œThat was a somewhat more literary effort,â€ he said, shuffling through the pile and pulling out an elegant parchment sheet, done in a copperplate hand. This one had been sent to a newspaper in Hillsboro, and was signed, A Friend to Justice; and while it didnâ€™t name Jamie, it was clear who the subject of the denunciation was.

â€œItâ€™s the hair,â€ I said, looking critically at him. â€œIf you wore a wig, theyâ€™d have a much harder time of it.â€

He lifted one shoulder in a sardonic shrug. The commonly held view of red hair as an indicator of low character and moral coarseness, if not outright demonic possession, was by no means limited to anonymous ill-wishers. The knowledge of that viewâ€”together with personal disinclinationâ€”had quite a bit to do with the fact that he never did wear either wig or powder, even in situations where a proper gentleman would.

Without asking, I reached for a stack of the papers and began to leaf through them. He made no move to stop me, but sat quietly watching, listening to the thrum of the rain.

A heavy spring storm was washing down outside, and the air was cold and damp, thick with the green scents of the forest insinuating themselves through the crevices of door and window. I sometimes had the sudden feeling, hearing the wind coming through the trees, that the wilderness outside meant to come in, march through the house, and obliterate it, erasing all trace of us.

The letters were a mixed bag. Some were from the members of the North Carolina Committee of Correspondence, with bits of news, most of it from the north. Continental Association Committees had sprung up in New Hampshire and New Jersey, these bodies now beginning to virtually take over the functions of government, as the royal governors lost their grip on assemblies, courts, and Customs, the remnants of organization falling ever deeper into disarray.

Boston was still occupied by Gageâ€™s troops, and some of the letters continued the appeals for food and supplies to be sent to the succor of her citizensâ€”we had sent two hundredweight of barley during the winter, which one of the Woolams had undertaken to get into the city, along with three wagonloads of other foodstuffs contributed by the inhabitants of the Ridge.

Jamie had picked up his quill, and was writing something, slowly, to accommodate the stiffness of his hand.

Next up was a note from Daniel Putnam, circulated through Massachusetts, noting the rising of militia companies in the countryside, and asking for arms and powder. It was signed by a dozen other men, each one bearing witness to the truth of the situation in his own township.

A Second Continental Congress was proposed, to meet in Philadelphia, the date yet undecided.

Georgia had formed a Provincial Congress, but as the Loyalist letter-writerâ€”plainly assuming Jamie to be like-mindedâ€”triumphantly noted, There is no Sense of Grievance toward Great Britain here, as elsewhere; Loyalist Sentiment is so strong that only five Parishes of twelve have sent anyone to this upstart and illegal Congress.

A much-bedraggled copy of the Massachusetts Gazette, dated February 6, containing a letter, circled in ink and titled The Rule of Law and the Rule of Men. It was signed Novanglusâ€”which I took to be a sort of hog-Latin for â€œnew Englishmanâ€â€”and to be a response to previous letters by a Tory who signed himself Massachusettensis, of all things.

I had no idea who Massachusettensis might be, but I recognized a few phrases from Novanglusâ€™s letter, from long-ago bits of Breeâ€™s schoolworkâ€”John Adams, in good form.

â€œA government of laws, not of men,â€ I murmured. â€œWhat sort of pen name would you use, if you were going to write this sort of thing?â€ Glancing up, I caught sight of him, looking sheepish to a degree.

â€œYouâ€™ve been doing it already?â€

â€œWell, just the odd bittie letter here or there,â€ he said defensively. â€œNo pamphlets.â€

â€œWho are you?â€

He shrugged, deprecating.

â€œScotus Americanus, but only â€™til I think of something better. There are a few others using that name, that I ken.â€

â€œWell, thatâ€™s something. The King will have a harder time picking you out of the crowd.â€ Muttering â€œMassachusettensisâ€ to myself, I picked up the next document.

A note from John Stuart, much affronted by Jamieâ€™s abrupt resignation, noting that the most illegal and prodigal Congress, as they call it of Massachusetts had formally invited the Stockbridge Indians to enlist in the service of the colony, and informing Jamie that should any of the Cherokee follow suit, he, John Stuart, would take the greatest pleasure in personally ensuring that he, Jamie Fraser, was hanged for treason.

â€œAnd I donâ€™t suppose John Stuart even knows you have red hair,â€ I observed, laying it aside. I felt a trifle shaky, in spite of my attempts to joke about it. Seeing it all laid out in black and white solidified the clouds that had been gathering round us, and I felt the first chilling drop of icy rain on my skin, despite the woolen shawl around my shoulders.

There was no hearth in the study; only a small brazier that we used for heat. It was burning now in the corner, and Jamie rose, picked up a stack of letters, and began to feed them to the fire, one by one.

I had a sudden rush of dÃ©jÃ  vu, and saw him standing by the hearth in the drawing room of his cousin Jaredâ€™s house in Paris, feeding letters to the fire. The stolen letters of Jacobite conspirators, rising in white puffs of smoke, the gathering clouds of a storm long past.

I remembered what Fergus had said, in answer to Jamieâ€™s instructions: â€œI remember how this game is played.â€ So did I, and spicules of ice began to form in my blood.

Jamie dropped the last flaming fragment into the brazier, then sanded the page he had been writing, shook the sand off, and handed it to me. He had used one of the sheets of the special paper Bree had made by pressing a digested pulp of rags and plant matter between silk screens. It was thicker than the usual, with a soft, glossy texture, and she had mixed berries and tiny leaves into the pulp, so that here and there a small red stain spread like blood beneath the shadow of a leafâ€™s silhouette.

From Fraserâ€™s Ridge, in the Colony of North Carolina,

this 16th day of March, Anno Domini 1775,

James Fraser to Lord John Grey, of Mount Josiah Plantation,

in the Colony of Virginia

My dear Johnâ€”

It is too late.

Our continued Correspondence cannot but prove a Danger to you, but it is with the greatest Regret that I sever this Link between us.

Believe me ever





Your most humble and affectionate Friend,





Jamie

I read it in silence, and handed it back. As he poked about in search of the sealing wax, I noticed a small wrapped parcel on the corner of his desk that had been hidden by the drifts of paper.

â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€ I picked it up; it was amazingly heavy for its size.

â€œA present from his Lordship, for wee Jemmy.â€ He lit the beeswax taper from the brazier and held it over the seam of the folded letter. â€œA set of lead soldiers, Bobby says.â€

THE EIGHTEENTH OF APRIL




ROGER CAME AWAKE QUITE SUDDENLY , with no notion what had wakened him. It was full dark, but the air had the still, inward feel of the small hours; the world holding its breath, before dawn comes on a rising wind.

He turned his head on the pillow and saw that Brianna was awake, too; she lay looking upward, and he caught the brief flicker of her eyelids as she blinked.

He moved a hand to touch her, and hers closed over it. An adjuration to silence? He lay very still, listening, but heard nothing. An ember broke in the hearth with a muffled crack and her hand tightened. Jemmy flung himself over in bed with a rustle of quilts, let out a small yelp, and fell silent. The night was undisturbed.

â€œWhat is it?â€ he said, low-voiced.

She didnâ€™t turn to look at him; her eyes were fixed now on the window, a dark gray rectangle, barely visible.

â€œYesterday was the eighteenth of April,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s here.â€ Her voice was calm, but there was something in it that made him move closer, so they lay side by side, touching from shoulder to foot.

Somewhere to the north of them, men were gathering in the cold spring night. Eight hundred British troops, groaning and cursing as they dressed by candlelight. Those who had gone to bed rousing to the beat of the drum passing by the houses and warehouses and churches where they quartered, those who hadnâ€™t, stumbling from dice and drink, the warm hearths of taverns, the warm arms of women, hunting lost boots and seizing weapons, turning out by twos and threes and fours, clanking and mumbling through the streets of frozen mud to the muster point.

â€œI grew up in Boston,â€ she said, her voice softly conversational. â€œEvery kid in Boston learned that poem, somewhere along the line. I learned it in fifth grade.â€

â€œListen, my children, and you shall hear/Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.â€ Roger smiled, envisioning her in the uniform of Saint Finbarâ€™s parochial school, blue overall jumper, white blouse, and knee socks. Heâ€™d seen her fifth-grade school photograph once; she looked like a small, fierce, disheveled tiger that some maniac had dressed in dollâ€™s clothes.

â€œThatâ€™s the one. On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five/Hardly a man is now alive/Who remembers that famous day and year.â€

â€œHardly a man,â€ Roger echoed softly. Someoneâ€”who? A householder, eavesdropping on the British commanders quartered in his house? A barmaid, bringing mugs of pokered hot rum to a couple of sergeants? There was no keeping of secrets, not with eight hundred men on the move. It was all a matter of time. Someone had sent word from the occupied city, word that the British meant to seize the stored arms and powder in Concord, and at the same time, arrest Hancock and Samuel Adamsâ€”the founder of the Committee of Safety, the inflammatory speaker, the leaders of this treasonous rebellionâ€”reported to be in Lexington.

Eight hundred men to capture two? Good odds. And a silversmith and his friends, alarmed at the news, had set out into that cold night. Bree continued:

â€œHe said to his friend, â€˜If the British march

By land or sea from the town tonight,

Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch

Of the North Church tower as a signal lightâ€”

One if by land, and two if by sea;

And I on the opposite shore will be,

Ready to ride and spread the alarm

Through every Middlesex village and farm,

For the country folk to be up and to arm.â€™â€

â€œThey donâ€™t write poems like that anymore,â€ Roger said. But in spite of his cynicism, he couldnâ€™t bloody help seeing it: the steam of a horseâ€™s breath, white in darkness, and across the black water, the tiny star of a lantern, high above the sleeping town. And then another.

â€œWhat happened next?â€ he said.

â€œThen he said â€˜Good-night!â€™ and with muffled oar

Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,

Just as the moon rose over the bay,

Where swinging wide at her moorings lay

The Somerset, British man-of-war;

A phantom ship, with each mast and spar

Across the moon like a prison bar,

And a huge black hulk, that was magnified

By its own reflection in the tide.â€

â€œWell, thatâ€™s not too bad,â€ he said judiciously. â€œI like the bit about the Somerset. Rather a painterly description.â€

â€œShut up.â€ She kicked him, though without real violence. â€œIt goes on about his friend, who wanders and watches, with eager earsâ€”â€ Roger snorted, and she kicked him again. â€œTill in the silence around him he hears/The muster of men at the barrack door/The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet/And the measured tread of the grenadiers/Marching down to their boats on the shore.â€

He had visited her in Boston in the spring. In mid-April, the trees would have no more than a haze of green, their branches still mostly bare against pale skies. The nights were still frigid, but the cold was somehow touched with life, a freshness moving through the icy air.

â€œThen thereâ€™s a boring part about the friend climbing the stairs of the church tower, but I like the next verse.â€ Her voice, already soft, dropped a little, whispering.

â€œBeneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,

In their night encampment on the hill,

Wrapped in silence so deep and still

That he could hear, like a sentinelâ€™s tread,

The watchful night-wind, as it went

Creeping along from tent to tent,

And seeming to whisper, â€˜All is well!â€™

A moment only he feels the spell

Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread

Of the lonely belfry and the dead;

For suddenly all his thoughts are bent

On a shadowy something far away,

Where the river widens to meet the bayâ€”

A line of black that bends and floats

On the rising tide like a bridge of boats.â€

â€œThen thereâ€™s a lot of stuff with old Paul killing time waiting for the signal,â€ she said, abandoning the dramatic whisper for a more normal tone of voice. â€œBut it finally shows up, and then . . .

â€œA hurry of hoofs in a village street,

A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,

And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark

Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;

That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,

The fate of a nation was riding that night;

And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,

Kindled the land into flame with its heat.â€

â€œThatâ€™s actually pretty good.â€ His hand curved over her thigh, just above the knee, in case she might kick him again, but she didnâ€™t. â€œDo you remember the rest?â€

â€œSo he goes along by the Mystic River,â€ Brianna said, ignoring him, â€œand then there are three verses, as he passes through the townships:

â€œIt was twelve by the village clock

When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.

He heard the crowing of the cock,

â€œAnd the barking of the farmerâ€™s dog,

And felt the damp of the river fog,

That rises after the sun goes down.

â€œIt was one by the village clock,

When he galloped into Lexington.

He saw the gilded weathercock

Swim in the moonlight as he passed,

And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,

Gaze at him with a spectral glare,

As if they already stood aghast

At the bloody work they would look upon.

â€œIt was two by the village clockâ€”and yes, I hear the clock chiming in the first lines, be quiet!â€ He had in fact drawn breath, but not to interrupt, only because heâ€™d suddenly realized heâ€™d been holding it. â€œIt was two by the village clock,â€ she repeated,

â€œWhen he came to the bridge in Concord town.

He heard the bleating of the flock,

And the twitter of birds among the trees,

And felt the breath of the morning breeze

Blowing over the meadow brown.

And one was safe and asleep in his bed

Who at the bridge would be first to fall,

Who that day would be lying dead,

Pierced by a British musket ball.

â€œYou know the rest.â€ She stopped abruptly, her hand tight on his.

From one moment to the next, the character of the night had changed. The stillness of the small hours had ceased, and a breath of wind moved through the trees outside. All of a sudden, the night was alive again, but dying now, rushing toward dawn.

If not actively twittering, the birds were wakeful; something called, over and over, in the nearby wood, high and sweet. And above the stale, heavy scent of the fire, he breathed the wild clean air of morning, and felt his heart beat with sudden urgency.

â€œTell me the rest,â€ he whispered.

He saw the shadows of men in the trees, the stealthy knocking on doors, the low-voiced, excited conferencesâ€”and all the while, the light growing in the east. The lap of water and creak of oars, the sound of restless kine lowing to be milked, and on the rising breeze the smell of men, stale with sleep and empty of food, harsh with black powder and the scent of steel.

And without thinking, pulled his hand from his wifeâ€™s grasp, rolled over her, and pulling up the shift from her thighs, took her hard and fast, in vicarious sharing of that mindless urge to spawn that attended the imminent presence of death.

Lay on her trembling, the sweat drying on his back in the breeze from the window, heart thumping in his ears. For the one, he thought. The one who would be the first to fall. The poor sod who maybe hadnâ€™t swived his wife in the dark and taken the chance to leave her with child, because he had no notion what was coming with the dawn. This dawn.

Brianna lay still under him; he could feel the rise and fall of her breath, powerful ribs that lifted even under his weight.

â€œYou know the rest,â€ she whispered.

â€œBree,â€ he said very softly. â€œI would sell my soul to be there now.â€

â€œShh,â€ she said, but her hand rose, and settled on his back in what might be benediction. They lay still, watching the light grow by degrees, keeping silence.



THIS SILENCE WAS broken a quarter of an hour later, by the sound of rushing footsteps and a pounding at the door. Jemmy popped out of his blankets like a cuckoo from a clock, eyes round, and Roger heaved himself up, hurriedly brushing down his nightshirt.

It was one of the Beardsleys, face pinched and white in the gray light. He paid no attention to Roger, but cried out to Brianna, â€œLizzieâ€™s having the baby, come quick!â€, before dashing off in the direction of the Big House, where the figure of his brother could be seen gesticulating wildly on the porch.

Brianna flung on her clothes and burst out of the cabin, leaving Roger to deal with Jemmy. She met her mother, similarly disheveled but with a neatly packed medical kit slung over her shoulder, hurrying toward the narrow path that led past spring house and stable, into the distant woods where the Beardsleysâ€™ cabin lay.

â€œShe should have come down last week,â€ Claire gasped. â€œI told her . . .â€

â€œSo did I. She said . . .â€ Brianna gave up the attempt to speak. The Beardsley twins had long outdistanced them, sprinting through the wood like deer, whooping and yellingâ€”whether from sheer excitement at their impending fatherhood, or to let Lizzie know help was on the way, she couldnâ€™t tell.

Claire had worried about Lizzieâ€™s malaria, she knew. And yet the yellow shadow that so often hung over her erstwhile bondmaid had all but disappeared during her pregnancy; Lizzie bloomed.

Nonetheless, Brianna felt her stomach clench in fear as they came into sight of the Beardsleysâ€™ cabin. The hides had been moved outside, stacked round the tiny house like a barricade, and the smell of them gave her a momentâ€™s terrible vision of the MacNeillsâ€™ cabin, filled with death.

The door hung open, though, and there were no flies. She forced herself to hang back an instant, to let Claire go in first, but hurried in on her heelsâ€”to find that they were too late.

Lizzie sat up in a blood-smeared bower of furs, blinking with amazed stupefaction at a small, round, blood-smeared baby, who was regarding her with the exact same expression of open-mouthed astonishment.

Jo and Kezzie were clutching each other, too excited and afraid to speak. From the corner of her eye, Brianna saw their mouths opening and closing in syncopation, and wanted to laugh, but instead followed her mother to the bedside.

â€œHe just popped out!â€ Lizzie was saying, glancing momentarily at Claire, but then jerking her fascinated gaze back to the baby, as though she expected himâ€”yes, it was a him, Brianna sawâ€”to disappear as suddenly as he had arrived.

â€œMy back hurt something dreadful, all last night, so I couldna sleep, and the lads took it in turns to rub me, but it didna really help, and then when I got up to go to the privy this morning, all the water burst forth from betwixt my legsâ€”just as ye said it would, maâ€™am!â€ she said to Claire. â€œAnd so I said to Jo and Kezzie they must run fetch ye, but I didna ken quite what to do next. So I set about to mix up batter for to make hoecake for breakfastâ€â€”she waved at the table, where a bowl of flour sat with a jug of milk and two eggsâ€”â€œand next thing, I had this terrible urge toâ€”toâ€”â€ She blushed, a deep, becoming peony color.

â€œWell, I couldna even reach the chamber-pot. I just squatted there by the table, andâ€”andâ€”pop! There he was, right on the ground beneath me!â€

Claire had picked the new arrival up, and was cooing reassurances to him, while deftly checking whatever it was one checked about new babies. Lizzie had made a blanket in preparation, carefully knitted of lambâ€™s wool, dyed with indigo. Claire glanced at the pristine blanket, then pulled a length of stained, soft flannel from her kit. Wrapping the baby in it, she handed him to Brianna.

â€œHold him a moment while I deal with the cord, will you, darling?â€ she said, pulling scissors and thread from her kit. â€œThen you can clean him off a bitâ€”thereâ€™s a bottle of oil in hereâ€”while I take care of Lizzie. And you lot,â€ she added, glancing sternly at the Beardsleys, â€œgo outside.â€

The baby moved suddenly inside his wrappings, startling Brianna with the sudden vivid recollection of tiny, solid limbs pushing from inside: a kick to the liver, the liquid swell and shift as head or buttocks pressed up in a hard, smooth curve beneath her ribs.

â€œHallo, little guy,â€ she said softly, cuddling him against her shoulder. He smelled strongly and strangely of the sea, she thought, and oddly fresh against the acrid pungency of the hides outside.

â€œOoh!â€ Lizzie gave a startled squeal, as Claire kneaded her belly, and there was a juicy, slithering sort of sound. Brianna remembered that vividly, too; the placenta, that liverish, slippery afterthought of birth, almost soothing as it passed over the much-abused tissues with a sense of peaceful completion. All over, and the stunned mind began to comprehend survival.

There was a gasp from the doorway, and she looked up to see the Beardsleys, side by side and saucer-eyed.

â€œShoo!â€ she said firmly, and flipped a hand at them. They promptly disappeared, leaving her to the entertaining task of cleaning and oiling the flailing limbs and creased body. He was a small baby, but round: round-faced, very round-eyed for a newbornâ€”he hadnâ€™t cried at all, but was plainly awake and alertâ€”and with a round little belly, from which the stump of his umbilical cord protruded, dark purple and fresh.

His look of astonishment had not faded; he goggled up at her, solemn as a fish, though she could feel the huge smile on her own face.

â€œYou are so cute!â€ she told him. He smacked his lips in a thoughtful sort of way, and crinkled his brow.

â€œHeâ€™s hungry!â€ she called over her shoulder. â€œAre you ready?â€

â€œReady?â€ Lizzie croaked. â€œMother of God, how can ye be ready for something like this?â€, which made Claire and Brianna both laugh like loons.

Nonetheless, Lizzie reached for the little blue-wrapped bundle and put it uncertainly to her breast. There was a certain amount of fumbling and increasingly anxious grunts from the baby, but at last a suitable connection was established, making Lizzie utter a brief shriek of surprise, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

At this point, Brianna became aware that there had been conversation going on outside for some timeâ€”a mutter of male voices, deliberately pitched low, in a confusion of speculation and puzzlement.

â€œI imagine you can let them in now. Then put the griddle in the fire, if you would.â€ Claire, beaming fondly at mother and child, was mixing the neglected batter.

Brianna poked her head out of the cabin door, to find Jo, Kezzie, her own father, Roger, and Jemmy, clustered in a knot a little distance away. They all glanced up when they saw her, with expressions ranging from vaguely shamefaced pride to simple excitement.

â€œMama! Is the baby here?â€ Jem rushed up, pushing to get past her into the cabin, and she grabbed him by the collar.

â€œYes. You can come see him, but you have to be quiet. Heâ€™s very new, and you donâ€™t want to scare him, all right?â€

â€œHim?â€ one of the Beardsleys asked, excited. â€œItâ€™s a boy?â€

â€œI told ye so!â€ his brother said, nudging him in the ribs. â€œI said I saw a wee prick!â€

â€œYou donâ€™t say things like â€˜prickâ€™ in front of ladies,â€ Jem informed him severely, turning to frown at him. â€œAnd Mama says be quiet!â€

â€œOh,â€ said the Beardsley twin, abashed. â€œOh, aye, to be sure.â€

Moving with an exaggerated caution that made her want to laugh, the twins tiptoed into the cabin, followed by Jem, Jamieâ€™s hand firm on his shoulder, and Roger.

â€œIs Lizzie all right?â€ he asked softly, pausing to kiss her briefly in passing.

â€œA little overwhelmed, I think, but fine.â€

Lizzie was in fact sitting up, soft blond hair now combed and shining around her shoulders, glowing with happiness at Jo and Kezzie, who knelt at her bedside, grinning like apes.

â€œMay the blessing of Bride and of Columba be on you, young woman,â€ Jamie said formally in Gaelic, bowing to her, â€œand may the love of Christ sustain you always in your motherhood. May milk spring from your breasts like water from the rock and may you rest secure in the arms of yourâ€â€”he coughed briefly, glancing at the Beardsleysâ€”â€œhusband.â€

â€œIf you canâ€™t say â€˜prick,â€™ why can you say â€˜breastsâ€™?â€ Jemmy inquired, interested.

â€œYe canâ€™t, unless itâ€™s a prayer,â€ his father informed him. â€œGrandda was giving Lizzie a blessing.â€

â€œOh. Are there any prayers with pricks in them?â€

â€œIâ€™m sure there are,â€ Roger replied, carefully avoiding Briannaâ€™s eye, â€œbut ye donâ€™t say them out loud. Why donâ€™t ye go and help Grannie with the breakfast?â€

The iron griddle was sizzling with fat, and the fragrant smell of fresh batter filled the room as Claire began to pour spoonfuls onto the hot metal.

Jamie and Roger, having presented their compliments to Lizzie, had stepped back a bit, to give the little family a moment to themselvesâ€”though the cabin was so small, there was barely room for everyone to fit inside.

â€œYou are so beautiful,â€ Joâ€”or possibly Kezzieâ€”whispered, touching her hair with an awed forefinger. â€œYe look like the new moon, Lizzie.â€

â€œDid it hurt ye very much, sweetheart?â€ murmured Kezzieâ€”or maybe Joâ€”stroking the back of her hand.

â€œNot so much,â€ she said, stroking Kezzieâ€™s hand, then lifting her palm to cup Joâ€™s cheek. â€œLook. Is he no the bonniest wee creature yeâ€™ve ever seen?â€ The baby had drunk his fill and fallen asleep; he let go the nipple with an audible pop! and rolled back in his motherâ€™s arm like a dormouse, mouth a little open.

The twins made identical soft sounds of awe, and looked doe-eyed at theirâ€”well, what else could one say? Brianna thoughtâ€”their son.

â€œOh, such dear wee fingers!â€ Kezzieâ€”or Joâ€”breathed, touching the little pink fist with a dirty forefinger.

â€œIs he all there?â€ Joâ€”or Kezzieâ€”asked. â€œYeâ€™ve looked?â€

â€œI have,â€ Lizzie assured him. â€œHereâ€”dâ€™ye want to hold him?â€ Not pausing for assent, she put the bundle into his arms. Whichever twin it was looked at once thrilled and terrified, and glanced wildly at his brother for support.

Brianna, enjoying the tableau, felt Roger close behind her.

â€œArenâ€™t they sweet?â€ she whispered, reaching back for his hand.

â€œOh, aye,â€ he said, a smile in his voice. â€œEnough to make ye want another, isnâ€™t it?â€

It was an innocent remark; she could tell he had meant nothing by itâ€”but he heard the echo, even as she did, and coughed, letting go her hand.

â€œHereâ€”thatâ€™s for Lizzie.â€ Claire was handing a plate of fragrant cakes, drizzled with butter and honey, to Jem. â€œIs anyone else hungry?â€

The general stampede in response to this enabled Brianna to hide her feelings, but they were still thereâ€”and painfully clear, if still tangled.

Yes, she did want another baby, thank you, she thought fiercely at Rogerâ€™s oblivious back. In the instant of holding the newborn child, she wanted it with a yearning of flesh that surpassed hunger or thirst. And she would have loved to blame him for the fact that it hadnâ€™t happened yet.

It had taken a true leap of faith, across the vertiginous abyss of knowledge, for her to put aside her dauco seeds, those fragile pellets of protection. But sheâ€™d done it. And nothing. Lately, sheâ€™d been thinking uneasily of what Ian had told her about his wife and their struggles to conceive. True, she had suffered no miscarriage, and was profoundly grateful for that. But the part he had told her, where their lovemaking became more mechanical and desperateâ€”that was beginning to loom like a specter in the distance. It hadnâ€™t gotten that bad yetâ€”but more often than not, she turned into Rogerâ€™s arms, thinking, Now? Will it be this time? But it never was.

The twins were becoming more comfortable with their offspring, their dark heads pressed close together, tracing the chubby outlines of his sleeping features and wondering aloud who he most resembled, of all idiotic things.

Lizzie was single-mindedly devouring her second plate of hoecakes, accompanied by grilled sausages. The smell was wonderful, but Brianna wasnâ€™t hungry.

It was a good thing that they knew for sure, she told herself, watching Roger take his turn to hold the baby, his dark, lean face softening. If there had still been any doubt that Jemmy was Rogerâ€™s child, he would have blamed himself as Ian did, thought there was something wrong with him. As it was . . .

Had something happened to her? she wondered uneasily. Had Jemmyâ€™s birth damaged something?

Jamie was holding the new baby now, one big hand cradling the round little head, smiling down with that look of soft affection so peculiarâ€”and endearingâ€”to men. She did long to see that look on Rogerâ€™s face, holding his own newborn child.

â€œMr. Fraser.â€ Lizzie, filled at last with sausages, put aside her empty plate and leaned forward, looking earnestly up at Jamie. â€œMy father. Doesâ€”does he know?â€ She couldnâ€™t help glancing at the empty doorway behind him.

Jamie looked momentarily disconcerted.

â€œAh,â€ he said, and handed the baby carefully to Roger, clearly taking advantage of the pause to try to think of some less-hurtful way to phrase the truth.

â€œAye, he kens the babe was on the way,â€ he said carefully. â€œI told him.â€

And he had not come. Lizzieâ€™s lips pressed together, and a shadow of unhappiness crossed the new-moon glow of her face.

â€œHad weâ€”had Iâ€”one of usâ€”best go and tell him, sir?â€ one of the twins asked hesitantly. â€œThat the childâ€™s here, I mean, and . . . and that Lizzieâ€™s all right.â€

Jamie hesitated, clearly uncertain whether that would be a good idea or not. Mr. Wemyss, pale and ill-looking, had not referred to his daughter, his putative sons-in-law, or his theoretical grandchild since the imbroglio surrounding Lizzieâ€™s multiple weddings. Now that the grandchild was a concrete fact, though . . .

â€œWhatever he thinks he ought to do,â€ Claire said, her face slightly troubled, â€œheâ€™ll want to know that theyâ€™re all right, surely.â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ Jamie agreed. He glanced dubiously at the twins. â€œIâ€™m just no entirely sure it should be Jo or Kezzie to tell him, though.â€

The twins exchanged a long glance, in which some decision seemed to be reached.

â€œIt should, sir,â€ one of them said firmly, turning to Jamie. â€œThe babyâ€™s ourn, but itâ€™s his blood, too. Thatâ€™s a link between us; heâ€™ll know that.â€

â€œWe donâ€™t want him to be crosswise with Lizzie, sir,â€ his brother said, more soft-spoken. â€œIt hurts her. Might be the baby would . . . ease things, dâ€™ye think?â€

Jamieâ€™s face betrayed nothing other than a studied attention to the matter at hand, but Brianna saw him dart a quick glance at Roger before returning his gaze to the bundle in Rogerâ€™s arm, and she hid a smile. He had certainly not forgotten his own acrimonious first response to Roger, but it had been Rogerâ€™s claiming of Jem that had established the firstâ€”and very fragileâ€”link in the chain of acceptance that she thought now bound Roger nearly as close to Jamieâ€™s heart as she herself.

â€œAye, then,â€ Jamie said, still reluctant. He very much disliked being involved in this situation, she could tellâ€”but hadnâ€™t yet succeeded in figuring out any way of dealing with it. â€œGo and tell him. Just the one of ye, though! And should he come, tâ€™other of ye keep well out of his sight, dâ€™ye hear me?â€

â€œOh, aye, sir,â€ both of them assured him in unison. Joâ€”or Kezzieâ€”frowned a little at the bundle, and hesitantly extended his arms. â€œShould Iâ€”â€

â€œNo, donâ€™t.â€ Lizzie was sitting bolt upright, her arms braced to keep her weight off her tender nether parts. Her small fair brow was set in a frown of determination. â€œTell him weâ€™re well, aye. But if he wants to see the bairnâ€”heâ€™ll come, and welcome. But if heâ€™ll no set foot upon my threshold . . . well, then, heâ€™s no welcome to see his grandson. Tell him,â€ she repeated, easing herself back upon her pillows.

â€œNow give my bairnie to me.â€ She held out her arms, and clutched the sleeping baby to her, closing her eyes against any possibility of argument or reproach.

THE UNIVERSAL

BROTHERHOOD OF MAN




BRIANNA LIFTED THE WAXED CLOTH covering one of the big earthenware basins, and sniffed, taking pleasure in the musty, turned-earth smell. She stirred the pale mess with a stick, lifting it out periodically in order to assess the texture of the pulp that dripped from it.

Not bad. Another day, and it would be dissolved enough to press. She considered whether to add more of the dilute sulfuric acid solution, but decided against it, and instead reached into the bowl at her side, filled with the limp petals of dogwood and redbud flowers gathered for her by Jemmy and Aidan. She scattered a handful of these delicately over the grayish pulp, stirred them in, then covered the bowl again. By tomorrow, theyâ€™d be no more than faint outlines, but still visible as shadows in the finished sheets of paper.

â€œIâ€™d always heard that paper mills stank.â€ Roger made his way through the bushes toward her. â€œPerhaps they use something else in the making?â€

â€œBe glad Iâ€™m not tanning hides,â€ she advised him. â€œIan says the Indian women use dog turds for that.â€

â€œSo do European tanners; they just call the stuff â€˜pure.â€™â€

â€œPure what?â€

â€œPure dog turds, I suppose,â€ he said with a shrug. â€œHowâ€™s it going?â€

Coming up beside her, he looked with interest at her own small paper factory: a dozen big, fired-clay basins, each filled with scraps of used paper, worn-out scraps of silk and cotton, flax fibers, the soft pith of cattail reeds, and anything else she could get her hands on that might be useful, torn to shreds or ground small in a quern. Sheâ€™d dug out a small seep, and laid one of her broken water pipes as a catch basin, to provide a convenient water supply; nearby, sheâ€™d built a platform of stone and wood, on which stood the framed silk screens in which she pressed the pulp.

There was a dead moth floating in the next bowl, and he reached to take it out, but she waved him away.

â€œBugs drown in it all the time, but as long as theyâ€™re soft-bodied, itâ€™s okay. Enough sulfuric acidâ€â€”she nodded at the bottle, stoppered with a bit of ragâ€”â€œand they all just become part of the pulp: moths, butterflies, ants, gnats, lacewings . . . wings are the only things that wonâ€™t dissolve all the way. Lacewings look sort of pretty embedded in the paper, but not roaches.â€ She fished one of these out of a bowl and flicked it away into the bushes, then added a little more water from the gourd dipper, stirring.

â€œIâ€™m not surprised. I stamped on one of them this morning; he flattened out, then popped back up and strolled off, smirking.â€ He paused a moment; he wanted to ask her something, she could tell, and she made an interrogative hum to encourage him.

â€œI was only wonderingâ€”would ye mind taking Jem up to the Big House after supper? Perhaps the two of ye spending the night?â€

She looked at him in astonishment.

â€œWhat are you planning to do? Throw a stag party for Gordon Lindsay?â€ Gordon, a shy boy of about seventeen, was betrothed to a Quaker girl from Woolamâ€™s Mill; heâ€™d been round the day before to â€œthigâ€â€”beg small bits of household goods in preparation for his marriage.

â€œNo girls popping out of cakes,â€ he assured her, â€œbut itâ€™s definitely men only. Itâ€™s the first meeting of the Fraserâ€™s Ridge Lodge.â€

â€œLodge . . . what, Freemasons?â€ She squinted dubiously at him, but he nodded. The breeze had come up, and it whipped his black hair up on end; he smoothed it back with one hand.

â€œNeutral ground,â€ he explained. â€œI didna want to suggest holding meetings in either the Big House or Tom Christieâ€™s placeâ€”not wanting to favor either side, ye might say.â€

She nodded, seeing that.

â€œOkay. But why Freemasons?â€ She knew nothing whatever about Freemasons, save that they were some sort of secret society and that Catholics werenâ€™t allowed to join.

She mentioned this particular point to Roger, who laughed.

â€œTrue,â€ he said â€œThe Pope forbade it about forty years ago.â€

â€œWhy? What does the Pope have against Freemasons?â€ she asked, interested.

â€œItâ€™s rather a powerful body. A good many men of power and influence belongâ€”and it crosses international lines. I imagine the Popeâ€™s actual concern is competition in terms of power-brokingâ€”though if I recall aright, his stated reason was that Freemasonry is too much like a religion itself. Oh, that, and they worship the Devil.â€

He laughed.

â€œYe did know your father started a Lodge at Ardsmuir, in the prison there?â€

â€œMaybe he mentioned it; I donâ€™t remember.â€

â€œI did bring up the Catholic thing with him. He gave me one of those looks of his and said, â€˜Aye, well, the Pope wasna in Ardsmuir Prison, and I was.â€™â€

â€œSounds reasonable to me,â€ she said, amused. â€œBut then, Iâ€™m not the Pope. Did he say why? Da, I mean, not the Pope.â€

â€œSureâ€”as a means of uniting the Catholics and Protestants imprisoned together. One of the principles of Freemasonry being the universal brotherhood of man, aye? And another being that ye donâ€™t talk religion or politics in Lodge.â€

â€œOh, you donâ€™t? What do you do in Lodge, then?â€

â€œI canâ€™t tell you. Not worshipping the Devil, though.â€

She raised her eyebrows at him, and he shrugged.

â€œI canâ€™t,â€ he repeated. â€œWhen ye join, you take an oath not to talk outside the Lodge about whatâ€™s done there.â€

She was mildly miffed at that, but dismissed it, going back to add more water to one bowl. It looked as though someone had thrown up in it, she thought critically, and reached for the acid bottle.

â€œSounds pretty fishy to me,â€ she remarked. â€œAnd kind of silly. Isnâ€™t there something about secret handshakes, that sort of thing?â€

He merely smiled, not bothered by her tone.

â€œIâ€™m not saying there isnâ€™t a bit of stage business involved. Itâ€™s more or less medieval in origin, and itâ€™s kept quite a bit of the original trappingsâ€”rather like the Catholic Church.â€

â€œPoint taken,â€ she said dryly, picking up a ready bowl of pulp. â€œOkay. So, is it Daâ€™s idea to start a Lodge here?â€

â€œNo, mine.â€ His voice lost its humorous tone, and she looked at him sharply.

â€œI need a way to give them common ground, Bree,â€ he said. â€œThe women have itâ€”the fishersâ€™ wives sew and spin and knit and quilt wiâ€™ the others, and if they privately think you or your mother or Mrs. Bug are heretics damned to hell, or goddamned Whigs, or whatever, it seems to make no great difference. But not the men.â€

She thought of saying something about the relative intelligence and common sense of the two sexes, but feeling that this might be counterproductive just at the moment, nodded understanding. Besides, he obviously had no notion of the kind of gossip that went on in sewing circles.

â€œHold that screen steady, will you?â€

He obligingly grasped the wooden frame, pulling taut the edges of the finely drawn wire threaded through it, as instructed.

â€œSo,â€ she said, spooning the thin gruel of the pulp onto the silk, â€œdo you want me to provide milk and cookies for this affair tonight?â€

She spoke with considerable irony, and he smiled across the screen at her.

â€œThatâ€™d be nice, aye.â€

â€œI was joking!â€

â€œI wasnâ€™t.â€ He was still smiling, but with complete seriousness behind his eyes, and she realized suddenly that this wasnâ€™t a whim. With an odd small twist of the heart, she saw her father standing there.

One had known the care of other men from his earliest years, a part of the duty of his birthright; the other had come to it later, but both felt that burden to be the will of God, she had no doubt at allâ€”both accepted that duty without question, would honor it, or die in trying. She only hoped it wouldnâ€™t come to thatâ€”for either of them.

â€œGive me one of your hairs,â€ she said, looking down to hide what she felt.

â€œWhy?â€ he asked, but was plucking a strand from his head even as he spoke.

â€œThe paper. The pulp shouldnâ€™t be spread any thicker than a hair.â€ She laid the black thread at the edge of the silk screen, then spread the creamy liquid thin and thinner, so it flowed past the hair but did not cover it. It flowed with the liquid, a sinuous dark line through the white, like the tiny crack on the surface of her heart.

ALARMS




lâ€™oignonâ€“INTELLIGENCER

A MARRIAGE IS ANNOUNCED. The NEW BERN INTELLIGENCER, founded by Jno. Robinson, has ceased publication with the removal of its founder to Great Britain, but we assure its Customers that this Newspaper shall not vanish altogether, as its Premises, Stock, and Subscription Lists have been acquired by the Proprietors of THE ONION, that esteemed, popular, and Preeminent Journal. The New Periodical, Much Improved and Expanded, will henceforth appear as the Lâ€™OIGNONâ€“INTELLIGENCER, distributed upon a Weekly Basis, with Extra Editions as events demand, these provided at a modest cost of One Penny. . . .

To Mr. and Mrs. James Fraser, of the Ridge,

North Carolina, from Mr. and Mrs. Fergus Fraser,

Thorpe Street, New Bern

Dear Father and Mother Claire:

I write to acquaint you with the latest Change in our Fortunes. Mr. Robinson, who had owned the other Newspaper in the town, found himself removed to Great Britain. Literally removed, as some Persons unknown, disguised as Savages, invaded his Shop in the early Hours of the Morning, and pulled him from his Bed, hurrying him to the Harbor and there thrusting him aboard a Ship, clad only in his Nightclothes and Cap.

The Captain promptly cast off his Tethers and made Sail, leaving the Town in some Uproar, as you may imagine.

Within a Day of Mr. Robinsonâ€™s abrupt Departure, though, we were visited by two separate Parties (I cannot write their Names, being discreet as you will appreciate). One of these was a Member of the local Committee of Safetyâ€”which everyone knows was behind Mr. Robinsonâ€™s Removal, but no one says so. He was civil in his Speech, but his manner was not so much. He wished, he said, to assure himself that Fergus did not share the Willfully Wrongheaded Sentiments so oft expressed by Mr. Robinson, regarding recent Events and Particulars.

Fergus told him with a very straight face that he would not chuse to share so much as a Glass of Wine with Mr. Robinson (which he could not, Mr. Robinson being Methody and against Drink), and the Gentleman took this to mean what he wished, and went away satisfied, and gave Fergus a Purse of Money.

Next thing comes another Gentleman, fat and most Important in the Affairs of the Town, and a Member of the Royal Council, though I did not know it at the time. His Errand was the Sameâ€”or rather, the Opposite: he wished to inquire whether Fergus was inclined to acquire Mr. Robinsonâ€™s Assets, so to continue his work on behalf of the Kingâ€”that being the printing of some Letters, and the Suppression of Others.

Fergus says to this Gentleman, most grave, that he has always found Much to admire in Mr. Robinson (chiefly his horse, which is gray and very amiable, and the curious Buckles on his Shoes), but adding that we have barely Means to buy Ink and Paper, and so he feared we must resign ourselves to the Acquisition of Mr. Robinsonâ€™s Shop by a Person of no great Sensitivity in Politickal Matters.

I was myself in Terror, a State not improved when the Gentleman uttered a Laugh and took a fat Purse from his Pocket, remarking that one must not â€œspoil the ship for a happenyâ€™s worth of tar.â€ He seemed to think this most amusing, and laughed quite immoderate, then patted Henri-Christian on the Head and went away.

So our Prospects are at once enlarged and alarming. I am fair sleepless, thinking on the Future, but Fergus is so much Improved in Spirits that I cannot regret it.

Pray for us, as we pray for you always, my Dear Parents.





Your Obedient and Loving Daughter,





Marsali

â€œYou taught him well,â€ I remarked, trying to keep my voice casual.

â€œEvidently so.â€ Jamie looked slightly worried, but much more amused. â€œDinna fash yourself over it, Sassenach. Fergus has some skill at this game.â€

â€œIt is not a game,â€ I said, with enough vehemence that he looked at me in surprise.

â€œItâ€™s not,â€ I repeated, a little more calmly.

He raised his brows at me, and pulling a small sheaf of papers from the mess on his desk, handed them across.

WEDNESDAY MORNING

NEAR 10 OF THE CLOCKâ€”WATERTOWN

To all the friends of American liberty be it known that this morning before break of day, a brigade, consisting of about 1,000 to 1,200 men landed at Phipâ€™s Farm at Cambridge and marched to Lexington, where they found a company of our colony militia in arms, upon whom they fired without any provocation and killed six men and wounded four others. By an express from Boston, we find another brigade are now upon their march from Boston supposed to be about 1,000. The Bearer, Israel Bissell, is charged to alarm the country quite to Connecticut and all persons are desired to furnish him with fresh horses as they may be needed. I have spoken with several persons who have seen the dead and wounded. Pray let the delegates from this colony to Connecticut see this.





J. Palmer, one of the Committee of Safety.

They know Col. Foster of Brookfield one of the Delegates.

Beneath this message was a list of signatures, though most were done in the same handwriting. The first read A true copy taken from the original per order of the Committee of Correspondence for Worcesterâ€”April 19, 1775. Attest. Nathan Baldwin, Town Clerk. All the others were preceded by similar statements.

â€œI will be damned,â€ I said. â€œItâ€™s the Lexington Alarm.â€ I glanced up at Jamie, wide-eyed. â€œWhere did you get it?â€

â€œOne of Colonel Asheâ€™s men brought it.â€ He shuffled to the end of the last sheet, pointing out John Asheâ€™s endorsement. â€œWhat is the Lexington Alarm?â€

â€œThat.â€ I looked at it with fascination. â€œAfter the battle at Lexington, General Palmerâ€”heâ€™s a general of militiaâ€”wrote this and sent it through the countryside by an express rider, to bear witness to what had happened; to notify the militias nearby that the war had started.

â€œMen along the way took copies of it, endorsed them to swear that they were true copies, and sent the message along to other townships and villages; there were probably hundreds of copies made at the time, and quite a few survived. Frank had one that someone gave him as a present. He kept it in a frame, in the front hall of our house in Boston.â€

Then a quite extraordinary shudder went through me, as I realized that the familiar letter I was looking at had in fact been written only a week or two beforeâ€”not two hundred years.

Jamie was looking a little pale, too.

â€œThisâ€”itâ€™s what Brianna told me would happen,â€ he said, a tone of wonder in his voice. â€œUpon the nineteenth of April, a fight in Lexingtonâ€”the start of the war.â€ He looked straight at me, and I saw that his eyes were dark, with a combination of awe and excitement.

â€œI did believe ye, Sassenach,â€ he said. â€œBut . . .â€

He didnâ€™t finish the sentence, but sat down, reaching for his quill. With slow deliberation, he signed his name at the foot of the page.

â€œYeâ€™ll make me a fair copy, Sassenach?â€ he said. â€œIâ€™ll send it on.â€

THE WORLD TURNED

UPSIDE DOWN




COLONEL ASHEâ€™S MAN HAD also brought word of a congress to be held in Mecklenberg County, to take place in mid-May, with the intent to declare the countyâ€™s official independence from the King of England.

Aware of the fact that he was still viewed with skepticism by not a few leaders of what had now suddenly become â€œthe rebellion,â€ despite the stout personal support of John Ashe and a few other friends, Jamie made up his mind to attend this congress and speak openly in support of the measure.

Roger, absolutely blazing with suppressed excitement at this, his first chance to witness recorded history in the making, was to go with him.

A few days before their scheduled departure, though, everyoneâ€™s attention was distracted from the prospect of history by the more immediate present: the entire Christie family arrived suddenly at the front door, soon after breakfast.

Something had happened; Allan Christie was flushed with agitation, Tom grim and gray as an old wolf. Malva had clearly been crying, and her face went red and white by turns. I greeted her, but she looked away from me, lips trembling, as Jamie invited them into his study, gesturing them to sit.

â€œWhat is it, Tom?â€ He glanced briefly at Malvaâ€”plainly she was the focus of this family emergencyâ€”but gave his attention to Tom, as patriarch.

Tom Christieâ€™s mouth was pressed so tight that it was barely visible in the depths of his neatly clipped beard.

â€œMy daughter finds herself with child,â€ he said abruptly.

â€œOh?â€ Jamie cast another brief glance at Malvaâ€”who stood with capped head bowed, looking down at her clasped handsâ€”then looked at me with a raised eyebrow. â€œAh. Well . . . thereâ€™s a good bit of it going about, to be sure,â€ he said, and smiled kindly, in an effort to ease the Christies, all of whom were quivering like beads on a tight-pulled wire.

I was myself less than startled to hear the news, though naturally concerned. Malva had always attracted a great deal of attention from young men, and while both her brother and father had been vigilant in preventing any open courting, the only way of keeping young men away altogether would have been to lock her in a dungeon.

Who had the successful suitor been? I wondered. Obadiah Henderson? Bobby, perhaps? One of the McMurchie brothers? Notâ€”please Godâ€”both of them, I hoped. All of theseâ€”and not a few othersâ€”had been obvious in their admiration.

Tom Christie received Jamieâ€™s attempt at pleasantry with stony silence, though Allan made a poor attempt at a smile. He was nearly as pale as his sister.

Jamie coughed.

â€œWell, so. Is there some way in which I might help, then, Tom?â€

â€œShe says,â€ Christie began gruffly, with a piercing look at his daughter, â€œthat she will not name the man, save in your presence.â€ He turned the look on Jamie, thick with dislike.

â€œIn my presence?â€ Jamie coughed again, clearly embarrassed at the obvious implicationâ€”that Malva thought her male relatives would either beat her or proceed to do violence upon her lover, unless the presence of the landlord constrained them. Personally, I thought that particular fear was probably well founded, and gave Tom Christie a narrow look of my own. Had he already tried, and failed, to beat the truth out of her?

Malva was not making any attempt at divulging the name of the father of her child, Jamieâ€™s presence notwithstanding. She merely pleated her apron between her fingers, over and over, eyes fixed on her hands.

I cleared my throat delicately.

â€œHowâ€”umâ€”how far gone are you, my dear?â€

She didnâ€™t answer directly, but pressed both hands, shaking, against her apron front, smoothing down the cloth so that the round bulge of her pregnancy was suddenly visible, smooth and melonlike, surprisingly large. Six months, perhaps; I was startled. Clearly, sheâ€™d delayed telling her father for as long as she possibly couldâ€”and hidden it well.

The silence was well beyond awkward. Allan shifted uncomfortably on his stool, and leaned forward to murmur reassuringly to his sister.

â€œItâ€™ll be all right, Mallie,â€ he whispered. â€œYeâ€™ve got to say, though.â€

She took a huge gulp of air at that, and raised her head. Her eyes were reddened, but still very beautiful, and wide with apprehension.

â€œOh, sir,â€ she said, but then stopped dead.

Jamie was by now looking nearly as uncomfortable as the Christies, but did his best to keep his air of kindness.

â€œWill ye not tell me, then, lass?â€ he said, as gently as possible. â€œI promise yeâ€™ll not suffer for it.â€

Tom Christie made an irritable noise, like some beast of prey disturbed at its meal, and Malva went very pale indeed, but her eyes stayed fixed on Jamie.

â€œOh, sir,â€ she said, and her voice was small but clear as a bell, ringing with reproach. â€œOh, sir, how can ye say that to me, when ye ken the truth as well as I do?â€ Before anyone could react to that, she turned to her father, and lifting a hand, pointed directly at Jamie.

â€œIt was him,â€ she said.



I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO grateful for anything in life as for the fact that I was looking at Jamieâ€™s face when she said it. He had no warning, no chance to control his featuresâ€”and he didnâ€™t. His face showed neither anger nor fear, denial or surprise; nothing save the open-mouthed blankness of absolute incomprehension.

â€œWhat?â€ he said, and blinked, once. Then realization flooded into his face.

â€œWHAT?â€ he said, in a tone that should have knocked the little trollop flat on her lying little bottom.

She blinked then, and cast down her eyes, the very picture of virtue shamed. She turned, as though unable to bear his gaze, and stretched out a tremulous hand toward me.

â€œIâ€™m so sorry, Mrs. Fraser,â€ she whispered, tears trembling becomingly on her lashes. â€œHeâ€”weâ€”we didna mean to hurt ye.â€

I watched with interest from somewhere outside my body, as my arm lifted and drew back, and felt a sense of vague approval as my hand struck her cheek with enough force that she stumbled backward, tripped over a stool, and fell, her petticoats tumbled up to her waist in a froth of linen, wool-stockinged legs sticking absurdly up in the air.

â€œCanâ€™t say the same, Iâ€™m afraid.â€ I hadnâ€™t even thought of saying anything, and was surprised to feel the words in my mouth, cool and round as river stones.

Suddenly, I was back in my body. I felt as though my stays had tightened during my temporary absence; my ribs ached with the effort to breathe. Liquid surged in every direction; blood and lymph, sweat and tearsâ€”if I did draw breath, my skin would give way and let it all spurt out, like the contents of a ripe tomato, thrown against a wall.

I had no bones. But I had will. That alone held me upright and saw me out the door. I didnâ€™t see the corridor or realize that I had pushed open the front door of the house; all I saw was a sudden blaze of light and a blur of green in the dooryard and then I was running, running as though all the demons of hell coursed at my heels.

In fact, no one pursued me. And yet I ran, plunging off the trail and into the wood, feet sliding in the layers of slippery needles down the runnels between stones, half-falling down the slope of the hill, caroming painfully off fallen logs, wrenching free of thorns and brush.

I arrived breathless at the bottom of a hill and found myself in a dark, small hollow walled by the towering black-green of rhododendrons. I paused, gasping for breath, then sat down abruptly. I felt myself wobble, and let go, ending on my back among the dusty layers of leathery mountain laurel leaves.

A faint thought echoed in my mind, under the sound of my gasping breath. The guilty flee, where no man pursues. But I surely wasnâ€™t guilty. Nor was Jamie; I knew that. Knew it.

But Malva was certainly pregnant. Someone was guilty.

My eyes were blurred from running and the sunlight starred into fractured slabs and streaks of colorâ€”dark blue, light blue, white and gray, pinwheels of green and gold as the cloudy sky and the mountainside spun round and round above me.

I blinked hard, unshed tears sliding down my temples.

â€œBloody, bloody, fucking hell,â€ I said very softly. â€œNow what?â€



JAMIE STOOPED WITHOUT thought, seized the girl by the elbows, and hauled her unceremoniously to her feet. Her one cheek bore a crimson patch where Claire had struck her, and for an instant, he had a strong urge to give her one to match on the other side.

He hadnâ€™t the chance either to quell that desire or to execute it; a hand seized his shoulder to yank him round, and it was reflex alone that made him dodge aside as Allan Christieâ€™s fist glanced off the side of his head, catching him painfully on the tip of the ear. He pushed the young man hard in the chest with both hands, then hooked a heel behind his calf as he staggered, and Allan dropped on his backside with a thud that shook the room.

Jamie stepped back, a hand to his throbbing ear, and glared at Tom Christie, who was standing staring at him like Lotâ€™s wife.

Jamieâ€™s free left hand was clenched in a fist, and he raised it a little, in invitation. Christieâ€™s eyes narrowed further, but he made no move toward Jamie.

â€œGet up,â€ Christie said to his son. â€œAnd keep your fists to yourself. Thereâ€™s nay need for that now.â€

â€œIsnâ€™t there?â€ cried the lad, scrambling to his feet. â€œHeâ€™s made a whore of your daughter, and youâ€™ll let him stand? Well, and yeâ€™ll play coward, auld man, Iâ€™ll not!â€

He lunged at Jamie, wild-eyed, hands grabbing for his throat. Jamie stepped to the side, shifted weight back on one leg, and hooked the lad in the liver with a vicious left that drove his wame into his backbone and doubled him over with a whoof. Allan stared up at him, open-mouthed and the whites of his eyes showing all round, then subsided onto his knees with a thud, mouth opening and closing like a fishâ€™s.

It might have been comical under other circumstances, but Jamie felt no disposition to laugh. He wasted no more time on either of the men, but swung round on Malva.

â€œSo, what mischief is this yeâ€™re about, nighean na galladh?â€ he said to her. It was a serious insult, and Tom Christie knew what it meant, Gaelic or not; Jamie could see Christie stiffen, in the corner of his eye.

The girl herself was already in tears, and burst into sobs at this.

â€œHow can ye speak to me so?â€ she wailed, and clutched her apron to her face. â€œHow can ye be so cruel?â€

â€œOh, for Godâ€™s sake,â€ he said crossly. He shoved a stool in her direction. â€œSit, ye wee loon, and weâ€™ll hear the truth of whatever ye think yeâ€™re up to. Mr. Christie?â€ He glanced at Tom, nodded toward another stool, and went to take his own chair, ignoring Allan, who had collapsed onto the floor and was curled up on his side like a kitten, holding his belly.

â€œSir?â€

Mrs. Bug, hearing the racket, had come out from her kitchen, and was standing in the doorway, eyes wide under her cap.

â€œWill ye . . . be needinâ€™ anything, sir?â€ she asked, making no pretense of not staring from Malva, red-faced and sobbing on her stool, to Allan, white and gasping on the floor.

Jamie thought that he needed a strong dramâ€”or maybe twoâ€”but that would have to wait.

â€œI thank ye, Mrs. Bug,â€ he said politely, â€œbut no. Weâ€™ll bide.â€ He lifted his fingers in dismissal, and she faded reluctantly from view. She hadnâ€™t gone far, though, he knew, just round the edge of the door.

He rubbed a hand over his face, wondering what it was about young girls these days. It was a full moon tonight; perhaps they truly did run lunatic.

On the other hand, the wee bitch had undoubtedly been playing the loon with someone; with her apron up like that, the bairn was showing plainly, a hard round swell like a calabash under her thin petticoat.

â€œHow long?â€ he asked Christie, with a nod toward her.

â€œSix months gone,â€ Christie said, and sank reluctantly onto the offered stool. He was dour as Jamie had ever seen him, but in control of himself, that was something.

â€œIt was when the sickness came late last summer; when I was here, helping to nurse his wife!â€ Malva burst out, lowering her apron and staring reproachfully at her father, full lip a-tremble. â€œAnd not just the once, either!â€ She switched her gaze back to Jamie, wet-eyed and pleading. â€œTell them, sir, pleaseâ€”tell them the truth!â€

â€œOh, I mean to,â€ he said, giving her a black look. â€œAnd yeâ€™ll do the same, lass, I assure ye.â€

The shock of it was beginning to fade, and while his sense of irritation remainedâ€”in fact, it was growing by the momentâ€”he was beginning to think, and furiously.

She was pregnant by someone grossly unsuitable; that much was clear. Who? Christ, he wished Claire had stayed; she listened to the gossip on the Ridge and she took interest in the lass; sheâ€™d know which young men were likely prospects. Heâ€™d seldom noticed young Malva particularly himself, save she was always about, helping Claire.

â€œThe first time was when Herself was so ill as we despaired of her life,â€ Malva said, snapping him back to attention. â€œI told ye, Faither. It wasna rapeâ€”only Himself being off his heid wiâ€™ the sorrow of it, and me, as well.â€ She blinked, a pearly tear sliding down the unmarked cheek. â€œI came down from her room late at night, to find him in here, sitting in the dark, and grieving. I felt so sorry for him. . . .â€ Her voice shook, and she stopped, swallowing.

â€œI asked could I fetch him a wee bite, maybe something to drinkâ€”but heâ€™d drink taken already, there was whisky in a glass before him. . . .â€

â€œAnd I said no, thank ye kindly, and that Iâ€™d be alone,â€ Jamie broke in, feeling the blood begin to surge in his temples at her recounting. â€œYe left.â€

â€œNo, I didnâ€™t.â€ She shook her head; the cap had come half off when she fell and she hadnâ€™t settled it again; dark tendrils of hair hung down, framing her face. â€œOr rather, ye did say that to me, that yeâ€™d be alone. But I couldnâ€™t bear to see ye in such straits, andâ€”I know â€™twas forward and unseemly, but I did pity ye so much!â€ she burst out, looking up and then immediately dropping her gaze again.

â€œI . . . I came and touched him,â€ she whispered, so low that he had trouble hearing her. â€œPut my hand on his shoulder, like, only to comfort him. But he turned then, and put his arms round me, all of a sudden and grasped me to him. Andâ€”and then . . .â€ She gulped, audibly.

â€œHe . . . he took me. Just . . . there.â€ The toe of one small buskin stretched out, pointing delicately at the rag rug just in front of the table. Where there was, in fact, a small and ancient brown stain, which might have been blood. It was bloodâ€”Jemmyâ€™s, left when the wee lad had tripped on the rug and bumped his nose so it bled.

He opened his mouth to speak, but was so choked by outraged amazement that nothing emerged but a sort of gasp.

â€œSo yeâ€™ve not the balls to deny it, eh?â€ Young Allan had recovered his breath; he was swaying on his knees, hair hanging in his face, and glaring. â€œBalls enough to do it, though!â€

Jamie gave Allan a quelling look, but didnâ€™t bother replying to him. He turned his attention instead to Tom Christie.

â€œIs she mad?â€ he inquired. â€œOr only clever?â€

Christieâ€™s face might have been carved in stone, save for the pouchy flesh quivering beneath his eyes, and the eyes themselves, bloodshot and narrowed.

â€œSheâ€™s not mad,â€ Christie said.

â€œA clever liar, then.â€ Jamie narrowed his own eyes at her. â€œClever enough to ken no one would believe a tale of rape.â€

Her mouth opened in horror.

â€œOh, no, sir,â€ she said, and shook her head so hard the dark curls danced by her ears. â€œI should never say such a thing of ye, never!â€ She swallowed, and timidly raised her eyes to meet hisâ€”swollen with weeping, but a soft dove gray, guileless with innocence.

â€œYe needed comfort,â€ she said, softly but clearly. â€œI gave it ye.â€

He pinched the bridge of his nose hard betwixt thumb and forefinger, hoping the sensation would wake him from what was plainly nightmare. This failing to occur, he sighed and looked at Tom Christie.

â€œSheâ€™s with child by someone, and not by me,â€ he said bluntly. â€œWho might it have been?â€

â€œIt was you!â€ the girl protested, letting her apron fall as she sat bolt upright on her stool. â€œThereâ€™s no one else!â€

Christieâ€™s eyes slid reluctantly toward his daughter, then came back to meet Jamieâ€™s. They were the same dove gray, but theyâ€™d never possessed any trace of either guilelessness or innocence.

â€œI know of no one,â€ he said. He took a deep breath, squaring his stocky shoulders. â€œShe says it wasnâ€™t just the once. That ye had her a dozen times or more.â€ His voice was nearly colorless, but not from lack of feeling, rather, from the grip he had upon his feelings.

â€œThen sheâ€™s lied a dozen times or more,â€ Jamie said, keeping his own voice under as much control as Christieâ€™s.

â€œYe know I have not! Your wife believes me,â€ Malva said, and a steely note had entered her voice. She lifted a hand to her cheek, where the flaming color had subsided but where the print of Claireâ€™s fingers was still clear, livid in outline.

â€œMy wife has better sense,â€ he said coldly, but was conscious all the same of a sinking sensation at the mention of Claire. Any woman might find such an accusation shock enough to make her fleeâ€”but he did wish that sheâ€™d stayed. Her presence, stoutly denying any misbehavior by him and personally rebuking Malvaâ€™s lies, would have helped.

â€œDoes she?â€ The vivid color had faded from the girlâ€™s face altogether, but she had stopped weeping. She was white-faced, her eyes huge and brilliant. â€œWell, Iâ€™ve sense, as well, sir. Sense enough to prove what I say.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ he said skeptically. â€œHow?â€

â€œIâ€™ve seen the scars on your naked body; I can describe them.â€

That declaration brought everyone up short. There was silence for a moment, broken by Allan Christieâ€™s grunt of satisfaction. He rose to his feet, one hand still pressed to his middle, but an unpleasant smile upon his face.

â€œSo, then?â€ he said. â€œNay answer to that one, have ye?â€

Irritation had long since given way to a monstrous anger. Under that, though, was the barest thread of something he would notâ€”not yetâ€”call fear.

â€œI dinna put my scars on display,â€ he said mildly, â€œbut there are a number of folk whoâ€™ve seen them, nonetheless. I havena lain with any of them, either.â€

â€œAye, folk speak sometimes of the scars on your back,â€ Malva shot back. â€œAnd everyone kens the great ugly one up your leg, that ye took at Culloden. But what of the crescent-shaped one across your ribs? Or the wee one on your left hurdie?â€ She reached a hand behind her, cupping her own buttock in illustration.

â€œNot in the center, quiteâ€”a bit down, on the outer side. About the size of a farthing.â€ She didnâ€™t smile, but something like triumph blazed in her eyes.

â€œI havena gotâ€”â€ he began, but then stopped, appalled. Christ, he did. A spiderâ€™s bite, taken in the Indies, that festered for a week, made an abscess, then burst, to his great relief. Once healed, heâ€™d never thought of it againâ€”but it was there.

Too late. Theyâ€™d seen the realization cross his face.

Tom Christie closed his eyes, jaw working under his beard. Allan grunted again with satisfaction, and crossed his arms.

â€œWant to show us sheâ€™s wrong?â€ the young man inquired sarcastically. â€œTake down your breeks, and gie us a look at your backside, then!â€

With a good deal of effort, he kept himself from telling Allan Christie what he could do with his own backside. He took a long, slow breath, hoping that by the time he let it out again, some useful thought would have come to him.

It didnâ€™t. Tom Christie opened his eyes with a sigh.

â€œSo,â€ he said flatly. â€œI suppose yeâ€™ll not intend to put aside your wife and marry her?â€

â€œI should never do such a thing!â€ The suggestion filled him with furyâ€”and something like panic at the mere notion of being without Claire.

â€œThen weâ€™ll draw a contract.â€ Christie rubbed a hand over his face, shoulders slumped with exhaustion and distaste. â€œMaintenance for her and the bairn. Formal acknowledgment of the childâ€™s rights as one of your heirs. Ye can decide, I suppose, if ye wish to take it for your wife to rear, but thatâ€”â€

â€œGet out.â€ He rose, very slowly, and leaned forward, hands on the table, eyes fixed on Christieâ€™s. â€œTake your daughter and leave my house.â€

Christie stopped speaking and looked at him, black-browed. The girl had started grieving again, making whimpering noises into her apron. Heâ€™d the odd feeling that time had stopped, somehow; they would all just be trapped here forever, himself and Christie staring each other down like dogs, unable to look down but knowing that the floor of the room had vanished beneath their feet and they hung suspended over some dreadful abyss, in the endless moment before the fall.

It was Allan Christie who broke it, of course. The movement of the young manâ€™s hand going to his knife freed Jamieâ€™s gaze from Christieâ€™s, and his fingers tightened, digging into the wood of the table. An instant before, heâ€™d felt bodiless; now blood hammered in his temples and pulsed through his limbs and his muscles trembled with an urgent need to damage Allan Christie. And wring his sisterâ€™s neck to stop her noise, as well.

Allan Christieâ€™s face was black with anger, but heâ€™d sense enoughâ€”barely, Jamie thoughtâ€”not to draw the knife.

â€œI should like nothing better, wee man, than to gie ye your heid in your hands to play with,â€ he said softly. â€œLeave now, before I do it.â€

Young Christie licked his lips and tensed himself, knucklebones going white on the hiltâ€”but his eyes wavered. He glanced at his father, who sat like a stone, grim-jowled and square. The light had changed; it shone from the side and through the grizzled tufts of Christieâ€™s beard, so his own scar showed, a thin pink rope that curled like a snake above his jaw.

Christie straightened slowly, pushing himself up with his hands on his thighs, then shook his head suddenly like a dog shaking off water and stood up. He gripped Malva by the arm, lifted her from her stool, and pushed her before him, weeping and stumbling on the way out.

Allan followed them, making occasion to brush so near to Jamie as he left that Jamie could smell the younger manâ€™s stink, ripe with fury. Young Christie cast a single angry glance back over his shoulder, hand still on his knifeâ€”but left. Their tread in the hall made the floorboards tremble under Jamieâ€™s feet, and then came the heavy slam of the door.

He looked down, then, vaguely surprised to see the battered surface of his table and his own hands still flattened there as if theyâ€™d grown to it. He straightened up and his fingers curled, the stiff joints painful as they made themselves into fists. He was drenched with sweat.

Lighter footsteps came down the hall then, and Mrs. Bug came in with a tray. She set it down before him, curtsied to him, and went out. The single crystal goblet that he owned was stood on it, and the decanter that held the good whisky.

He felt obscurely that he wanted to laugh, but couldnâ€™t quite remember how it was done. The light touched the decanter and the drink within glowed like a chrysoberyl. He touched the glass gently in acknowledgment of Mrs. Bugâ€™s loyalty, but that would have to wait. The Devil was loose in the world and thereâ€™d be hell to pay, surely. Before he did aught else, he must find Claire.



AFTER A TIME, the drifting clouds boiled up into thunderheads, and a cold breeze moved over the top of the hollow, shaking the laurels overhead with a rattling like dry bones. Very slowly, I got to my feet and began to climb.

I had no sure destination in mind; didnâ€™t care, really, if I were wet or not. I only knew that I couldnâ€™t go back to the house. As it was, I came to the trail that led to the White Spring, just as rain began to fall. Huge drops splattered on the leaves of pokeweed and burdock, and the firs and pines let go their long-held breath in a fragrant sigh.

The patter of drops on leaves and branches was punctuated by the muffled thud of heavier drops striking deep into soft earthâ€”hail was coming with the rain, and suddenly there were tiny white particles of ice bouncing crazily on the packed needles, peppering my face and neck with stinging cold.

I ran, then, and took shelter beneath the drooping branches of a balsam fir that overhung the spring. The hail pocked the water and made it dance, but melted on impact, disappearing at once into the dark water. I sat still, arms wrapped around myself against the chill, shivering.

You could almost understand, said the part of my mind that had begun talking somewhere on the journey up the hill. Everyone thought you were dyingâ€”including you. You know what happens . . . youâ€™ve seen it. People under the terrible strain of grief, those dealing with the presence of overwhelming deathâ€”Iâ€™d seen it. It was a natural seeking of solace; an attempt to hide, only for a moment, to deny deathâ€™s coldness by taking comfort in the simple warmth of bodily contact.

â€œBut he didnâ€™t,â€ I said stubbornly, out loud. â€œIf he had, and that was itâ€”I could forgive him. But God damn it, he didnâ€™t!â€

My subconscious subsided in the face of this certainty, but I was aware of subterranean stirringsâ€”not suspicions, nothing strong enough to be called doubts. Only small, cool observations that poked their heads above the surface of my own dark well like spring peepers, high, thin pipings that were barely audible individually but that together might eventually form a racket of sound to shake the night.

Youâ€™re an old woman.

See how the veins stand out on your hands.

The flesh has fallen away from your bones; your breasts sag.

If he were desperate, needing comfort . . .

He might reject her, but could never turn away from a child of his blood.

I closed my eyes and fought a rising sense of nausea. The hail had passed, succeeded by heavy rain, and cold steam began to rise from the ground, vapor drifting upward, disappearing like ghosts into the downpour.

â€œNo,â€ I said aloud. â€œNo!â€

I felt as though I had swallowed several large rocks, jagged and dirt-covered. It wasnâ€™t just the thought that Jamie mightâ€”but that Malva had most certainly betrayed me. Had betrayed me if it were trueâ€”and still more, if it were not.

My apprentice. My daughter of the heart.

I was safe from the rain, but the air was thick with water; my garments grew damp and hung heavy on me, clammy on my skin. Through the rain, I could see the big white stone that stood at the head of the spring, that gave the pool its name. Here it was that Jamie had shed his blood in sacrifice, and dashed it on that rock, asking the help of the kinsman he had slain. And here it was that Fergus had lain down, opening his veins in despair for his son, his blood blooming dark in the silent water.

And I began to realize why I had come here, why the place had called me. It was a place to meet oneself, and find truth.

The rain passed, and the clouds broke. Slowly, the light began to fade.



IT WAS NEARLY DARK when he came. The trees were moving, restless with twilight and whispering among themselves; I didnâ€™t hear his footsteps on the sodden trail. He was just there, suddenly, at the edge of the clearing.

He stood searching; I saw his head lift when he saw me, and then he strode round the pool and ducked under the overhanging branches of my shelter. Heâ€™d been out for some time, I saw; his coat was wet and the cloth of his shirt plastered to his chest with rain and sweat. Heâ€™d brought a cloak with him, bundled under his arm, and he unfolded this and wrapped it round my shoulders. I let him.

He sat quite close to me then, arms wrapped about his knees, and stared into the darkening pool of the spring. The light had reached that point of beauty, just before all color fades, and the hairs of his eyebrows arched auburn and perfect over the solid ridges of his brows, each hair distinct, like the shorter, darker hairs of his sprouting beard.

He breathed long and deep, as though he had been walking for some time, and rubbed away a drop of moisture that dripped from the end of his nose. Once or twice, he took a shorter breath, as though about to say something, but didnâ€™t.

The birds had come out briefly after the rain. Now they were going to their rest, cheeping softly in the trees.

â€œI do hope you were planning to say something,â€ I said finally, politely. â€œBecause if you donâ€™t, Iâ€™ll probably start screaming, and I might not be able to stop.â€

He made a sound somewhere between amusement and dismay, and sank his face into the palms of his hands. He stayed that way for a moment, then rubbed his hands hard over his face and sat up, sighing.

â€œI have been thinking all the time I was searching for ye, Sassenach, what in Godâ€™s name I should say when I found ye. I thought of one thing and anotherâ€”and . . . there seemed nothing whatever I could say.â€ He sounded helpless.

â€œHow is that?â€ I asked, a distinct edge in my voice. â€œI could think of a few things to say, I daresay.â€

He sighed, and made a brief gesture of frustration.

â€œWhat? To say I was sorryâ€”thatâ€™s not right. I am sorry, but to say soâ€”it sounds as though Iâ€™ve done something to be sorry for, and that I have not. But I thought to start off so would make ye maybe think . . .â€ He glanced at me. I was keeping a tight grip on both my face and my emotions, but he knew me very well. The instant heâ€™d said, â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ my stomach had plunged toward my feet.

He looked away.

â€œThereâ€™s naught I can say,â€ he said quietly, â€œthat doesna sound as though I try to defend or excuse myself. And I willna do that.â€

I made a small sound, as though someone had punched me in the stomach, and he glanced sharply at me.

â€œI wonâ€™t do it!â€ he said fiercely. â€œThere is no way to deny such a charge that doesna carry the stink of doubt about it. And nothing I can say to you that doesna sound like some groveling apology forâ€”forâ€”well, I willna apologize for something I havena done, and if I did, yeâ€™d only doubt me more.â€

I was beginning to breathe a little easier.

â€œYou donâ€™t seem to have a lot of faith in my faith in you.â€

He gave me a wary look.

â€œIf I hadna got quite a lot of it, Sassenach, I wouldna be here.â€

He watched me for a moment, then reached out and touched my hand. My fingers turned at once and curved to meet his, and our hands clasped tight. His fingers were big and cold and he held mine so tightly that I thought my bones would break.

He took a deep breath, almost a sob, and his shoulders, tight in his sodden coat, relaxed all at once.

â€œYe didna think it true?â€ he asked. â€œYe ran away.â€

â€œIt was a shock,â€ I said. And Iâ€™d thought, dimly, that if I stayed, I might just kill her.

â€œAye, it was,â€ he said very dryly. â€œI expect I might have run away myselfâ€”if I could.â€

A small twinge of guilt was added to the overload of emotions; I supposed my hasty exit couldnâ€™t have helped the situation. He didnâ€™t reproach me, though, but merely said again, â€œYe didna think it true, though?â€

â€œI donâ€™t.â€

â€œYe donâ€™t.â€ His eyes searched mine. â€œBut ye did?â€

â€œNo.â€ I pulled the cloak closer round me, settling it on my shoulders. â€œI didnâ€™t. But I didnâ€™t know why.â€

â€œAnd now ye do.â€

I took a deep, deep breath of my own and let it go, then turned to face him, straight on.

â€œJamie Fraser,â€ I said, with great deliberation. â€œIf you could do such a thing as thatâ€”and I donâ€™t mean lying with a woman, I mean doing it and lying to me about itâ€”then everything Iâ€™ve done and everything Iâ€™ve beenâ€”my whole lifeâ€”has been a lie. And I am not prepared to admit such a thing.â€

That surprised him a little; it was nearly dark now, but I saw his eyebrows rise.

â€œWhat dâ€™ye mean by that, Sassenach?â€

I waved a hand up the trail, where the house lay invisible above us, then toward the spring, where the white stone stood, a blur in the dark.

â€œI donâ€™t belong here,â€ I said softly. â€œBrianna, Roger . . . they donâ€™t belong here. Jemmy shouldnâ€™t be here; he should be watching cartoons on television, drawing pictures of cars and airplanes with crayonsâ€”not learning to shoot a gun as big as he is and cut the entrails from a deer.â€

I lifted my face and closed my eyes, feeling the damp settle on my skin, heavy on my lashes.

â€œBut we are here, all of us. And weâ€™re here because I loved you, more than the life that was mine. Because I believed you loved me the same way.â€

I took a deep breath, so that my voice wouldnâ€™t tremble, opened my eyes and turned to him.

â€œWill you tell me thatâ€™s not true?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said after a moment, so softly I could barely hear him. His hand tightened harder on mine. â€œNo, I willna tell ye that. Not ever, Claire.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ I said, and felt the anxiety and fury and fear of the afternoon run out of me like water. I rested my head on his shoulder, and breathed the rain and sweat on his skin. He smelled acrid, pungent with the musk of fear and curdled anger.

It was entirely dark by now. I could hear sounds in the distance, Mrs. Bug calling to Arch from the stable where sheâ€™d been milking the goats, and his cracked old voice hallooing back. A bat flittered past, silent and hunting.

â€œClaire?â€ Jamie said softly.

â€œHm?â€

â€œIâ€™ve got to tell ye something.â€

I froze. After a moment, I carefully detached myself from him and sat upright.

â€œDonâ€™t do that,â€ I said. â€œIt makes me feel as though Iâ€™ve been punched in the stomach.â€

â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€

I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to swallow the sudden feeling of nausea.

â€œYou said you wouldnâ€™t start off by saying you were sorry, because it felt as though there must be something to be sorry for.â€

â€œI did,â€ he said, and sighed.

I felt the movement between us as the two stiff fingers of his right hand thrummed against his leg.

â€œThere isna any good way,â€ he said finally, â€œof telling your wife yeâ€™ve lain wiâ€™ someone else. No matter what the circumstances. Thereâ€™s just not.â€

I felt suddenly dizzy, and short of breath. I closed my eyes momentarily. He didnâ€™t mean Malva; heâ€™d made that clear.

â€œWho?â€ I said as evenly as possible. â€œAnd when?â€

He stirred uneasily.

â€œOh. Well . . . when ye . . . when ye were . . . gone, to be sure.â€

I managed to take a short breath.

â€œWho?â€ I said.

â€œJust the once,â€ he said. â€œI meanâ€”I hadna the slightest intention ofâ€”â€

â€œWho?â€

He sighed, and rubbed hard at the back of his neck.

â€œChrist. The last thing I want is to upset ye, Sassenach, by sounding as though itâ€”but I dinna want to malign the puir woman by makinâ€™ it seem that she wasâ€”â€

â€œWHO?â€ I roared, seizing him by the arm.

â€œJesus!â€ he said, thoroughly startled. â€œMary MacNab.â€

â€œWho?â€ I said again, blankly this time.

â€œMary MacNab,â€ he repeated, and sighed. â€œCan ye let go, Sassenach? I think yeâ€™ve drawn blood.â€

I had, my fingernails digging hard enough into his wrist as to pierce the skin. I flung his hand away, and folded my own into fists, wrapping my arms around my body by way of stopping myself from strangling him.

â€œWho. The. Hell. Is. Mary. MacNab?â€ I said, through my teeth. My face was hot, but cold sweat prickled along my jaw and rolled down my ribs.

â€œYe ken her, Sassenach. She was wife to Rabâ€”him that died when his house was burnt. They had the one bairn, Rabbie; he was stable-lad at Lallybroch whenâ€”â€

â€œMary MacNab. Her?â€ I could hear the astonishment in my own voice. I did recall Mary MacNabâ€”barely. Sheâ€™d come to be a maid at Lallybroch after the death of her nasty husband; a small, wiry woman, worn with work and hardship, who seldom spoke, but went about her business like a shadow, never more than half-noticed in the rowdy chaos of life at Lallybroch.

â€œI scarcely noticed her,â€ I said, tryingâ€”and failingâ€”to remember whether she had been there on my last visit. â€œBut I gather you did?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, and sighed. â€œNot like ye mean, Sassenach.â€

â€œDonâ€™t call me that,â€ I said, my voice sounding low and venomous to my own ears.

He made a Scottish noise in his throat, of frustrated resignation, rubbing his wrist.

â€œAye. Well, see, â€™twas the night before I gave myself up to the Englishâ€”â€

â€œYou never told me that!â€

â€œNever told ye what?â€ He sounded confused.

â€œThat you gave yourself up to the English. We thought youâ€™d been captured.â€

â€œI was,â€ he said briefly. â€œBut by arrangement, for the price on my head.â€ He flipped a hand, dismissing the matter. â€œIt wasna important.â€

â€œThey might have hanged you!â€ And a good thing, too, said the small, furiously hurt voice inside.

â€œNo, they wouldnâ€™t.â€ A faint tinge of amusement showed in his voice. â€œYeâ€™d told me so, Sassâ€”mmphm. I didna really care, though, if they did.â€

I had no idea what he meant by saying Iâ€™d told him so, but I certainly didnâ€™t care at the moment.

â€œForget that,â€ I said tersely. â€œI want to knowâ€”â€

â€œAbout Mary. Aye, I ken.â€ He rubbed a hand slowly through his hair. â€œAye, well. She came to me, the night before Iâ€”I went. I was in the cave, ken, near Lallybroch, and she brought me supper. And then she . . . stayed.â€

I bit my tongue, not to interrupt. I could feel him gathering his thoughts, searching for words.

â€œI tried to send her away,â€ he said at last. â€œShe . . . well, what she said to me . . .â€ He glanced at me; I saw the movement of his head. â€œShe said sheâ€™d seen me with ye, Claireâ€”and that she kent the look of a true love when she saw it, for all sheâ€™d not had one herself. And that it wasna in her mind to make me betray that. But she would give me . . . some small thing. Thatâ€™s what she said to me,â€ he said, and his voice had grown husky, â€œâ€˜some small thing, that maybe ye can use.â€™â€

â€œIt wasâ€”I mean, it wasna . . .â€ He stopped, and made that odd shrugging motion of his, as though his shirt were tight across his shoulders. He bowed his head for a moment on his knees, hands linked round them.

â€œShe gave me tenderness,â€ he said finally, so softly that I barely heard him. â€œIâ€”I hope I gave her the same.â€

My throat and chest were too tight to speak, and tears prickled behind my eyes. I remembered, quite suddenly, what he had said to me the night I mended Tom Christieâ€™s hand, about the Sacred Heartâ€”â€œso wantingâ€”and no one to touch him.â€ And he had lived in a cave for seven years, alone.

There was no more than a foot of space between us, but it seemed an unbridgeable gulf.

I reached across it and laid my hand on his, the tips of my fingers on his big, weathered knuckles. I took a breath, then two, trying to steady my voice, but it cracked and broke, nonetheless.

â€œYou gave her . . . tenderness. I know you did.â€

He turned to me, suddenly, and my face was pressed into his coat, the cloth of it damp and rough on my skin, my tears blooming in tiny warm patches that vanished at once into the chill of the fabric.

â€œOh, Claire,â€ he whispered into my hair. I reached up, and could feel wetness on his cheeks. â€œShe saidâ€”she wished to keep ye alive for me. And she meant it; she didna mean to take anything for herself.â€

I cried then, holding nothing back. For empty years, yearning for the touch of a hand. Hollow years, lying beside a man I had betrayed, for whom I had no tenderness. For the terrors and doubts and griefs of the day. Cried for him and me and for Mary MacNab, who knew what loneliness wasâ€”and what love was, as well.

â€œI would have told ye, before,â€ he whispered, patting my back as though I were a small child. â€œBut it was . . . it was the once.â€ He shrugged a little, helpless. â€œAnd I couldna think how. How to say it, that yeâ€™d understand.â€

I sobbed, gulped air, and finally sat up, wiping my face carelessly on a fold of my skirt.

â€œI understand,â€ I said. My voice was thick and clogged, but fairly steady now. â€œI do.â€

And I did. Not only about Mary MacNab and what she had doneâ€”but why heâ€™d told me now. There was no need; I would never have known. No need but the need for absolute honesty between usâ€”and that I must know it was there.

I had believed him, about Malva. But now I had not only certainty of mindâ€”but peace of heart.

We sat close together, the folds of my cloak and skirts flowing over his legs, his simple presence a comfort. Somewhere nearby, a very early cricket began to chirp.

â€œThe rainâ€™s past, then,â€ I said, hearing it. He nodded, with a small sound of assent.

â€œWhat shall we do?â€ I said at last. My voice sounded calm.

â€œFind out the truthâ€”if I can.â€

Neither of us mentioned the possibility that he might not. I shifted, gathering the folds of my cloak.

â€œWill we go home, then?â€

It was too dark to see now, but I felt him nod as he got to his feet, putting down a hand to help me.

â€œAye, we will.â€



THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY when we returned, though Mrs. Bug had left a covered dish of shepherdâ€™s pie on the table, the floor swept, and the fire neatly smoored. I took off my wet cloak and hung it on the peg, but then stood, unsure quite what to do next, as though I stood in a strangerâ€™s house, in a country where I did not know the custom.

Jamie seemed to feel the same wayâ€”though after a moment, he stirred, fetched down the candlestick from the shelf over the hearth, and lit it with a spill from the fire. The wavering glow seemed only to emphasize the odd, echoing quality of the room, and he stood holding it for a minute, at a loss, before finally setting it down with a thump in the middle of the table.

â€œAre ye hungry, S . . . Sassenach?â€ He had begun to speak by habit, but then interrupted himself, looking up to be sure the name was once more allowed. I did my best to smile at him, though I could feel the corners of my mouth tremble.

â€œNo. Are you?â€

He shook his head, silent, and dropped his hand from the dish. Looking round for something else to do, he took up the poker and stirred the coals, breaking up the blackened embers and sending a swirl of sparks and soot up the chimney and out onto the hearth. It would ruin the fire, which would need to be rebuilt before bed, but I said nothingâ€”he knew that.

â€œIt feels like a death in the family,â€ I said at last. â€œAs though something terrible has happened, and this is the shocked bit, before you begin to send round and tell all the neighbors.â€

He gave a small, rueful laugh, and put the poker down.

â€œWeâ€™ll not need to. Theyâ€™ll all ken well enough by daybreak whatâ€™s happened.â€

Rousing at last from my immobility, I shook out my damp skirts and came to stand beside him by the fire. The heat of it seared at once through the wet cloth; it should have been comforting, but there was an icy weight in my abdomen that wouldnâ€™t melt. I put a hand on his arm, needing the touch of him.

â€œNo one will believe it,â€ I said. He put a hand over mine, and smiled a little, his eyes closed, but shook his head.

â€œTheyâ€™ll all believe it, Claire,â€ he said softly. â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€

BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT




IT ISNâ€™T FREAKING TRUE!â€

â€œNo, of course not.â€ Roger watched his wife warily; she was exhibiting the general symptoms of a large explosive device with an unstable timing mechanism, and he had the distinct feeling that it was dangerous to be in her vicinity.

â€œThat little bitch! I want to just grab her and choke the truth out of her!â€ Her hand closed convulsively on the neck of the syrup bottle, and he reached to take it from her before she should break it.

â€œI understand the impulse,â€ he said, â€œbut on the wholeâ€”better not.â€

She glared at him, but relinquished the bottle.

â€œCanâ€™t you do something?â€ she said.

Heâ€™d been asking himself that since heâ€™d heard the news of Malvaâ€™s accusation.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ he said. â€œBut I thought Iâ€™d go and talk to the Christies, at least. And if I can get Malva alone, I will.â€ Thinking of his last tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with Malva Christie, though, he had an uneasy feeling that she wouldnâ€™t be easily shaken from her story.

Brianna sat down, scowling at her plate of buckwheat cakes, and began slathering them with butter. Her fury was beginning to give way to rational thought; he could see ideas darting behind her eyes.

â€œIf you can get her to admit that itâ€™s not true,â€ she said slowly, â€œthatâ€™s good. If not, thoughâ€”the next best thing is to find out whoâ€™s been with her. If some guy will admit in public that he could be the fatherâ€”that would cast a lot of doubt on her story, at least.â€

â€œTrue.â€ Roger poured syrup sparingly over his own cakes, even in the midst of uncertainty and anxiety enjoying the thick dark smell of it and the anticipation of rare sweetness. â€œThough there would still be those whoâ€™d be convinced Jamieâ€™s guilty. Here.â€

â€œI saw her kissing Obadiah Henderson in the woods,â€ Bree said, accepting the bottle. â€œLate last fall.â€ She shuddered fastidiously. â€œIf it was him, no wonder she doesnâ€™t want to say.â€

Roger eyed her curiously. He knew Obadiah, who was large and uncouth, but not at all bad looking and not stupid. Some women would consider him a decent match; he had fifteen acres, which he farmed competently, and was a good hunter. Heâ€™d never seen Bree so much as speak to the man, though.

â€œCan you think of anybody else?â€ she asked, still frowning.

â€œWell . . . Bobby Higgins,â€ he replied, still wary. â€œThe Beardsley twins used to eye her now and then, but of course . . .â€ He had a nasty feeling that this line of inquiry was going to culminate in her adjuring him to go and ask awkward questions of any putative fathersâ€”a process that struck him as likely being both pointless and dangerous.

â€œWhy?â€ she demanded, cutting viciously into her stack of pancakes. â€œWhy would she do it? Mamaâ€™s always been so kind to her!â€

â€œOne of two reasons,â€ Roger replied, and paused for a moment, closing his eyes, the better to savor the decadence of melted butter and velvet-smooth maple syrup on fresh, hot buckwheat. He swallowed, and reluctantly opened his eyes.

â€œEither the real father is someone she doesnâ€™t want to marryâ€”for whatever reasonâ€”or sheâ€™s decided to try to get hold of your fatherâ€™s money or property, by getting him to settle a sum on her or, failing that, on the child.â€

â€œOr both. I mean, she doesnâ€™t want to marry whoever it is, and wants Daâ€™s moneyâ€”not that he has any.â€

â€œOr both,â€ he agreed.

They ate in silence for a few minutes, forks scraping on the wooden plates, each absorbed in thought. Jem had spent the night at the Big House; in the wake of Lizzieâ€™s marriage, Roger had suggested that Amy McCallum take over Lizzieâ€™s work as housemaid, and since she and Aidan had moved in, Jem spent even more time over there, finding solace for the loss of Germain in Aidanâ€™s companionship.

â€œIt isnâ€™t true,â€ she repeated stubbornly. â€œDa simply wouldnâ€™t . . .â€ But he saw the faint doubt at the back of her eyesâ€”and a slight glaze of panic at the thought.

â€œNo, he wouldnâ€™t,â€ he said firmly. â€œBriannaâ€”you canâ€™t possibly think thereâ€™s any truth to it?â€

â€œNo, of course not!â€ But she spoke too loudly, too definitely. He laid down his fork and looked at her levelly.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter? Do ye know something?â€

â€œNothing.â€ She chased the last bite of pancake round her plate, speared and ate it.

He made a skeptical sound, and she frowned at the sticky puddle left on her plate. She always poured too much honey or syrup; he, more sparing, always ended with a clean plate.

â€œI donâ€™t,â€ she said. She bit her lower lip, though, and put the tip of her finger into the puddle of syrup. â€œItâ€™s only . . .â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œNot Da,â€ she said slowly. She put the tip of her finger in her mouth and sucked the syrup off. â€œAnd I donâ€™t know for sure about Daddy. Itâ€™s onlyâ€”looking back at things I didnâ€™t understand at the timeâ€”now I seeâ€”â€ She stopped abruptly, and closed her eyes, then opened them, fixing him directly.

â€œI was looking through his wallet one day. Not snooping, just having fun, taking all the cards and things out and putting them back. There was a note tucked away, between the dollar bills. It was asking him to meet somebody for lunchâ€”â€

â€œInnocent enough.â€

â€œIt started out with Darlingâ€”, and it wasnâ€™t my motherâ€™s handwriting,â€ she said tersely.

â€œAh,â€ he said, and after a moment, â€œhow old were you?â€

â€œEleven.â€ She drew small patterns on the plate with the tip of her finger. â€œI just put the note back and kind of blotted it out of my mind. I didnâ€™t want to think about itâ€”and I donâ€™t think I ever did, from that day to this. There were a few other things, things I saw and didnâ€™t understandâ€”it was mostly the way things were between them, my parents . . . Every now and then, something would happen, and I never knew what, but I always knew something was really wrong.â€

She trailed off, sighed deeply, and wiped her finger on her napkin.

â€œBree,â€ he said gently. â€œJamieâ€™s an honorable man, and he loves your mother deeply.â€

â€œWell, see, thatâ€™s the thing,â€ she said softly. â€œI would have sworn Daddy was, too. And did.â€



IT WASNâ€™T IMPOSSIBLE. The thought kept returning, to niggle Roger uncomfortably, like a pebble in his shoe. Jamie Fraser was an honorable man, he was deeply uxoriousâ€”and he had been in the depths of despair and exhaustion during Claireâ€™s illness. Roger had feared for him nearly as much as for Claire; heâ€™d gone hollow-eyed and grim-jawed through the hot, endless days of reeking death, not eating, not sleeping, held together by nothing more than will.

Roger had tried to speak to him then, of God and eternity, reconcile him with what seemed the inevitable, only to be repulsed with a hot-eyed fury at the mere idea that God might think to take his wifeâ€”this followed by complete despair as Claire lapsed into a stupor near death. It wasnâ€™t impossible that the offer of a momentâ€™s physical comfort, made in that void of desolation, had gone further than either party intended.

But it was early May now, and Malva Christie was six months gone with child. Which meant that sheâ€™d got that way in November. The crisis of Claireâ€™s illness had been in late September; he remembered vividly the smell of burnt-over fields in the room when sheâ€™d wakened from what looked like certain death, her eyes huge and lambent, startlingly beautiful in a face like an androgynous angelâ€™s.

Right, then, it frigging was impossible. No man was perfect, and any man might yield in extremisâ€”once. But not repeatedly. And not Jamie Fraser. Malva Christie was a liar.

Feeling more settled in mind, Roger made his way down the creekside toward the Christiesâ€™ cabin.

Canâ€™t you do something? Brianna had asked him, anguished. Damn little, he thought, but he had to try. It was Friday; he couldâ€”and wouldâ€”preach an ear-blistering sermon on the evils of gossip, come Sunday. Knowing what he did of human nature, though, any benefit derived from that was likely to be short-lived.

Beyond thatâ€”well, Lodge meeting was Wednesday night. It had been going really well, and he hated to jeopardize the fragile amity of the newborn Lodge by risking unpleasantness at a meeting . . . but if there was a chance of it helping . . . would it be useful to encourage both Jamie and the two Christie men to attend? It would get the matter out in the open, and no matter how bad, open public knowledge was always better than the festering weed of whispered scandal. He thought Tom Christie would observe the proprieties and be civil, notwithstanding the delicacy of the situationâ€”but he wasnâ€™t all that sure of Allan. The son shared his fatherâ€™s features and his sense of self-righteousness, but lacked Tomâ€™s iron will and self-control.

But now he was at the cabin, which seemed deserted. He heard the sound of an ax, though, the slow klop! of kindling being split, and went round to the back.

It was Malva, who turned at his greeting, her face wary. There were lavender smudges beneath her eyes, he saw, and the bloom of her skin was clouded. Guilty conscience, he hoped, as he greeted her cordially.

â€œIf yeâ€™ve come to try to get me to take it back, I wonâ€™t,â€ she said flatly, ignoring his greeting.

â€œI came to ask if ye wanted someone to talk to,â€ he said. That surprised her; she set down the ax, and wiped her face with her apron.

â€œTo talk to?â€ she said slowly, eyeing him. â€œWhat about?â€

He shrugged and offered her a very slight smile.

â€œAnything ye like.â€ He let his accent relax, broadening toward her own Edinburgh tinge. â€œI doubt yeâ€™ve been able to talk to anyone of late, save your Da and brotherâ€”and they might not be able to listen just the noo.â€

A matching small smile flitted across her features, and disappeared.

â€œNo, they donâ€™t listen,â€ she said. â€œBut itâ€™s all right; Iâ€™ve naught much to say, ken? Iâ€™m a hoor; what else is there?â€

â€œI dinna think yeâ€™re a hoor,â€ Roger said quietly.

â€œOh, ye donâ€™t?â€ She rocked back a little on her heels, surveying him mockingly. â€œWhat else would ye call a woman that spreads her legs for a marrit man? Adulteress, of courseâ€”but hoor, as well, or so Iâ€™m told.â€

He thought she meant to shock him with deliberate coarseness. She did, rather, but he kept it to himself.

â€œMistaken, maybe. Jesus didna speak harshly to the woman who was a harlot; itâ€™s no my business to be doing it to someone who isnâ€™t.â€

â€œAnd if yeâ€™ve come to quote the Bible to me, save your breath to cool your parritch with,â€ she said, a look of distaste pulling down the delicate corners of her mouth. â€œIâ€™ve heard a deal more of it than I care to.â€

That, he reflected, was probably true. Tom Christie was the sort who knew a verseâ€”or tenâ€”for every occasion, and if he didnâ€™t beat his daughter physically, had almost certainly been doing it verbally.

Not sure what to say next, he held out his hand.

â€œIf yeâ€™ll give me the hatchet, Iâ€™ll do the rest.â€

One eyebrow raised, she put it into his hand and stepped back. He put up a chunk of kindling and split it clean in two, stooped for another. She watched for a moment, then sat down, slowly, on a smaller stump.

The mountain spring was still cool, touched with the last winter breath of the high snows, but the work warmed him. He didnâ€™t by any means forget she was there, but he kept his eyes on the wood, the bright grain of the fresh-split stick, the tug of it as he pulled the ax blade free, and found his thoughts move back to his conversation with Bree.

So Frank Randall had beenâ€”perhapsâ€”unfaithful to his wife, on occasion. In all justice, Roger wasnâ€™t sure he could be blamed, knowing the circumstances of the case. Claire had disappeared completely, without trace, leaving Frank to hunt desperately, to mourn, and then, at last, to begin to put the pieces of his life back together and move on. Whereupon the missing wife pops back up, distraught, mistreatedâ€”and pregnant by another man.

Whereupon Frank Randall, whether from a sense of honor, of love, or simply ofâ€”what? curiosity?â€”had taken her back. He recalled Claireâ€™s telling them the story, and it was clear that she hadnâ€™t particularly wanted to be taken back. It must have been damned clear to Frank Randall, too.

Little wonder, then, if outrage and rejection had led him occasionallyâ€”and little wonder, too, that the echoes of the hidden conflicts between her parents had reached Brianna, like seismic disturbances that travel through miles of earth and stone, jolts from an upwelling of magma, miles deep beneath the crust.

And little wonder, he realized with a sense of revelation, that sheâ€™d been so upset by his friendship with Amy McCallum.

He realized, quite suddenly, that Malva Christie was crying. Silently, without covering her face. Tears ran down her cheeks and her shoulders quivered, but her lower lip was caught hard between her teeth; she made no sound.

He cast down the ax and went to her. Put an arm gently round her shoulders, and cradled her capped head, patting her.

â€œHey,â€ he said softly. â€œDonâ€™t worry, aye? Itâ€™s going to be all right.â€

She shook her head, and the tears washed down her face.

â€œCanâ€™t be,â€ she whispered. â€œCanâ€™t be.â€

Beneath his pity for her, Roger was aware of a sense of growing hope. Whatever reluctance he might have to exploit her desperation was well overcome by a determination to get to the bottom of her trouble. Mostly for the sake of Jamie and his familyâ€”but for her own, as well.

He mustnâ€™t push too hard, though, mustnâ€™t rush. She had to trust him.

So he patted her, rubbed her back as he did for Jem when he woke with nightmare, said small soothing things, all meaningless, and felt her begin to yield. Yield, but in a strangely physical fashion, as though her flesh were somehow opening, blossoming slowly under his touch.

Strange, and at the same time, oddly familiar. Heâ€™d felt it now and then with Bree, when heâ€™d turned to her in the dark, when she hadnâ€™t time to think but responded to him with her body alone. The physical recollection jarred him, and he drew back a little. He meant to say something to Malva, but the sound of a footfall interrupted him, and he looked up to see Allan Christie coming toward him out of the trees, fast, with a face like black thunder.

â€œGet away from her!â€

He straightened, heart pounding as he realized quite suddenly what this might look like.

â€œWhat dâ€™ye mean, slinkinâ€™ round like a rat after a rind oâ€™ cheese?â€ Allan cried. â€œDâ€™ye think since sheâ€™s shamed, sheâ€™s meat for any whoreson bastard that cares to take her?â€

â€œI came to offer counsel,â€ Roger said as coolly as he could manage. â€œAnd comfort, if I might.â€

â€œOh, aye.â€ Allan Christieâ€™s face was flushed, the tufts of his hair standing on end like the bristles on a hog about to charge. â€œComfort me with apples and stay me with raisins, is it? Ye can stick your comfort straight up your arse, MacKenzie, and your goddamned stiff prick, too!â€

Allanâ€™s hands were clenched at his sides, trembling with rage.

â€œYeâ€™re no better than your wicked good-fatherâ€”or perhapsâ€â€”he rounded suddenly on Malva, who had stopped crying, but was sitting white-faced and frozen on her stumpâ€”â€œperhaps it was him, too? Is that it, ye wee bitch, did ye take them both? Answer me!â€ His hand shot out to slap her, and Roger caught his wrist by reflex.

Roger was so angry that he could barely speak. Christie was strong, but Roger was bigger; he would have broken the young manâ€™s wrist, if he could. As it was, he dug his fingers hard into the space between the bones, and was gratified to see Christieâ€™s eyes pop and water from the pain of it.

â€œYeâ€™ll not speak to your sister that way,â€ he said, not loudly, but very clearly. â€œNor to me.â€ He shifted his grip suddenly and bent Christieâ€™s wrist sharply backward. â€œDâ€™ye hear me?â€

Allanâ€™s face went white and the breath hissed out of him. He didnâ€™t answer, but managed to nod. Roger released his hold, almost flinging the younger manâ€™s wrist away, with a sudden feeling of revulsion.

â€œI do not wish to hear that yeâ€™ve abused your sister in any way,â€ he said, as evenly as he could. â€œIf I doâ€”yeâ€™ll regret it. Good day, Mr. Christie. Miss Christie,â€ he added, with a brief bow to Malva. She didnâ€™t respond, only stared at him from eyes gray as storm clouds, huge with shock. The memory of them followed him as he strode from the clearing and plunged into the darkness of the wood, wondering whether heâ€™d made things better, or much, much worse.



THE NEXT MEETING of the Fraserâ€™s Ridge Lodge was on Wednesday. Brianna went as usual to the Big House, taking Jemmy and her workbasket, and was surprised to find Bobby Higgins seated at the table, finishing his supper.

â€œMiss Brianna!â€ He half-rose at sight of her, beaming, but she waved him back to his seat, and slid into the bench opposite.

â€œBobby! How nice to see you again! We thoughtâ€”well, we thought you wouldnâ€™t come again.â€

He nodded, looking rueful.

â€œAye, happen I might not, at least not for a bit. But his Lordship had some things, things come in from England, and he says to me as I shall bring â€™em.â€ He ran a piece of bread carefully round the inside of his bowl, sopping up the last of Mrs. Bugâ€™s chicken gravy.

â€œAnd then . . . well, I did wish to come on my own account. For to see Miss Christie, aye?â€

â€œOh.â€ She glanced up and caught Mrs. Bugâ€™s eye. The older woman rolled her eyes, helpless, and shook her head. â€œUm. Yes, Malva. Er . . . is my mother upstairs, Mrs. Bug?â€

â€œNay, a nighean. She was called to Mr. MacNeill; heâ€™s bad wiâ€™ the pleurisy.â€ Barely pausing for breath, she whipped off her apron and hung it on its hook, reaching for her cloak with the other hand. â€œIâ€™ll be along, then, a leannan; Arch will be wanting his supper. If thereâ€™s aught wanting, Amyâ€™s about.â€ And with the briefest of farewells, she vanished, leaving Bobby staring after her in puzzlement at this uncharacteristic behavior.

â€œIs something amiss?â€ he asked, turning back to Brianna with a small frown.

â€œAhh . . . well.â€ With a few uncharitable thoughts toward Mrs. Bug, Brianna girded up her loins and told him, grimacing inwardly at the sight of his sweet young face as it turned white and rigid in the firelight.

She couldnâ€™t bring herself to mention Malvaâ€™s accusation, only told him that the girl was with child. Heâ€™d hear about Jamie, soon enough, but please God, not from her.

â€œI see, miss. Aye . . . I see.â€ He sat for a moment, staring at the bit of bread in his hand. Then he dropped it into his bowl, rose suddenly, and rushed outside; she heard him retching into the blackberry bushes outside the back door. He didnâ€™t come back.

It was a long evening. Her mother was plainly spending the night with Mr. MacNeill and his pleurisy. Amy McCallum came down for a little while, and they made awkward conversation over their sewing, but then the maid escaped upstairs. Aidan and Jemmy, allowed to stay up late and play, wore themselves out and fell asleep on the settle.

She fidgeted, abandoned her sewing, and paced up and down, waiting for Lodge to finish. She wanted her own bed, her own house; her parentsâ€™ kitchen, normally so welcoming, seemed strange and uncomfortable, and she a stranger in it.

At long, long last, she heard footsteps and the creak of the door, and Roger came in, looking bothered.

â€œThere you are,â€ she said with relief. â€œHow was Lodge? Did the Christies come?â€

He shook his head.

â€œNo. It . . . went all right, I suppose. A bit of awkwardness, of course, but your father carried it off as well as anyone might, in the circumstances.â€

She grimaced, imagining it.

â€œWhere is he?â€

â€œHe said he thought heâ€™d go and walk by himself for a bitâ€”maybe do a little night fishing.â€ Roger put his arms round her and hugged her close, sighing. â€œDid ye hear the ruckus?â€

â€œNo! What happened?â€

â€œWell, weâ€™d just had a wee blether on the universal nature of brotherly love, when a clishmaclaver broke out, over by your kiln. Well, so, everyone streamed out to see what was to do, and hereâ€™s your cousin Ian and wee Bobby Higgins, rolling in the dirt and trying to kill each other.â€

â€œOh, dear.â€ She felt a spasm of guilt. Probably someone had told Bobby everything, and he had gone in search of Jamie, meeting Ian instead, and thrown Malvaâ€™s accusations of Jamie at him. If sheâ€™d told him herself . . .

â€œWhat happened?â€

â€œWell, Ianâ€™s bloody dog took a hand, for the one thingâ€”or a paw. Your father barely stopped him tearing out Bobbyâ€™s throat, but it did stop the fight. We dragged them apart, then, and Ian tore free and loped off into the woods, with the dog beside him. Bobbyâ€™s . . . well, I cleaned him up a bit, then gave him Jemmyâ€™s trundle for the night,â€ he said apologetically. â€œHe said he couldna stay up hereâ€”â€ He looked round at the shadowed kitchen; sheâ€™d already smoored the fire and carried the little boys up to bed; the room was empty, lit only by a faint hearth glow.

â€œIâ€™m sorry. Will ye sleep here, then?â€

She shook her head emphatically.

â€œBobby or no Bobby, I want to go home.â€

â€œAye, all right. You go on, then; Iâ€™ll fetch Amy down to bar the door.â€

â€œNo, thatâ€™s okay,â€ she said quickly. â€œIâ€™ll get her.â€ And before he could protest, she was down the hall and up the stair, the empty house strange and silent below.

NOT THE END OF

THE WORLD




THERE IS A GREAT DEAL of satisfaction in wresting weeds out of the earth. Backbreaking and endless as the chore may be, there is a tiny but unassailable sense of triumph in it, feeling the soil give suddenly, yielding the stubborn root, and the foe lying defeated in your hand.

It had rained recently and the earth was soft. I ripped and tore with ferocious concentration; dandelions, fireweed, rhododendron sprouts, bunchgrass, muhly, smartweed, and the creeping mallow known locally as â€œcheese.â€ Paused for an instant, narrow-eyed at a bull thistle, and prised it from the ground with a vicious stab of my pruning knife.

The grapevines that ran up the palisades had just begun their spring rush, and sprouts and ruffles of a delicate green tinged with rust cascaded from the woody stems, eager tendrils curling like my own new-grown hairâ€”God damn her, sheâ€™d taken my hair on purpose to disfigure me! The shade they cast provided refuge for immense bushy growths of the pernicious thing I called â€œjewelweed,â€ not knowing its real name, for the tiny white flowers that winked like diamond clusters in the feathery green fronds. It was likely a fennel of some sort, but formed neither a useful bulb nor edible seeds; pretty, but uselessâ€”and thus the sort of thing that spreads like wildfire.

There was a small swishing sound, and a ball of rags came to rest by my foot. This was followed immediately by the rush of a much larger body, and Rollo swept past me, snatching the ball adroitly and galloping away, the wind of his passage stirring my skirts. Startled, I looked up, to see him bounding toward Ian, whoâ€™d come soft-footed into the garden.

He made a small gesture of apology, but I sat back on my heels and smiled at him, making an effort to quell the vicious sentiments surging to and fro in my bosom.

Evidently, the quelling wasnâ€™t all that successful, for I saw him frown a little, and hesitate, looking at my face.

â€œDid you want something, Ian?â€ I said shortly, dropping the facade of welcome. â€œIf that hound of yours knocks over one of my hives, Iâ€™ll make a rug of him.â€

â€œRollo!â€ Ian snapped his fingers at the dog, who leapt gracefully over the row of bee gums and basket hives that sat at the far end of the garden, trotted up to his master, dropped the ball at his feet, and stood genially panting, yellow wolf-eyes fixed with apparent interest on me.

Ian scooped up the ball, and turning, flung it out through the open gate, Rollo after it like the tail of a comet.

â€œI did want to ask ye something, Auntie,â€ he said, turning back to me. â€œIt would wait, though.â€

â€œNo, thatâ€™s all right. Nowâ€™s as good a time as any.â€ Getting awkwardly to my feet, I waved him to the little bench Jamie had made for me in a shady nook beneath a flowering dogwood that overhung the corner of the garden.

â€œSo?â€ I settled myself beside him, brushing crumbs of dirt from the bottom of my skirt.

â€œMmphm. Well . . .â€ He stared at his hands, linked over his knee, big-knuckled and bony. â€œI . . . ah . . .â€

â€œYou havenâ€™t been exposed to syphilis again, have you?â€ I asked, with a vivid memory of my last interview with an awkward young man in this garden. â€œBecause if you have, Ian, I swear I will use Dr. Fentimanâ€™s syringe on you and I wonâ€™t be gentle with it. Youâ€”â€

â€œNo, no!â€ he said hastily. â€œNo, of course not, Auntie. Itâ€™s aboutâ€”about Malva Christie.â€ He tensed as he said it, in case I should lunge for the pruning knife, but I merely drew a deep breath and let it out again, slowly.

â€œWhat about her?â€ I said, my voice deliberately even.

â€œWell . . . no really her, exactly. More what she saidâ€”about Uncle Jamie.â€ He stopped, swallowing, and I drew another slow breath. Disturbed as I was by the situation myself, Iâ€™d scarcely thought about its impact on anyone else. But Ian had idolized Jamie from the time he was a tiny boy; I could well imagine that the widespread suggestions that Jamie might have feet of clay were deeply upsetting to him.

â€œIan, you mustnâ€™t worry yourself.â€ I put a consoling handâ€”dirt-stained as it wasâ€”on his arm. â€œIt will . . . work itself out, somehow. Such things always do.â€ They didâ€”generally with the maximum of uproar and catastrophe. And if Malvaâ€™s child should by some horrid cosmic joke be born with red hair . . . I closed my eyes for a moment, feeling a wave of dizziness.

â€œAye, I suppose they will,â€ Ian said, sounding uncertain in the extreme. â€œItâ€™s onlyâ€”what theyâ€™re sayinâ€™, about Uncle Jamie. Even his own Ardsmuir men, folk that should know better! That he must haveâ€”well, Iâ€™ll no repeat any of it, Auntieâ€”but . . . I canna bear to hear it!â€

His long, homely face was twisted with unhappiness, and it suddenly occurred to me that he might be having his own doubts about the matter.

â€œIan,â€ I said, with as much firmness as I could muster, â€œMalvaâ€™s child could not possibly be Jamieâ€™s. You do believe that, donâ€™t you?â€

He nodded, very slowly, but wouldnâ€™t meet my eyes.

â€œI do,â€ he said softly, and then swallowed hard. â€œBut, Auntie . . . it could be mine.â€

A bee had lighted on my arm. I stared at it, seeing the veins in its glassy wings, the dust of yellow pollen that clung to the minuscule hairs of its legs and abdomen, the gentle pulsing of its body as it breathed.

â€œOh, Ian,â€ I said as softly as heâ€™d spoken himself. â€œOh, Ian.â€

He was strung tight as a marionette, but when I spoke, a little of the tension left the arm under my hand, and I saw that he had closed his eyes.

â€œIâ€™m sorry, Auntie,â€ he whispered.

Wordless, I patted his arm. The bee flew off, and I wished passionately that I could exchange places with it. It would be so wonderful, simply to be about the business of gathering, single-minded in the sun.

Another bee lighted on Ianâ€™s collar, and he brushed it absently away.

â€œWell, so,â€ he said, taking a deep breath and turning his head to look at me. â€œWhat must I do, Auntie?â€

His eyes were dark with misery and worryâ€”and something very like fear, I thought.

â€œDo?â€ I said, sounding as blank as I felt. â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ, Ian.â€

I hadnâ€™t meant to make him smile, and he didnâ€™t, but he did seem to relax very slightly.

â€œAye, Iâ€™ve done it already,â€ he said, very rueful. â€œButâ€”itâ€™s done, Auntie. How can I mend it?â€

I rubbed my brow, trying to think. Rollo had brought back his ball, but seeing that Ian was in no mood to play, dropped it by his feet and leaned against his leg, panting.

â€œMalva,â€ I said finally. â€œDid she tell you? Before, I mean.â€

â€œYe think I scorned her, and thatâ€™s what made her accuse Uncle Jamie?â€ He gave me a wry look, absently scratching Rolloâ€™s ruff. â€œWell, I wouldna blame ye if ye did, Auntie, but no. She said not a word to me about the matter. If she had, I should haâ€™ marrit her at once.â€

The hurdle of confession overcome, he was talking more easily now.

â€œYou didnâ€™t think of marrying her first?â€ I said, with perhaps a slight tinge of acerbity.

â€œAh . . . no,â€ he said, very sheepish. â€œIt wasna precisely a matter ofâ€”well, I wasna thinking at all, Auntie. I was drunk. The first time, anyway,â€ he added as an afterthought.

â€œThe firstâ€”? How manyâ€” No, donâ€™t tell me. I donâ€™t want to know the gory details.â€ I shut him up with a brusque gesture, and sat up straight, struck by a thought. â€œBobby Higgins. Was thatâ€”â€

He nodded, lowering his lashes so I couldnâ€™t see his eyes. The blood had come up under his tan.

â€œAye. That was whyâ€”I mean, I didna really wish to marry her, to begin with, but still, I would have asked, after we . . . but I put it off a bit, andâ€”â€ He scrubbed a hand across his face, helpless. â€œWell, I didna want her to wife, but I couldna keep from wanting her, nonetheless, and I ken well enough how awful it must seemâ€”but Iâ€™ve got to tell the truth, Auntie, and thatâ€™s it.â€ He took a gulp of air, and continued.

â€œIâ€™dâ€”wait for her. In the woods, when she came to gather. Sheâ€™d not speak when she saw me, only smile, and raise her skirts a bit, then turn quick and run and . . . God, I should be after her like a dog after a bitch in heat,â€ he said bitterly. â€œBut then one day I came late, and she wasna there where we usually met. But I heard her laughing, far off, and when I went to see . . .â€

He twisted his hands hard enough to dislocate a finger, grimacing, and Rollo whined softly.

â€œLet us just say that yon bairn might well be Bobby Higginsâ€™s, too,â€ he said, biting off the words.

I felt suddenly exhausted, as I had when recovering from my illness, as though it was too much effort even to breathe. I leaned back against the palisades, feeling the cool papery rustle of grape leaves against my neck, fanning softly over my heated cheeks.

Ian bent forward, head in his hands, the dappled green shadows playing over him.

â€œWhat shall I do?â€ he asked at last, voice muffled. He sounded as tired as I felt. â€œI dinna mind saying that Iâ€”that the child might be mine. But would it help, dâ€™ye think?â€

â€œNo,â€ I said bleakly. â€œIt wouldnâ€™t.â€ Public opinion would not be changed in the slightest; everyone would simply assume that Ian was lying for his uncleâ€™s sake. Even if he were to marry the girl, it wouldnâ€™tâ€”

A thought struck me and I pulled myself upright again.

â€œYou said you didnâ€™t want to marry her, even before you knew about Bobby. Why?â€ I asked curiously.

He lifted his head from his hands with a helpless gesture.

â€œI dinna ken how to say it. She wasâ€”well, she was bonnie enough, aye, and a proper spirit to her, as well. But she . . . I dinna ken, Auntie. It was only that I always had the feeling, lying wiâ€™ herâ€”that I dare not fall asleep.â€

I stared at him.

â€œWell, that would be off-putting, I imagine.â€

He had dismissed that, though, and was frowning, digging the heel of his moccasin into the soil.

â€œThereâ€™s no means of telling which of two men has fathered a bairn, is there?â€ he asked abruptly. â€œOnlyâ€”if itâ€™s mine, I should want it. I would wed her for the childâ€™s sake, no matter what else. If itâ€™s mine.â€

Bree had told me the bare bones of his history; I knew about his Mohawk wife, Emily, and the death of his daughter, and I felt the small presence of my own first child, Faith, stillborn but always with me.

â€œOh, Ian,â€ I said softly, and touched his hair. â€œYou might be able to tell, by the way the child lookedâ€”but probably not, or not right away.â€

He nodded, and sighed. After a moment, he said, â€œIf I say itâ€™s mine, and I wed herâ€”folk might still talk, but after a time . . .â€ His voice died away. True, talk might eventually die down. But there would still be those who thought Jamie responsible, others who would call Malva a whore, a liar, or bothâ€”which she bloody well was, I reminded myself, but not a nice thing to hear about oneâ€™s wife. And what might Ianâ€™s life be like, married under such circumstances, to a woman he could not trust andâ€”I thoughtâ€”did not especially like?

â€œWell,â€ I said, rising to my feet and stretching, â€œdonâ€™t do anything drastic just yet awhile. Let me talk with Jamie; you donâ€™t mind if I tell him?â€

â€œI wish ye would, Auntie. I dinna think I could face him, myself.â€ He still sat on the bench, bony shoulders slumped. Rollo lay on the ground at his feet, the big wolf head resting on Ianâ€™s moccasined foot. Moved with pity, I put my arms round Ian, and he leaned his head against me, simply, like a child.

â€œIt isnâ€™t the end of the world,â€ I said.

The sun was touching the edge of the mountain, and the sky burned red and gold, the light of it falling in blazing bars through the palisades.

â€œNo,â€ he said, but there was no conviction in his voice.

DECLARATIONS




Charlotte, Mecklenberg County

May 20, 1775

THE ONE THING ROGER HAD NOT envisioned about the making of history was the sheer amount of alcohol involved. He should have, he thought; if there was anything a career in academia had taught him, it was that almost all worthwhile business was conducted in the pub.

The public houses, taverns, ordinaries, and pothouses in Charlotte were doing a roaring business, as delegates, spectators, and hangers-on seethed through them, men of Loyalist sentiments collecting in the Kingâ€™s Arms, those of rabidly opposing views in the Blue Boar, with shifting currents of the unallied and undecided eddying to and fro, purling through the Goose and Oyster, Thomasâ€™s ordinary, the Groats, Simonâ€™s, Buchananâ€™s, Muellerâ€™s, and two or three nameless places that barely qualified as shebeens.

Jamie visited all of them. And drank in all of them, sharing beer, ale, rum punch, shandy, cordial, porter, stout, cider, brandywine, persimmon beer, rhubarb wine, blackberry wine, cherry bounce, perry, merry brew, and scrumpy. Not all of them were alcoholic, but the great majority were.

Roger confined himself largely to beer, and found himself glad of his restraint, when he happened to meet with Davy Caldwell in the street, turning from a fruitererâ€™s stall with a handful of early apricots.

â€œMr. MacKenzie!â€ Caldwell cried, his face lighting with welcome. â€œI had nay thought to meet you here, but what blessing that I have!â€

â€œBlessing indeed,â€ Roger said, shaking the ministerâ€™s hand with cordial fervor. Caldwell had married him and Brianna, and had examined him at the Presbyterian Academy regarding his own calling, some months before. â€œHow dâ€™ye do, Mr. Caldwell?â€

â€œOch, for myself, well enoughâ€”but my heart misgives me for the fate of my poor brethren!â€ Caldwell shook his head in dismay, gesturing at a group of men crowding into Simonâ€™s ordinary, laughing and talking. â€œWhat is to come of this, I ask ye, Mr. MacKenzieâ€”whatâ€™s to come?â€

Roger was, for an unbalanced instant, tempted to tell him what was to come of it, exactly. As it was, though, he gestured to Jamieâ€”who had been stopped by an acquaintance in the streetâ€”to go along without him, and turned away to walk a bit with Caldwell.

â€œHave ye come for the conference, then, Mr. Caldwell?â€ he asked.

â€œI have that, Mr. MacKenzie, I have that. Little hope have I that my words will make the slightest difference, but it is my duty to speak as I find, and so I shall.â€

What Davy Caldwell found was a shocking condition of human slothfulness, for which he blamed the entire current situation, convinced that unreflective apathy and â€œa stupid concern with personal comfortâ€ on the part of the colonists both tempted and provoked the exercise of tyrannical powers on the part of Crown and Parliament.

â€œItâ€™s a point, sure,â€ Roger said, aware that Caldwellâ€™s impassioned gestures were attracting a certain amount of notice, even amongst the crowds in the street, most of them reasonably argumentative themselves.

â€œA point!â€ Caldwell cried. â€œAye, it is, and the point entirely. The ignorance, disregard of moral obligation, and the supreme love of ease of the groveling sluggard corresponds exactlyâ€”exactly!â€”with a tyrantâ€™s appetite and cynicism.â€

He glowered at one gentleman who had subsided against the side of a house, taking a brief respite from the noonday heat with his hat over his face.

â€œThe spirit of God must redeem the slothful, fill the human frame with activity, poise, and libertarian consciousness!â€

Roger wondered, rather, whether Caldwell would view the escalating war as the result of Godâ€™s interventionâ€”but upon reflection, thought that he likely would. Caldwell was a thinker, but a staunch Presbyterian, and thus a believer in predestination.

â€œThe slothful encourage and facilitate oppression,â€ Caldwell explained, with a scornful gesture toward a family of tinkers enjoying an alfresco luncheon in the yard of a house. â€œTheir own shame and sinking spirits, their own pitiful compliance and submissionâ€”these become self-made chains of slavery!â€

â€œOh, aye,â€ Roger said, and coughed. Caldwell was a famous preacher, and rather inclined to want to keep in practice. â€œWill ye take a whet, Mr. Caldwell?â€ It was a warm day, and Caldwellâ€™s rather round, cherubic face was becoming very red.

They went into Thomasâ€™s ordinary, a fairly respectable house, and sat down with tankards of the house beerâ€”for Caldwell, like most, did not regard beer as being in any way â€œdrink,â€ like rum or whisky. What else, after all, would one drink? Milk?

Out of the sun, and with a cooling draught to hand, Davy Caldwell became less heated in his expressions, as well as his countenance.

â€œPraise God for the fortune of meeting ye here, Mr. MacKenzie,â€ he said, breathing deep after lowering his tankard. â€œI had sent a letter, but doubtless ye will have left home before it could come. I wished to inform ye of the gladsome newsâ€”there is to be a Presbytery.â€

Roger felt a sudden leap of the heart.

â€œWhen? And where?â€

â€œEdenton, early next month. The Reverend Doctor McCorkle is coming from Philadelphia. Heâ€™ll remain for a time, before departing on his further journeyâ€”he is going to the Indies, to encourage the efforts of the church there. I am, of course, presuming to know your mindâ€”I apologize for the forwardness of my address, Mr. MacKenzieâ€”but is it still your desire to seek ordination?â€

â€œWith all my heart.â€

Caldwell beamed, and grasped him strongly by the hand.

â€œGive ye joy of it, dear manâ€”great joy.â€

He then plunged into a close description of McCorkle, whom he had met in Scotland, and speculations regarding the state of religion in the colonyâ€”he spoke of Methodism with some respect, but considered the New Light Baptists â€œsomewhat unregulatedâ€ in their effusions of worship, though doubtless well-meaningâ€”and surely sincere belief was an improvement over unbelief, whatever the form it might take. In due course, though, he came back round to their present circumstances.

â€œYeâ€™ve come with your father-in-law, have ye?â€ he asked. â€œI thought I saw him, in the road.â€

â€œI have, and ye did,â€ Roger assured him, fumbling in his pocket for a coin. The pocket itself was full of coiled horsehair; with his academic experience as guide, he had made provision against possible boredom by bringing the makings of a new fishing line.

â€œAh.â€ Caldwell looked at him keenly. â€œIâ€™ve heard things of lateâ€”is it true, heâ€™s turned Whig?â€

â€œHe is a firm friend to liberty,â€ Roger said, cautious, and took a breath. â€œAs am I.â€ Heâ€™d not had occasion to say it out loud before; it gave him a small, breathless feeling, just under the breastbone.

â€œAha, aha, very good! I had heard of it, as I sayâ€”and yet there are a great many who say otherwise: that he is a Tory, a Loyalist like his relations, and that this protestation of support for the independency movement is but a ruse.â€ It wasnâ€™t phrased as a question, but Caldwellâ€™s bushy eyebrow, cocked like a swellâ€™s hat, made it clear that it was.

â€œJamie Fraser is an honest man,â€ Roger said, and drained his tankard. â€œAnd an honorable one,â€ he added, setting it down. â€œAnd speaking of the same, I think I must go and find him.â€

Caldwell glanced around; there was an air of restlessness around them, of men calling their accounts and settling up. The official meeting of the convention was to begin at two oâ€™clock, at MacIntyreâ€™s farmhouse. It was past noon now, delegates, speakers, and spectators would be slowly gathering, girding themselves for an afternoon of conflict and decision. The breathless feeling came back.

â€œAye, then. Give him my regards, if ye willâ€”though perhaps I may see him myself. And may the Holy Spirit penetrate the encrustations of habit and lethargy, and convert the souls and rouse the consciences of those who gather here today!â€

â€œAmen,â€ said Roger, smiling in spite of the glances from the menâ€”and not a few womenâ€”around them.

He found Jamie in the Blue Boar, in the company of a number of men in whom the Holy Spirit had already been hard at work on the encrustations, judging from the volume. The chatter near the door died away, though, as he made his way through the roomâ€”not in cause of his own presence, but because there was something more interesting going on near the center.

To wit: Jamie Fraser and Neil Forbes, both red with heat, passion, and a gallon or two of mixed spirits, head to head over a table, and hissing like snakes in the Gaelic.

Only a few of the spectators were Gaelic speakers; these were hastily translating the high points of the dialogue for the rest of the crowd.

Gaelic insult was an art, and one at which his father-in-law excelled, though Roger was obliged to admit that the lawyer was no slouch at it, himself. The translations rendered by the onlookers fell far short of the original; nonetheless, the taproom was rapt, with occasional admiring whistles or whoops from the spectators, or laughter as a particularly pungent point was made.

Having missed the beginning, Roger had no idea how the conflict had begun, but so far into it as they were, the exchange was focused on cowardice and arrogance, Jamieâ€™s remarks aimed at Forbesâ€™s leading the attack on Fogarty Simms as a low-minded and cowardly attempt to make himself look the big man at the price of a defenseless manâ€™s life, Forbesâ€”shifting into English here, as he realized that they had become the cynosure of the roomâ€”taking the view that Jamieâ€™s presence here was an unwarrantable affront to those who truly held the ideals of liberty and justice, as everyone knew he was in truth the Kingâ€™s man, but he, the puffed-up cock oâ€™ the walk, thought that he could pull the wool over everyoneâ€™s eyes long enough to betray the whole boiling, but if he, Fraser, thought he, Forbes, was fool enough to be gulled by antic tricks in the public street and a lot of talk with nay more substance than the shrieking of gulls, he, Fraser, had best think again!

Jamie slapped a hand flat on the table, making it boom like a drum, and rattling the cups. He rose, glaring down at Forbes.

â€œDo ye libel my honor, sir?â€ he cried, also shifting to English. â€œFor if ye do, let us go out, and we shall settle the matter at once, yea or nay!â€

Sweat was streaming down Forbesâ€™s broad, flushed face, and his eyes were gleaming with anger, but even overheated as he was, Roger saw belated caution pluck at his sleeve. Roger hadnâ€™t seen the fight in Cross Creek, but Ian had told him the details, meanwhile laughing his head off. The last thing Neil Forbes could desire was a duel.

â€œHave ye honor to libel, sir?â€ Forbes demanded, standing in turn, and drawing himself up as though about to address the jury. â€œYe come here acting the great one, carousing and showing away like a sailor come ashore with prize money in his pocketâ€”but have we any evidence that your words are more than puffery? Puffery, I say, sir!â€

Jamie stood, both hands braced on the tabletop, surveying Forbes through narrowed eyes. Roger had once seen that expression focused on himself. It had been followed rapidly by the sort of mayhem customary in a Glasgow pub on Saturday nightâ€”only more so. The only thing to be thankful for was that Forbes had clearly not heard any whiff of Malva Christieâ€™s accusation, or there would be blood on the floor already.

Jamie straightened slowly, and his left hand went toward his waist. There were gasps, and Forbes paled. But Jamie had reached for his sporran, not his dirk, and plunged his hand inside.

â€œAs to that . . . sir . . .â€ he said in a low, even voice that carried through the room, â€œI have made myself clear. I am for liberty, and to that end, I pledge my name, my fortuneâ€â€”here he withdrew his hand from his sporran and slammed it on the table; a small purse, two golden guineas, and a jewelâ€”â€œand my sacred honor.â€

The room was silent, all eyes focused on the black diamond, which shimmered with a baleful light. Jamie paused for the space of three heartbeats, then drew breath.

â€œIs there any man here who gives me the lie?â€ he said. It was ostensibly addressed to the room at large, but his eyes were fixed on Forbes. The lawyer had gone a mottled red and gray, like a bad oyster, but said nothing.

Jamie paused again, looked once round the room, then picked up purse, money, and jewel, and stalked out the door. Outside, the town clock chimed two, the strokes slow and heavy in the humid air.

AMONG THE LETTUCES




SOME IDIOTâ€”OR CHILDâ€” had left the gate of my garden open. I hurried up the path, hoping that it hadnâ€™t been that way for long. If it had been open overnight, the deer would have eaten every lettuce, onion, and bulb plant in the plot, to say nothing of ruining theâ€”

I jerked, letting out a small cry. Something like a red-hot hat pin had stabbed me in the neck, and I smacked the place by reflex. An electric jab in the temple made my vision go white, then blur with water, and a fiery stab in the crook of my elbowâ€”bees.

I blundered off the path, suddenly aware that the air was full of them, frenzied and stinging. I plunged through the brush, barely able to see for the watering of my eyes, aware too late of the low-pitched thrum of a hive at war.

Bear! God damn it, a bear had got in! In the half-second between the first sting and the next, I had glimpsed one of the bee gums lying on its side in the dirt just inside the gate, combs and honey spilling out of it like entrails.

I ducked under branches and flung myself into a patch of pokeweed, gasping and cursing incoherently. The sting on my neck throbbed viciously, and the one on my temple was already puffing up, pulling at the eyelid on that side. I felt something crawling on my ankle, and batted it away by reflex before it could sting.

I wiped tears away, blinking. A few bees sailed past through the yellow-flowered stems above me, aggressive as Spitfires. I crawled a little farther, trying at once to get away, slap at my hair, and shake out my skirts, lest any more of them be trapped in my clothes.

I was breathing like a steam engine, shaking with adrenaline and fury.

â€œBloody hell . . . frigging bear . . . God damn it . . .â€

My strong impulse was to rush in screaming and flapping my skirts, in hopes of panicking the bear. An equally strong impulse of self-preservation overcame it.

I scrambled to my feet, and keeping low in case of enraged bees, thrust my way through the brush uphill, meaning to circle the garden and come down on the other side, away from the ravaged hives. I could get back to the path that way and down to the house, where I could recruit helpâ€”preferably armedâ€”to drive away the monster before it destroyed the rest of the hives.

No point in keeping quiet, and I crashed through bushes and stumbled over logs, panting with rage. I tried to see the bear, but the growth of grapevines over the palisades was too thick to show me anything but rustling leaves and sun shadows. The side of my face felt as though it were on fire, and jolts of pain shot through the trigeminal nerve with each heartbeat, making the muscles twitch and the eye water terribly.

I reached the path just below the spot where the first bee had stung meâ€”my gardening basket lay where Iâ€™d dropped it, tools spilled out. I grabbed the knife I used for everything from pruning to digging roots; it was a stout thing, with a six-inch blade, and while it might not impress the bear, I felt better for having it.

I glanced at the open gate, ready to runâ€”but saw nothing. The ruined hive lay just as Iâ€™d seen it, the wax combs broken and squashed, the smell of honey thick in the air. But the combs were not scattered; shattered pillars of wax still stuck to the exposed wooden base of the hive.

A bee zoomed menacingly past my ear and I ducked, but didnâ€™t run. It was quiet. I tried to stop panting, trying to hear over the thunder of my own racing pulse. Bears werenâ€™t quiet; they didnâ€™t need to be. I should hear snufflings and gulping noises, at leastâ€”rustlings of broken foliage, the lap of a long tongue. I didnâ€™t.

Cautiously, I moved sideways up the path, a step at a time, ready to run. There was a good-size oak, about twenty feet away. Could I make that, if the bear popped out?

I listened as hard as I could, but heard nothing beyond the soft rustle of the grapevines and the sound of angry bees, now dropped to a whining hum as they gathered thick on the remnants of their combs.

It was gone. Had to be. Still wary, I edged closer, knife in hand.

I smelled the blood and saw her in the same instant. She was lying in the salad bed, her skirt flown out like some gigantic, rusty flower blooming amid the young lettuces.

I was kneeling by her, with no memory of reaching her, and the flesh of her arm was warm when I grasped her wristâ€”such small, fragile bonesâ€”but slack, there was no pulseâ€”Of course not, said the cold small watcher inside, her throat is cut, thereâ€™s blood everywhere, but you can see the artery isnâ€™t pumping; sheâ€™s dead.

Malvaâ€™s gray eyes were open, blank with surprise, and her cap had fallen off. I clutched her wrist harder, as though I must be able to find the buried pulse, to find some trace of life . . . and did. The bulge of her belly moved, very slightly, and I dropped the flaccid arm at once and seized my knife, scrabbling for the hem of her skirt.

I acted without thought, without fear, without doubtâ€”there wasnâ€™t anything but the knife and the pressure, the flesh parting and the faint possibility, the panic of absolute need . . .

I slit the belly from navel to pubis, pushing hard through slack muscle, nicked the womb but no matter, cut quick but careful through the wall of the womb, dropped the knife, and thrust my hands into the depths of Malva Christie, still blood-warm, and seized the child, cupping, turning, wrenching hard in my frenzy to pull it free, bring it out from sure death, bring it into the air, help it breathe. . . . Malvaâ€™s body flopped and heaved as I jerked, limp limbs flailing with the force of my yanking.

It came free with the suddenness of birth, and I was swiping blood and mucus from the tiny sealed face, blowing into its lungs, gently, gently, you have to blow gently, the alveoli of the lungs are like cobwebs, so small, compressing its chest, no more than a handâ€™s span, two fingers pressing, no more, and felt the tiny spring of it, delicate as a watch spring, felt the movement, small squirms, a faint instinctive strugglingâ€”and felt it fade, that flicker, that tiny spark of life, cried out in anguish and clutched the tiny, doll-like body to my breast, still warm, still warm.

â€œDonâ€™t go,â€ I said, â€œdonâ€™t go, donâ€™t go, please donâ€™t go.â€ But the vibrancy faded, a small blue glow that seemed to light the palms of my hands for an instant, then dwindle like a candle flame, to the coal of a smoldering wick, to the faintest trace of brightnessâ€”then everything was dark.

I was still sitting in the brilliant sun, crying and blood-soaked, the body of the little boy in my lap, the butchered corpse of my Malva beside me, when they found me.

THE STOLEN BRIDE




A WEEK PASSED AFTER MALVAâ€™S DEATH, and there was no slightest hint of who had killed her. Whispering, sidelong glances, and a palpable fog of suspicion hung about the Ridge, but despite Jamieâ€™s every effort, no one could be located who knewâ€”or would sayâ€”anything at all useful.

I could see the tension and frustration building up in Jamie, day by day, and knew it must find an outlet. I had no idea what he might do, though.

After breakfast on the Wednesday, Jamie stood glowering at the window in his study, then slammed down his fist on the table, with a suddenness that made me jump.

â€œI have reached the mortal limit of endurance,â€ he informed me. â€œOne moment more of this, and I shall run mad. I must do something, and I will.â€ Without waiting for any response to this statement, he strode to the office door, flung it open, and bellowed, â€œJoseph!â€ into the hall.

Mr. Wemyss appeared out of the kitchen, where he had been sweeping the chimney at Mrs. Bugâ€™s direction, looking startled, pale, soot-smudged, and generally unkempt.

Jamie ignored the black footprints on the study floorâ€”he had burned the rugâ€”and fixed Mr. Wemyss with a commanding gaze.

â€œDâ€™ye want that woman?â€ he demanded.

â€œWoman?â€ Mr. Wemyss was understandably bewildered. â€œWhatâ€”oh. Are youâ€”might you be referring to Fraulein Berrisch?â€

â€œWho else? Dâ€™ye want her?â€ Jamie repeated.

It had plainly been a long time since anyone had asked Mr. Wemyss what he wanted, and it took him some time to gather his wits from the shock of it.

Brutal prodding by Jamie forced him past deprecating murmurs about the Frauleinâ€™s friends no doubt being the best judge of her happiness, his own unsuitability, poverty, and general unworthiness as a husband, and intoâ€”at long lastâ€”a reckless admission that, well, if the Fraulein should not be terribly averse to the prospect, perhaps . . . well . . . in a word . . .

â€œAye, sir,â€ he said, looking terrified at his own boldness. â€œI do. Very much!â€ he blurted.

â€œGood.â€ Jamie nodded, pleased. â€œWeâ€™ll go and get her, then.â€

Mr. Wemyss was open-mouthed with astonishment; so was I. Jamie swung round to me, issuing orders with the confidence and joie de vivre of a sea-captain with a fat prize in view.

â€œGo and find Young Ian for me, will ye, Sassenach? And tell Mrs. Bug to put up food, enough for a weekâ€™s travel for four men. And then fetch Roger Mac; weâ€™ll need a minister.â€

He rubbed his hands together in satisfaction, then clapped Mr. Wemyss on the shoulder, causing a small puff of soot to rise from his clothes.

â€œGo fettle yourself, Joseph,â€ he said. â€œAnd comb your hair. Weâ€™re going to go and steal ye a bride.â€



â€œ. . . AND PUT A PISTOL TO his breest, his breest,â€ Young Ian chanted, â€œMarry me, marry me, minister, or else Iâ€™ll be your priest, your priestâ€”or else Iâ€™ll be your priest!â€

â€œOf course,â€ Roger said, dropping the song, in which a bold young man named Willie rides with his friends to abduct and forcibly marry a young woman who proves bolder yet, â€œweâ€™ll hope ye prove a wee bit more capable than Willie upon the night, aye, Joseph?â€

Mr. Wemyss, scrubbed, dressed, and fairly vibrating with excitement, gave him a glance of complete incomprehension. Roger grinned, tightening the strap of his saddlebag.

â€œYoung Willie obliges a minister to marry him to the young woman at gunpoint,â€ he explained to Mr. Wemyss, â€œbut then, when he takes his stolen bride to bed, sheâ€™ll have none of himâ€”and his best efforts will not avail to force her.â€

â€œAnd so return me, Willie, to my hame, as virgin as I came, I cameâ€”as virgin as I came!â€ Ian caroled.

â€œNow, mind,â€ Roger said warningly to Jamie, who was heaving his own saddlebags over Gideonâ€™s back. â€œIf the Fraulein is at all unwilling . . .â€

â€œWhat, unwilling to be wed to Joseph?â€ Jamie clapped Mr. Wemyss on the back, then bent to give him a foot up and fairly heaved the smaller man into the saddle. â€œI canna see any woman of sense turning from such an opportunity, can you, a charaid?â€

He took a quick look round the clearing, to see all was well, then ran up the steps and kissed me in quick farewell, before running down again to mount Gideon, who for once seemed amenable and made no effort to bite him.

â€œKeep well, mo nighean donn,â€ he said, smiling into my eyes. And then they were gone, thundering out of the clearing like a gang of Highland raiders, Ianâ€™s ear-splitting whoops ringing from the trees.



ODDLY ENOUGH, the departure of the men seemed to ease things slightly. The talk, of course, went merrily onâ€”but without Jamie or Ian there to serve as a lightning-rod, it merely crackled to and fro like St. Elmoâ€™s fire; spitting, fizzing, and making everyoneâ€™s hair stand on end, but essentially a harmless phenomenon, unless touched directly.

The house felt less an embattled fortress, and more the eye of a storm.

Also, with Mr. Wemyss out of the house, Lizzie came to visit, bringing little Rodney Joseph, as the baby was calledâ€”Roger having set his face firmly against the young fathersâ€™ enthusiastic suggestions of Tilgath-pileser and Ichabod. Wee Rogerina had come out of it all right, being now commonly known as Rory, but Roger declined entirely to hear of a child being christened anything that might result in his being known to the world at large as Icky.

Rodney seemed a very congenial child, in part because he had never quite lost that air of round-eyed astonishment that made him seem agog to hear what you had to say. Lizzieâ€™s astonishment at his birth had mutated into an enchantment that might have completely eclipsed Jo and Kezzie, were it not for the fact that they shared it.

Either one of them wouldâ€”unless forcibly stoppedâ€”spend half an hour discussing Rodneyâ€™s bowel habits with the intensity heretofore reserved for new snares and the peculiar things found inside the stomachs of animals they had killed. Pigs, it seemed, really would eat anything; so would Rodney.

A few days after the menâ€™s departure on their bride-stealing expedition, Brianna had come up from her cabin with Jemmy to visit, and Lizzie likewise had brought Rodney. The two of them joined Amy McCallum and me in the kitchen, where we were spending a pleasant evening sewing by the light of the fire, admiring Rodney, keeping a negligent eye on Jemmy and Aidanâ€”and after a certain amount of cautious exploration, devoting ourselves wholeheartedly to a rundown of the male population of the Ridge, viewed in the light of suspects.

I, of course, had a more personal and painful interest in the topic, but all three of the young women were solidly on the side of justiceâ€”i.e., the side that refused even to contemplate the notion that either Jamie or I might have had anything to do with the murder of Malva Christie.

For myself, I found such open speculation rather a comfort. I had, of course, been engaging in private conjecture nonstopâ€”and an exhausting business it was, too. Not only was it unpleasant to visualize every man I knew in the role of cold-blooded murdererâ€”the process obliged me continuously to reimagine the murder itself, and relive the moment when I had found her.

â€œIâ€™d really hate to think it might have been Bobby,â€ Bree said, frowning as she pushed a wooden darning egg into the heel of a sock. â€œHe seems just such a nice boy.â€

Lizzie drew down her chin at this, pursing her lips.

â€œOh, aye, heâ€™s a sweet lad,â€ she said. â€œBut what ye might call warm-blooded.â€

All of us looked at her.

â€œWell,â€ she said mildly, â€œI didna let him, but he tried hard enough. And when I said no, he did go off and kick a tree.â€

â€œMy husband would do that sometimes, if I refused him,â€ Amy said, thoughtful. â€œBut Iâ€™m sure he wouldna have cut my throat.â€

â€œWell, but Malva didnâ€™t refuse whoever it was,â€ Bree pointed out, squinting as she threaded her darning needle. â€œThat was the problem. He killed her because she was pregnant, and he was afraid sheâ€™d tell everyone.â€

â€œHo!â€ Lizzie said, triumphant. â€œWell, thenâ€”it canna have been Bobby at all, can it? For when my Da turned him awaâ€™â€”â€ A brief shadow crossed her face at mention of her father, who still had not spoken a word to her nor acknowledged the birth of little Rodney. â€œDid he not think of speiring for Malva Christie? Ian said he meant to. And if she were with child by himâ€”well, then, her father would be obliged to agree, would he not?â€

Amy nodded, finding this convincing, but Bree had objections.

â€œYesâ€”but she was insisting that it wasnâ€™t his baby. And he threw up in the blackberry bushes when he heard that she wasâ€â€”her lips compressed momentarilyâ€”â€œwell, he wasnâ€™t happy at all. So he might have killed her out of jealousy, donâ€™t you think?â€

Lizzie and Amy hmmâ€™d dubiously at thisâ€”both of them were fond of Bobbyâ€”but were obliged to admit the possibility.

â€œWhat I wonder about,â€ I said a little hesitantly, â€œis the older men. The married ones. Everyone knows about the young men who were interested in herâ€”but Iâ€™ve certainly seen more than one married man glance at her in passing.â€

â€œI nominate Hiram Crombie,â€ Bree said at once, stabbing her needle into the heel of the sock. Everyone laughed, but she shook her head.

â€œNo, Iâ€™m serious. Itâ€™s always the really religious, very uptight ones that turn out to have secret drawers full of womenâ€™s underwear, and slink around molesting choirboys.â€

Amyâ€™s jaw dropped.

â€œDrawers full of womenâ€™s underwear?â€ she said. â€œWhat . . . shifts and stays? Whatever would he do wiâ€™ them?â€

Brianna flushed at that, having forgotten her audience. She coughed, but there was no good way out.

â€œEr . . . well. I was thinking more of French womenâ€™s underwear,â€ she said weakly. â€œUm . . . lacy sorts of things.â€

â€œOh, French,â€ Lizzie said, nodding wisely. Everyone knew about the notorious reputation of French ladiesâ€”though I doubted that any woman on Fraserâ€™s Ridge save myself had ever seen one. In the interests of covering Breeâ€™s lapse, though, I obligingly told them about La NestlÃ©, the King of Franceâ€™s mistress, who had had her nipples pierced and appeared at court with her breasts exposed, sporting gold hoops through them.

â€œAnother few months oâ€™ this,â€ Lizzie said darkly, looking down at Rodney, who was nursing fiercely at her breast, tiny fists clenched with effort, â€œand I shall be able to do the same. Iâ€™ll tell Jo and Kezzie to fetch me back some hoops when they sell their hides, aye?â€

In the midst of the laughter at this, the sound of a knock at the front door passed unnoticedâ€”or would have, if not for Jemmy and Aidan, who had been playing in Jamieâ€™s study, rushing into the kitchen to tell us about it.

â€œIâ€™ll get it.â€ Bree set down her darning, but I was already on my feet.

â€œNo, Iâ€™ll go.â€ I waved her back, picked up a candlestick, and went down the dark hallway, heart beating fast. Visitors after dark were almost always an emergency of one kind or another.

So was this one, though not any kind I might have expected. For a moment, I didnâ€™t even recognize the tall woman who stood swaying on the stoop, white-faced and gaunt. Then she whispered, â€œFrau Fraser? I mayâ€”may I komm?â€ and fell into my arms.

The noise of it brought all the young women rushing to help, and we had Monika Berrischâ€”for it was indeed Mr. Wemyssâ€™s putative brideâ€”laid on the settle, covered with quilts, and plied with hot toddy in nothing flat.

She recovered quicklyâ€”there was nothing wrong with her, really, save exhaustion and hungerâ€”she said she hadnâ€™t eaten in three daysâ€”and within a short time, was able to sit up eating soup, and explain her astonishing presence.

â€œIt wass my husbandâ€™s sister,â€ she said, closing her eyes in momentary bliss at the aroma of split-pea soup with ham. â€œShe did not want me, effer, and when her husband had the bad accident and lost his wagon, so there was not so much money to keep us all, she did not want me more.â€

She had, she said, yearned for Joseph, but had not had either the strength nor yet the means to withstand her familyâ€™s opposition and insist upon returning to him.

â€œOh?â€ Lizzie was examining her in a close, but not unfriendly manner. â€œWhat happpened, then?â€

Fraulein Berrisch turned large, gentle eyes on her.

â€œI could not bear it more,â€ she said simply. â€œI wish so much to be with Joseph. My husbandâ€™s sister, she wish me to be gone, so she will give a small bit of money. So I came,â€ she concluded, with a shrug, and took another small, greedy spoonful of soup.

â€œYou . . . walked?â€ Brianna said. â€œFrom Halifax?â€

Fraulein Berrisch nodded, licking the spoon, and put out a foot from under the quilts. Her shoes had worn entirely through at the sole; she had wrapped them with random scraps of leather and strips of fabric torn from her shift, so her feet looked like bundles of filthy rags.

â€œElizabeth,â€ she said, looking earnestly at Lizzie. â€œI hope you do not mind I komm. Your fatherâ€”he is hier? I hope so much he does not mind, too.â€

â€œUmm, no,â€ I said, exchanging a glance with Lizzie. â€œHe isnâ€™t hereâ€”but Iâ€™m sure that heâ€™ll be delighted to see you!â€

â€œOh?â€ Her gaunt face, which had shown alarm at hearing that Mr. Wemyss was not here, grew radiant when we told her where he was.

â€œOh,â€ she breathed, clasping the spoon to her bosom as though it were Mr. Wemyssâ€™s head. â€œOh, mein Kavalier!â€ Beaming with joy, she looked round at all of usâ€”and for the first time, noticed Rodney, snoozing in his basket at Lizzieâ€™s feet.

â€œBut who is this?â€ she cried, and leaned forward to look at him. Not quite asleep, Rodney opened round, dark eyes and regarded her with a solemn, sleepy interest.

â€œThis is my wee bairnie. Rodney Joseph, heâ€™s calledâ€”for my Da, ken?â€ Lizzie hoisted him out of his basket, chubby knees pulled up under his chin, and laid him gently in Monikaâ€™s arms.

She cooed over him in German, face alight.

â€œGranny lust,â€ Bree muttered to me, out of the side of her mouth, and I felt laughter bubble up under my stays. I hadnâ€™t laughed since before Malvaâ€™s death, and found it balm to the spirit.

Lizzie was explaining earnestly to Monika the estrangement resulting from her unorthodox marriage, to which Monika was nodding, clicking her tongue in sympathetic understandingâ€”and I did wonder how much of it she graspedâ€”and talking baby-talk to Rodney all at once.

â€œFat chance of Mr. Wemyss staying estranged,â€ I said out of the side of my own mouth. â€œKeep his new wife from her new grandson? Ha!â€

â€œYes, whatâ€™s a little matter of dual sons-in-law?â€ Bree agreed.

Amy was regarding the tender scene with a slight sense of wistfulness. She reached out and put an arm round Aidanâ€™s skinny shoulders.

â€œWell, they do say, the more, the merrier,â€ she said.

PRIORITIES




THREE SHIRTS, AN EXTRA PAIR of decent breeches, two pair of stockings, one lisle, one silkâ€”wait, where were the silk ones?

Brianna stepped to the door and called to her husband, who was industriously laying segments of clay pipe into the trench he had dug, assisted by Jemmy and Aidan.

â€œRoger! What have you done with your silk stockings?â€

He paused, frowning, and rubbed his head. Then, handing the shovel to Aidan, he came across to the house, leaping over the open trench.

â€œI wore them last Sunday to preach, no?â€ he asked, reaching her. â€œWhat did I . . . oh.â€

â€œOh?â€ she said suspiciously, seeing his face change from puzzlement to guilt. â€œWhatâ€™s â€˜ohâ€™?â€

â€œAhh . . . well, youâ€™d stayed to home with Jem and his stomachacheâ€â€”a tactically helpful ailment, greatly exaggerated in order to keep her from having to sit through two hours of staring and whisperingâ€”â€œso when Jocky Abernathy asked me would I care to go fishing with him . . .â€

â€œRoger MacKenzie,â€ she said, fixing him with a look of wrath, â€œif you put your good silk stockings in a creel full of smelly fish and forgot themâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™ll just nip up to the house and borrow a pair from your Da, shall I?â€ he said hurriedly. â€œIâ€™m sure mine will turn up, somewhere.â€

â€œSo will your head,â€ she said. â€œProbably under a rock!â€

That made him laugh, which was not what she had intended, but which had the effect of easing her temper.

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ he said, leaning forward to kiss her forehead. â€œItâ€™s probably Freudian.â€

â€œOh? And what does leaving your stockings wrapped around a dead trout symbolize?â€ she demanded.

â€œGeneralized guilt and divided loyalties, I imagine,â€ he said, still joking, but not so much. â€œBreeâ€”Iâ€™ve been thinking. I really donâ€™t think I should go. I donâ€™t need toâ€”â€

â€œYes, you do,â€ she said, as firmly as possible. â€œDa says so, Mama says so, and so do I.â€

â€œOh, well, then.â€ He smiled, but she could see the uneasiness under his humorâ€”the more so because she shared it. Malva Christieâ€™s murder had caused an uproar on the Ridgeâ€”alarm, hysteria, suspicion, and finger-pointing in every direction. Several young menâ€”Bobby Higgins among themâ€”had simply disappeared from the Ridge, whether from a sense of guilt, or merely from a sense of self-preservation.

There had been accusations enough to go around; even she herself had come in for her share of gossip and suspicion, some of her unguarded remarks about Malva Christie having been repeated. But by far the greatest weight of suspicion rested squarely on her parents.

Both of them were doing their best to go about their daily business, grimly ignoring the gossip and the pointed looksâ€”but it was getting harder; anyone could see that.

Roger had gone at once to visit the Christiesâ€”had gone every day since Malvaâ€™s death save for his hasty expedition to Halifaxâ€”had buried the girl with simplicity and tearsâ€”and had since worn himself out with being reasonable and soothing and firm to everyone else on the Ridge. He had immediately put aside his plan to go to Edenton for ordination, but Jamie, hearing of it, had insisted.

â€œYouâ€™ve done everything here you could possibly do,â€ Brianna said, for the hundredth time. â€œThereâ€™s nothing else you can do to helpâ€”and it might be years before you have another chance.â€

She knew how urgently he wished to be ordained, and would have done anything to further that wish. For herself, she wished that she could see it; but without a great deal of talk, they had agreed that it was best for her and Jem to go to River Run, and wait there for Roger to make the trip to Edenton and then return. It couldnâ€™t do a candidate for ordination any good to turn up with a Catholic wife and child.

The guilt of leaving, though, with her parents standing in the eye of the whirlwind . . .

â€œYou have to go,â€ she repeated. â€œBut maybe Iâ€”â€

He stopped her with a look.

â€œNo, weâ€™ve done that.â€ His argument was that her presence couldnâ€™t affect public opinion, which was probably true. She realized that his real reasonâ€”shared by her parentsâ€”was a desire to get her and Jem away from the situation on the Ridge, out of the uproar and safe, preferably before Jem realized that a good many of the neighbors thought that one, if not both, of his grandparents was a cold-blooded murderer.

And, to her private shame, she was eager to go.

Someone had killed Malvaâ€”and her baby. Every time she thought of it, the possibilities swam before her, the litany of names. And every time, she was forced to see her cousinâ€™s name among them. Ian had not run away, and she couldnâ€™tâ€”could notâ€”think that it had been him. And yet every day she was obliged to see Ian, and to contemplate the possibility.

She stood staring into the bag she was packing, folding and refolding the shirt in her hands, looking for reasons to go, reasons to stayâ€”and knowing that no reason had any power at all, not now.

A dull thunk! from outside jerked her from her mire of indecision.

â€œWhatâ€”â€ She reached the door in two steps, fast enough to see Jem and Aidan disappearing into the woods like a pair of rabbits. On the edge of the trench lay the cracked pieces of the pipe segment they had just dropped.

â€œYou little snot-rags!â€ she bellowed, and grabbed for a broomâ€”intending what she didnâ€™t know, but violence seemed the only outlet for the frustration that had just erupted like a volcano, searing through her.

â€œBree,â€ Roger said softly, and put a hand on her back. â€œItâ€™s not important.â€

She jerked away and rounded on him, the blood roaring in her ears.

â€œDo you have any idea how long it takes to make one of those? How many firings it takes to get one thatâ€™s not cracked? Howâ€”â€

â€œYes, I do know,â€ he said, his voice level. â€œAnd itâ€™s still not important.â€

She stood trembling, breathing hard. Very gently, he reached out and took the broom from her, standing it neatly back in its place.

â€œI needâ€”to go,â€ she said, when she could form words again, and he nodded, his eyes tinged with the sadness he had carried ever since the day of Malvaâ€™s death.

â€œAye, ye do,â€ he said quietly.

He came behind her, put his arms around her, his chin resting on her shoulder, and gradually she stopped shaking. Across the clearing, she saw Mrs. Bug come down the path from the garden with an apron full of cabbages and carrots; Claire had not set foot in her garden since . . .

â€œWill they be all right?â€

â€œWeâ€™ll pray that they will,â€ he said, and tightened his arms around her. She was comforted by his touch, and didnâ€™t notice until later that he had not in fact reassured her that they would.

JUSTICE IS MINE,

SAYETH THE LORD




I POKED AT THE LAST PACKAGE from Lord John, trying to work up enough enthusiasm to open it. It was a small wooden crate; perhaps more vitriol. I supposed I should make a fresh batch of etherâ€”but then, what was the point? People had stopped coming to my surgery, even for the treatment of minor cuts and bruises, let alone the odd appendectomy.

I ran a finger through the dust on the counter, and thought that I should at least take care of that; Mrs. Bug kept the rest of the house spotless, but wouldnâ€™t come into the surgery. I added dusting to the long list of things that I should do, but made no move to go and find a dust cloth.

Sighing, I got up and went across the hall. Jamie was sitting at his desk, twiddling a quill and staring at a half-finished letter. He put down the quill when he saw me, smiling.

â€œHow is it, Sassenach?â€

â€œAll right,â€ I said, and he nodded, accepting it at face value. His face showed the lines of strain, and I knew that he was no more all right than I was. â€œI havenâ€™t seen Ian all day. Did he say he was going?â€ To the Cherokee, I meant. Little wonder if he wanted to get away from the Ridge; I thought it had taken a good deal of fortitude for him to stay as long as he had, bearing the stares and murmursâ€”and the outright accusations.

Jamie nodded again, and dropped the quill back into its jar.

â€œAye, I told him to go. No purpose to him staying any longer; thereâ€™d only be more fights.â€ Ian didnâ€™t say anything about the fights, but had more than once turned up to supper with the marks of battle on him.

â€œRight. Well, Iâ€™d better tell Mrs. Bug before she starts the supper.â€ Still, I made no motion to get up, finding some small sense of comfort in Jamieâ€™s presence, some surcease from the constant memory of the small, bloody weight in my lap, inert as a lump of meatâ€”and the sight of Malvaâ€™s eyes, so surprised.

I heard horses in the yard, several of them. I glanced at Jamie, who shook his head, brows raised, then rose to go and meet the visitors, whoever they were. I followed him down the hall, wiping my hands on my apron and mentally revising the supper menu to accommodate what sounded like at least a dozen guests, from the whickering and murmuring I heard in the dooryard.

Jamie opened the door, and stopped dead. I looked over his shoulder, and felt terror seize me. Horsemen, black against the sinking sun, and in that moment, I was back in the whisky clearing, damp with sweat and clad in nothing but my shift. Jamie heard my gasp, and put back a hand, to keep me away.

â€œWhat dâ€™ye want, Brown?â€ he said, sounding most unfriendly.

â€œWeâ€™ve come for your wife,â€ said Richard Brown. There was an unmistakable note of gloating in his voice, and hearing it, the down hairs on my body rippled with cold, and black spots floated in my field of vision. I stepped back, hardly feeling my feet, and took hold of the doorjamb to my surgery, clinging to it for support.

â€œWell, ye can just be on your way, then,â€ Jamie replied, with the same unfriendly tone. â€œYeâ€™ve nothing to do with my wife, nor she with you.â€

â€œAh, now, there youâ€™re wrong, Mister Fraser.â€ My vision had cleared, and I saw him urge his horse up closer to the stoop. He leaned down, peering through the door, and evidently saw me, for he smiled, in a most unpleasant fashion.

â€œWeâ€™ve come to arrest your wife, for the dastard crime of murder.â€

Jamieâ€™s hand tensed where he gripped the door, and he drew himself slowly to his fullest height, seeming to expand as he did so.

â€œYeâ€™ll leave my land, sir,â€ he said, and his voice had dropped to a level just above the rustlings of horses and harness. â€œAnd yeâ€™ll go now.â€

I felt, rather than heard, footsteps behind me. Mrs. Bug, coming to see what was afoot.

â€œBride save us,â€ she whispered, seeing the men. Then she was gone, running back through the house, light-footed as a deer. I should follow her, I knew, escape through the back door, run up into the forest, hide. But my limbs were frozen. I could barely breathe, let alone move.

And Richard Brown was looking at me over Jamieâ€™s shoulder, open dislike mingling with triumph.

â€œOh, weâ€™ll leave,â€ he said, straightening up. â€œHand her over, and weâ€™ll be gone. Vanished like the morning dew,â€ he said, and laughed. Dimly, I wondered whether he was drunk.

â€œBy what right do you come here?â€ Jamie demanded. His left hand rose, rested on the hilt of his dirk in plain threat. The sight of it galvanized me, finally, and I stumbled down the hall, toward the kitchen where the guns were kept.

â€œ. . . Committee of Safety.â€ I caught those words in Brownâ€™s voice, raised in threat, and then was through into the kitchen. I grabbed the fowling piece from its hooks above the hearth, and wrenching open the drawer of the sideboard, hastily bundled the three pistols there into the large pockets of my surgical apron, made to hold instruments while I worked.

My hands were shaking. I hesitatedâ€”the pistols were primed and loaded; Jamie checked them every nightâ€”should I take the shot pouch, the powder horn? No time. I heard Jamieâ€™s voice and Richard Brownâ€™s, shouting now at the front of the house.

The sound of the back door opening jerked my head up, and I saw an unfamiliar man pause in the doorway, looking round. He saw me and started toward me, grinning, hand out to seize my arm.

I lifted a pistol from my apron and shot him, point-blank. The grin didnâ€™t leave his face, but took on a slightly puzzled air. He blinked once or twice, then put a hand to his side, where a reddening spot was beginning to spread on his shirt. He looked at his blood-smeared fingers, and his jaw dropped.

â€œWell, goddamn!â€ he said. â€œYou shot me!â€

â€œI did,â€ I said, breathless. â€œAnd Iâ€™ll bloody do it again, if you donâ€™t get out of here!â€ I dropped the empty pistol on the floor with a crash, and scrabbled one-handed in my apron pocket for another, still holding the fowling piece in a death grip.

He didnâ€™t wait to see if I meant it, but whirled and crashed into the door frame, then stumbled through it, leaving a smear of blood on the wood.

Wisps of black-powder smoke floated in the air, mingling oddly with the scent of roasting fish, and I thought for an instant that I might throw up, but managed despite my nausea to set down the fowling piece for a moment and bar the door, my hands shaking so that it took several tries.

Sudden sounds from the front of the house drove nerves and everything else from my mind, and I was running down the hall, gun in hand, before I had made a conscious decision to move, the heavy pistols in my apron banging against my thighs.

Theyâ€™d dragged Jamie off the porch; I caught a brief glimpse of him in the midst of a surging melee of bodies. Theyâ€™d stopped shouting. There wasnâ€™t any noise at all, save for small grunts and the impact of flesh, the scuffling of myriad feet in the dust. It was deadly earnest, that struggle, and I knew at once that they meant to kill him.

I leveled the fowling piece at the edge of the crowd farthest from Jamie, and pulled the trigger. The crash of the gun and the startled screams seemed to come together, and the scene before me flew apart, the knot of men dissolving, peppered with bird shot. Jamie had kept hold of his dirk; with a little room around him now, I saw him drive it into one manâ€™s side, wrench it back and lash sideways in the same motion, scoring a bloody furrow across the forehead of a man who had fallen back a little.

Then I caught a glimpse of metal to one side and by reflex shrieked â€œDUCK!â€ an instant before Brownâ€™s pistol fired. There was a small tchoong past my ear, and I realized, in a very calm sort of way, that Brown had fired at me, not Jamie.

Jamie had, however, ducked. So had everyone else in the yard, and men were now scrambling to their feet, confused, the impetus of the attack dispersed. Jamie had dived toward the porch; he was up and stumbling toward me, striking viciously with the hilt of his dirk at a man who grabbed at his sleeve, so the man fell back with a cry.

We might have rehearsed it a dozen times. He took the steps of the porch in one leap and flung himself into me, carrying us both through the door, then spun on his heel and slammed the door, throwing himself against it and holding it against the frenzied impact of bodies for the instant it took me to drop the fowling piece, seize the bolt, and lift it into place.

It fell into its hooks with a thunk.

The door vibrated to the blows of fists and shoulders, and the shouting had started up again, but with a different sound. No gloating, no taunting. Cursing still, but with a set, malign intent.

Neither of us paused to listen.

â€œI barred the kitchen door,â€ I gasped, and Jamie nodded, diving into my surgery to secure the bolts of the inside shutters there. I heard the crash of breaking glass in the surgery behind me as I ran into his study; the windows there were smaller, and not glass, placed high in the wall. I slammed the shutters to and bolted them, then ran back into the suddenly darkened hallway to find the gun.

Jamie had it already; he was in the kitchen, grabbing things, and as I started toward the kitchen door, he came out of it, hung about with shot pouches, powder horns, and the like, fowling piece in his hand, and with a jerk of the head, motioned me before him up the stairs.

The rooms above were still filled with light; it was like bursting up from underwater, and I gulped the light as though it were air, dazzled and eyes watering as I rushed to bolt the shutters in the boxroom and Amy McCallumâ€™s room. I didnâ€™t know where Amy and her sons were; I could only be grateful that they werenâ€™t in the house at the moment.

I ran into the bedroom, gasping. Jamie was kneeling by the window, methodically loading guns and saying something under his breath in Gaelicâ€”prayer or cursing, I couldnâ€™t tell.

I didnâ€™t ask if he was hurt. His face was bruised, his lip was split, and blood had run down his chin onto his shirt, he was covered with dirt and what I assumed to be smears of other peoplesâ€™ blood, and the ear on the side closest me was swollen. But he was steady in his movements, and anything short of a fractured skull would have to wait.

â€œThey mean to kill us,â€ I said, and didnâ€™t mean it as a question.

He nodded, eyes on his work, then handed me a spare pistol to load.

â€œAye, they do. Good job the weans are all safe away, isnâ€™t it?â€ He smiled at me suddenly, bloody-toothed and fierce, and I felt steadier than I had for a long time.

Heâ€™d left one side of the shutter ajar. I moved carefully back behind him and peered out, the loaded pistol primed and in my hand.

â€œNo bodies lying in the dooryard,â€ I reported. â€œI suppose you didnâ€™t kill any of them.â€

â€œNot for want of trying,â€ he replied. â€œGod, what Iâ€™d give for a rifle!â€ He rose cautiously to his knees, the barrel of the fowling piece protruding over the sill, and surveyed the state of the attack.

They had withdrawn for the moment; a small group was visible under the chestnut trees at the far side of the clearing, and theyâ€™d taken the horses down toward Bree and Rogerâ€™s cabin, safely out of range of flying bullets. Brown and his minions were clearly planning what to do next.

â€œWhat do you suppose they would have done, if Iâ€™d agreed to go with them?â€ I could feel my heart again, at least. It was going a mile a minute, but I could breathe, and some feeling was coming back into my extremities.

â€œI should never haâ€™ let ye go,â€ he replied shortly.

â€œAnd quite possibly Richard Brown knows that,â€ I said. He nodded; heâ€™d been thinking along the same lines. Brown had never intended actually to arrest me; only to provoke an incident in which we could both be killed under circumstances dubious enough as to prevent wholesale retaliation by Jamieâ€™s tenants.

â€œMrs. Bug got out, did she?â€ he asked.

â€œYes. If they didnâ€™t catch her outside the house.â€ I narrowed my eyes against the brilliant afternoon sun, searching for a short, broad figure in skirts among the group by the chestnut trees, but I saw only men.

Jamie nodded again, hissing gently through his back teeth as he swiveled the gun barrel slowly through an arc that covered the dooryard.

â€œWeâ€™ll see, thenâ€ was all he said. â€œCome that wee bit closer, man,â€ he murmured, as one man started cautiously across the yard toward the house. â€œOne shot; thatâ€™s all I ask. Here, Sassenach, take this.â€ He pushed the fowling piece into my hands, and selected his favorite of the pistols, a long-barreled Highland dag with a scroll butt.

The manâ€”it was Richard Brown, I sawâ€”stopped some distance away, pulled a handkerchief from the waist of his breeches, and waved it slowly overhead. Jamie snorted briefly, but let him come on.

â€œFraser!â€ he called, coming to a stop at a distance of forty yards or so. â€œFraser! Dâ€™ye hear me?â€

Jamie sighted carefully and fired. The ball struck the ground a few feet in front of Brown, raising a sudden puff of dust from the path, and Brown leapt in the air as though stung by a bee.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with you?â€ he yelled indignantly. â€œHave ye never heard of a flag oâ€™ truce, you horse-stealinâ€™ Scotcher?â€

â€œIf I wanted ye dead, Brown, yeâ€™d be coolinâ€™ this minute!â€ Jamie shouted back. â€œSpeak your piece.â€ What he did want was plain: he wanted them wary of coming closer to the house; it was impossible to hit anything accurately with a pistol at forty yards, and not that easy with a musket.

â€œYou know what I want!â€ Brown called. He took off his hat, wiping sweat and dirt from his face. â€œI want that goddamn murderous witch of yours.â€

The answer to that was another carefully aimed pistol ball. Brown jumped again, but not so high.

â€œLook you,â€ he tried again, with a conciliating note in his voice. â€œWe ainâ€™t going to hurt her. We mean to take her to Hillsboro for trial. A fair trial. Thatâ€™s all.â€

Jamie handed me the second pistol to reload, took another, and fired.

You had to give Brown credit for persistence, I thought. Of course, it had probably dawned on him that Jamie either couldnâ€™t or wouldnâ€™t actually hit him, and he doggedly stood his ground through two more shots, yelling that they meant to take me to Hillsboro, and surely to God if I were innocent, Jamie should want a trial, shouldnâ€™t he?

It was hot upstairs, and sweat was trickling down between my breasts. I blotted the fabric of my shift against my chest.

With no answer save the whine of pistol balls, Brown threw up his hands in exaggerated pantomime of a reasonable man tried beyond endurance, and stamped back to his men beneath the chestnut trees. Nothing had changed, but seeing the narrow back of him made me breathe a little easier.

Jamie was still crouched in the window, pistol at the ready, but seeing Brown go back, he relaxed and sat back on his heels, sighing.

â€œIs there water, Sassenach?â€

â€œYes.â€ The bedroom ewer was full; I poured him a cup and he drank it thirstily. We had food, water, and a fair amount of shot and powder. I did not, however, foresee a long siege ahead.

â€œWhat do you suppose theyâ€™ll do?â€ I didnâ€™t go near the window, but by standing to one side, I could see them clearly, gathered in conference under the trees. The air was still and heavy, and the leaves above them hung like damp rags.

Jamie came to stand behind me, dabbing at his lip with the tail of his shirt.

â€œFire the house as soon as itâ€™s dark, I suppose,â€ he said matter-of-factly. â€œI would. Though I suppose they might try dragginâ€™ Gideon out and threatening to put a ball through his head, and I didna give ye up.â€ He seemed to think this last was a joke, but I failed to see the humor in it.

He saw my face and put a hand behind my back, drawing me close for a moment. The air was hot and sticky, and we were both wringing wet, but the nearness of him was a comfort, nonetheless.

â€œSo,â€ I said, taking a deep breath. â€œIt all depends on whether Mrs. Bug got awayâ€”and who sheâ€™s told.â€

â€œSheâ€™ll haâ€™ gone for Arch, first thing.â€ Jamie patted me gently, and sat down on the bed. â€œIf heâ€™s to home, heâ€™ll run for Kenny Lindsay; heâ€™s nearest. After that . . .â€ He shrugged, and closed his eyes, and I saw that his face was pale under the sunburn and the smears of dirt and blood.

â€œJamieâ€”are you hurt?â€

He opened his eyes and gave me a small, one-sided smile, trying not to stretch his torn lip.

â€œNo, Iâ€™ve broken my bloody finger again, is all.â€ He raised a shoulder in deprecation, but let me lift his right hand to look.

It was a clean break; that was all that could be said for it. The fourth finger was stiff, the joints fused from being so badly broken long ago, in Wentworth Prison. He couldnâ€™t bend it, and it therefore stuck out awkwardly; this wasnâ€™t the first time heâ€™d snapped it.

He swallowed as I felt gently for the break, and closed his eyes again, sweating.

â€œThereâ€™s laudanum in the surgery,â€ I said. â€œOr whisky.â€ I knew he would refuse, though, and he did.

â€œIâ€™ll want a clear head,â€ he said, â€œwhatever happens.â€ He opened his eyes and gave me the ghost of a smile. The room was sweltering and airless, despite the open shutter. The sun was more than halfway down the sky, and the first shadows were gathering in the corners of the room.

I went down to the surgery to fetch a splint and bandage; it wouldnâ€™t help a lot, but it was something to do.

The surgery was dark, with the shutters closed, but with the windows broken, air came through them, making the room seem oddly exposed and vulnerable. I walked in like a mouse, quiet, stopping abruptly, listening for danger, whiskers twitching. Everything was quiet, though.

â€œToo quiet,â€ I said aloud, and laughed. Moving with purpose and ignoring the noise, I set my feet down firmly and opened cupboard doors with abandon, banging instruments and rattling bottles as I looked out what I needed.

I stopped into the kitchen before returning upstairs. Partly to reassure myself that the back door was firmly bolted, and partly to see what bits of food Mrs. Bug might have left out. He hadnâ€™t said so, but I knew the pain of the broken finger was making Jamie mildly nauseatedâ€”and in him, food generally quelled that sort of disturbance, and made him feel more settled.

The cauldron was still over the coals, but the fire, untended, had burned down so far that the soup had luckily not boiled away. I poked up the embers and put on three sticks of fat pine, as much by way of thumbing my nose at the besiegers outside as from the long-ingrained habit of never letting a fire die. Let them see the spray of sparks from the chimney, I thought, and imagine us sitting peacefully down to eat by our hearth. Or better yet, imagine us sitting by the blazing fire, melting lead and molding bullets.

In this defiant frame of mind, I went back upstairs, equipped with medical supplies, an alfresco lunch, and a large bottle of black ale. I couldnâ€™t help but notice, though, the echo of my footsteps on the stair, and the silence that settled quickly back into place behind me, like water when one steps out of it.

I heard a shot, just as I approached the head of the stair, and took the last steps so fast that I tripped and would have fallen headlong, save for reeling into the wall.

Jamie appeared from Mr. Wemyssâ€™s room, fowling piece in hand, looking startled.

â€œAre ye all right, Sassenach?â€

â€œYes,â€ I said crossly, wiping spilled soup off my hand with my apron. â€œWhat in the name of God are you shooting at?â€

â€œNothing. I only wanted to make the point that the back of the house is nay safer than the front, if they thought of creeping up that way. Just to ensure that they do wait for dark to fall.â€

I bound up his finger, which seemed to help a little. The food, as Iâ€™d hoped, helped considerably more. He ate like a wolf, and rather to my surprise, so did I.

â€œThe condemned ate a hearty meal,â€ I observed, picking up crumbs of bread and cheese. â€œIâ€™d always thought being in danger of death would make one too nervous to eat, but apparently not.â€

He shook his head, took a swallow of ale, and passed me the bottle.

â€œA friend once told me, â€˜The body has nay conscience.â€™ I dinna ken that thatâ€™s entirely soâ€”but it is true that the body doesna generally admit the possibility of nonexistence. And if ye existâ€”well, ye need food, thatâ€™s all.â€ He grinned one-sided at me, and tearing the last of the sweet rolls in half, gave one to me.

I took it, but didnâ€™t eat it immediately. There was no sound outside, save the buzzing of cicadas, though the air had a sultry thickness to it that often presaged rain. It was early in the summer for storms, but one could only hope.

â€œYouâ€™ve thought of it, too, havenâ€™t you?â€ I said quietly.

He made no pretense of misunderstanding me.

â€œWell, it is the twenty-first oâ€™ the month,â€ he said.

â€œItâ€™s June, for heavenâ€™s sake! And the wrong year, as well. That newspaper clipping said January, of 1776!â€ I was absurdly indignant, as though I had somehow been cheated.

He found that funny.

â€œI was a printer myself, Sassenach,â€ he said, laughing through a mouthful of sweet roll. â€œYe dinna want to believe everything ye read in the newspapers, aye?â€

When I looked out again, only a few men were visible under the chestnut trees. One of them saw my movement; he waved his arm slowly to and fro above his headâ€”then drew the edge of his hand flat across his throat.

The sun was just above the treetops; two hours, perhaps, to nightfall. Two hours surely was enough time for Mrs. Bug to have summoned help, thoughâ€”always assuming she had found anyone who would come. Arch might have gone to Cross Creekâ€”he went once a month; Kenny might be hunting. As for the newer tenants . . . without Roger to keep them in order, their suspicion and dislike of me had become blatant. I had the feeling that they might come if summonedâ€”but only to cheer as I was dragged away.

If anyone did comeâ€”what then? I didnâ€™t want to be dragged away, much less shot or burnt alive in the ashes of my houseâ€”but I didnâ€™t want anyone else injured or killed in an effort to prevent it, either.

â€œCome away from the window, Sassenach,â€ Jamie said. He held out a hand to me, and I went, sitting on the bed beside him. I felt all at once exhausted, the adrenaline of emergency having burned away, leaving my muscles feeling like heat-softened rubber.

â€œLie down, a Sorcha,â€ he said softly. â€œLay your head in my lap.â€

Hot as it was, I did so, finding it a comfort to stretch out, even more to hear his heart, thumping slow and solid above my ear, and feel his hand, light on my head.

All the weapons were laid out, ranged on the floor beside the window, all loaded, primed, and ready for use. Heâ€™d taken his sword down from the armoire; it stood by the door, a last resort.

â€œThereâ€™s nothing we can do now, is there?â€ I said after a little. â€œNothing but wait.â€

His fingers moved idly through the damp curls of my hair; it fell to just above my shoulders now, long enoughâ€”barelyâ€”to tie back or pin up.

â€œWell, we might say an Act of Contrition,â€ he said. â€œWe did that, always, the night before a battle. Just in case,â€ he added, smiling down at me.

â€œAll right,â€ I said after a pause. â€œJust in case.â€

I reached up and his good hand closed round mine.

â€œMon Dieu, je regrette . . .â€ he began, and I remembered that he said this prayer in French, harking back to those days as a mercenary in France; how often had he said it then, a necessary precaution, cleansing the soul at night in expectation of the possibility of death in the morning?

I said it, too, in English, and we fell silent. The cicadas had stopped. Far, far away, I thought I heard a sound that might be thunder.

â€œDo you know,â€ I said after a long while, â€œIâ€™m sorry for a great many things and people. Rupert, Murtagh, Dougal . . . Frank. Malva,â€ I added softly, with a catch in my throat. â€œBut speaking only for myself . . .â€ I cleared my throat.

â€œI donâ€™t regret anything,â€ I said, watching the shadows creep in from the corners of the room. â€œNot one bloody thing.â€

â€œNor do I, mo nighean donn,â€ he said, and his fingers stilled, warm against my skin. â€œNor do I.â€



I WOKE FROM A DOZE with the smell of smoke in my nostrils. Being in a state of grace is all very well, but I imagine even Joan of Arc had qualms when they lit the first brand. I sat bolt upright, heart pounding, to see Jamie at the window.

It wasnâ€™t quite dark yet; streaks of orange and gold and rose lit the sky to the west, and touched his face with a fiery light. He looked long-nosed and fierce, the lines of strain cut deep.

â€œFolk are coming,â€ he said. His voice was matter-of-fact, but his good hand was clenched hard round the edge of the shutter, as though he would have liked to slam and bolt it.

I came to stand by him, combing my fingers hastily through my hair. I could still make out figures under the chestnut trees, though they now were no more than silhouettes. Theyâ€™d built a bonfire there, at the far edge of the dooryard; thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d smelled. There were more people coming into the dooryard, though; I was sure I made out the squat figure of Mrs. Bug among them. The sound of voices floated up, but they werenâ€™t talking loudly enough to make out words.

â€œWill ye plait my hair, Sassenach? I canna manage, wiâ€™ this.â€ He gave his broken finger a cursory glance.

I lit a candle, and he moved a stool to the window, so he could keep watch while I combed his hair and braided it into a tight, thick queue, which I clubbed at the base of his neck and tied with a neat black ribbon.

I knew his reasons were twofold: not only to appear well-groomed and gentlemanly, but to be ready to fight if he had to. I was less worried about someone seizing me by the hair as I attempted to cleave them in half with a sword, but supposed that if this were my last appearance as the lady of the Ridge, I should not appear unkempt.

I heard him mutter something under his breath, as I brushed my own hair by candlelight, and turned on my stool to look at him.

â€œHiramâ€™s come,â€ he informed me. â€œI hear his voice. Thatâ€™s good.â€

â€œIf you say so,â€ I said dubiously, recollecting Hiram Crombieâ€™s denunciations in church a week beforeâ€”thinly veiled remarks clearly aimed at us. Roger hadnâ€™t mentioned them; Amy McCallum had told me.

Jamie turned his head to look at me, and smiled, an expression of extraordinary sweetness coming over his face.

â€œYeâ€™re verra lovely, Sassenach,â€ he said as though surprised. â€œBut, aye, itâ€™s good. Whatever he thinks, he wouldna countenance Brown hanging us in the dooryard, nor yet setting the house afire to drive us out.â€

There were more voices outside; the crowd was growing quickly.

â€œMr. Fraser!â€

He took a deep breath, took the candle from the table, and threw open the shutter, holding the candle near his face so they could see him.

It was almost full dark, but several of the crowd were holding torches, which gave me uneasy visions of the mob coming to burn Dr. Frankensteinâ€™s monsterâ€”but did at least allow me to make out the faces below. There were at least thirty menâ€”and not a few womenâ€”there, in addition to Brown and his thugs. Hiram Crombie was indeed there, standing beside Richard Brown, and looking like something out of the Old Testament.

â€œWe require ye to come down, Mr. Fraser,â€ he called. â€œAnd your wifeâ€”if ye please.â€

I caught sight of Mrs. Bug, plump and clearly terrified, her face streaked with tears. Then Jamie closed the shutters, gently, and offered me his arm.



JAMIE HAD WORN BOTH dirk and sword, and had not changed his clothes. He stood on the porch, bloodstained and battered, and dared them to harm us further.

â€œYeâ€™ll take my wife over my dead body,â€ he said, raising his powerful voice enough to be heard across the clearing. I was rather afraid they would. Heâ€™d been rightâ€”so farâ€”about Hiram not countenancing lynching, but it was clear that public opinion was not in our favor.

â€œThou shalt not suffer a witch to live!â€ someone shouted from the back of the crowd, and a stone whistled through the air, bouncing off the front of the house with a sharp report, like a gunshot. It struck no more than a foot from my head, and I flinched, instantly regretting it.

Angry murmurs had risen from the moment Jamie had opened the door, and this encouraged them. There were shouts of â€œMurderers!â€ and â€œHeartless! Heartless!â€ and a number of Gaelic insults that I didnâ€™t try to understand.

â€œIf she didnâ€™t do it, breugaire, who did?â€ someone bellowed. â€œLiarâ€ it meant.

The man Jamie had slashed across the face with his dirk was in the forefront of the crowd; the open wound gaped, still oozing, and his face was a mask of dried blood.

â€œIf â€™twasnâ€™t her, â€™twas him!â€ he shouted, pointing at Jamie. â€œFear-siÃ»rsachd!â€ Lecher.

There was an ugly rumble of agreement at that, and I saw Jamie shift his weight and set his hand to his sword, ready to draw if they charged him.

â€œBe still!â€ Hiramâ€™s voice was rather shrill, but penetrating. â€œBe still, I tell ye!â€ He pushed Brown aside and came up the steps, very deliberately. At the top, he gave me a look of revulsion, but then turned to the crowd.

â€œJustice!â€ one of Brownâ€™s men yelled, before he could speak. â€œWe want justice!â€

â€œAye, we do!â€ Hiram shouted back. â€œAnd justice we shall have, for the puir raped lass and her bairn unborn!â€

A satisfied growl greeted this, and icy terror ran down my legs, so that I feared my knees would give way.

â€œJustice! Justice!â€ Various people were taking up the chant, but Hiram stopped them, raising both hands as though he were bloody Moses parting the Red Sea.

â€œJustice is mine, sayeth the Lord,â€ Jamie remarked, in a voice just loud enough to be generally heard. Hiram, who had evidently been about to say the same thing, gave him a furious look, but couldnâ€™t very well contradict him.

â€œAnd justice youâ€™ll have, Mister Fraser!â€ Brown said very loudly. He lifted his face, narrow-eyed and malicious with triumph. â€œI wish to take her for trial. Anyone accused is entitled to that, nay? If she is innocentâ€”if you are innocentâ€”how can you refuse?â€

â€œCertainly a point,â€ Hiram observed, very dry. â€œIf your wife be clean oâ€™ the crime, sheâ€™s naught to fear. How say ye, sir?â€

â€œI say that should I surrender her to the hands of this man, she willna live to stand a trial,â€ Jamie replied hotly. â€œHe holds me to blame for the death of his brotherâ€”and some of ye here will ken well enough the truth oâ€™ that affair!â€ he added, lifting his chin to the crowd.

Here and there, heads noddedâ€”but they were few. No more than a dozen of his Ardsmuir men had been on the expedition that rescued me; in the wake of gossip following it, many of the new tenants would have known only that I had been abducted, assaulted in some scandalous fashion, and that men had died on my account. The mind of the times being what it was, I was well aware that an obscure sense of blame attached to the victim of any sexual crimeâ€”unless the woman died, in which case she became at once a spotless angel.

â€œHe will slaughter her out of hand, for the sake of revenge upon me,â€ Jamie said, raising his voice. He changed abruptly to Gaelic, pointing at Brown. â€œLook at yon man, and see the truth of the matter writ upon his face! He has no more to do with justice than with honor, and he would not recognize honor by the smell of its arse!â€

That made a few of them laugh, in sheer surprise. Brown, disconcerted, looked round to see what they were laughing at, which made more of them laugh.

The mood of the assembly was still against us, but they were not yet with Brownâ€”who was, after all, a stranger. Hiramâ€™s narrow brow creased in consideration.

â€œWhat would ye offer by way of guarantee for the womanâ€™s safety?â€ Hiram asked Brown.

â€œA dozen hogsheads of beer and three dozen prime hides,â€ Brown replied promptly. â€œFour dozen!â€ His eagerness gleamed in his eyes, and it was all he could do to keep his voice from shaking with the lust to take me. I had a sudden, unpleasant conviction that while my death was his ultimate goal, he didnâ€™t intend that it should be a quick one, unless circumstances demanded it.

â€œIt would be worth far more than that to ye, breugaire, to have your revenge upon me with her death,â€ Jamie said evenly.

Hiram glanced from one to the other, unsure what to do. I looked out into the crowd, keeping my face impassive. In truth, it was not difficult to do; I felt completely numb.

There were a few friendly faces, glancing anxiously to Jamie, to see what to do. Kenny and his brothers, Murdo and Evan, stood in a tight group, hands on their dirks and faces set. I didnâ€™t know whether Richard Brown had chosen his timing, or merely been lucky. Ian was gone, hunting with his Cherokee friends. Arch was plainly gone, as well, or he would be visibleâ€”Arch and his ax would be uncommonly handy just now, I thought.

Fergus and Marsali were goneâ€”they, too, would have helped to stem the tide. But the most important absence was Rogerâ€™s. He alone had been keeping the Presbyterians more or less under control since the day of Malvaâ€™s accusation, or at least keeping a lid on the simmering pot of gossip and animosity. He might have cowed them nowâ€”had he been here.

The conversation had devolved from high drama to a three-way wrangle among Jamie, Brown, and Hiram, the former two adamant in their positions, and poor Hiram, quite unsuited to the task, trying to adjudicate. Insofar as I had feelings to spare, I felt rather sorry for him.

â€œTake him!â€ a voice called suddenly. Allan Christie pushed his way to the front of the crowd, and pointed at Jamie. His voice trembled and broke with emotion. â€œItâ€™s him debauched my sister, him that kilt her! If yeâ€™ll put someone to the trial, take him!â€

There was a subterranean rumble of agreement at that, and I saw John MacNeill and young Hugh Abernathy draw close together, glancing uneasily from Jamie to the three Lindsay brothers, and back again.

â€œNay, itâ€™s her!â€ a womanâ€™s voice called in contradiction, high and shrill. One of the fishersâ€™ wives; she stabbed a finger at me, face pinched with malevolence. â€œA man might kill a lass heâ€™d got wiâ€™ childâ€”but no man would do sich wickedness as to steal a babe unborn frae the womb! No but a witch would do thatâ€”and she found wiâ€™ the puir wee corpse in her hands!â€

A higher susurrus of condemnation greeted that. The men might possibly give me the benefit of doubtâ€”no woman would.

â€œBy the name of the Almighty!â€ Hiram was losing his grip on the situation, and becoming panicky. The situation was perilously close to degenerating into riot; anyone could feel the currents of hysteria and violence in the air. He cast his eyes up to heaven, looking for inspirationâ€”and found some.

â€œTake them both!â€ he said suddenly. He looked at Brown, then Jamie. â€œTake them both,â€ he repeated, testing the notion and finding it good. â€œYeâ€™ll go along, to see that nay harm comes to your wife,â€ he said reasonably to Jamie. â€œAnd if it should be proved that she is innocent . . .â€ His voice died away on that, as it dawned on him that what he was saying was that if I were proven innocent, Jamie must be guilty, and what a good idea it would be to have him on the spot to be hanged instead.

â€œShe is innocent; so am I.â€ Jamie spoke without heat, doggedly repeating it. He had no real hope of convincing anyone; the only doubt among the crowd was whether he or I was the guilty partyâ€”or whether we had plotted together to destroy Malva Christie.

He turned suddenly to face the crowd, and cried out to them in Gaelic.

â€œIf you will deliver us into the strangerâ€™s hand, then our blood be upon your heads, and you will answer for our lives upon the Day of Judgment!â€

A sudden hush fell on the crowd at that. Men glanced uncertainly at their neighbors, measured Brown and his cohort with doubtful eyes.

They were known to the community, but strangersâ€”Sassenachsâ€”in the Scottish sense. So was I, and a witch, to boot. Lecher, rapist, and Papist murderer he might beâ€”but Jamie at least was not a stranger.

The man I had shot was grinning at me evilly over Brownâ€™s shoulder; evidently, I had no more than grazed him, worse luck. I gave him stare for stare, sweat gathering between my breasts, moisture slick and hot beneath the veil of my hair.

A murmur was rising among the crowd; argument and disputation, and I could see the Ardsmuir men begin to make their way slowly toward the porch, pushing through the mob. Kenny Lindsayâ€™s eyes were fixed on Jamieâ€™s face, and I felt Jamie take a deep breath beside me.

They would fight for him, if he called them. But there were too few of them, and poorly armed, by contrast with Brownâ€™s mob. They would not winâ€”and there were women and children in the crowd. To call his men would provoke only bloody riot, and leave the deaths of innocents upon his conscience. That was not a burden he could bear; not now.

I saw him come to this conclusion, and his mouth tighten. I had no idea what he might be about to do, but he was forestalled. There was a disturbance at the edge of the crowd; people turned to look, then froze, stricken silent.

Thomas Christie came through the crowd; in spite of the darkness and wavering torchlight, I knew at once it was him. He walked like an old man, hunched and halting, looking at no one. The crowd gave way before him at once, deeply respectful of his grief.

The grief was plainly marked on his face. He had let his beard and hair go untrimmed, uncombed, and both were matted. His eyes were pouched and bloodshot, the lines from nose to mouth black furrows through his beard. His eyes were alive, though, alert and intelligent. He walked through the crowd, past his son, as though he were alone, and came up the steps onto the porch.

â€œI will go with them to Hillsboro,â€ he said quietly to Hiram Crombie. â€œLet them both be taken, if ye willâ€”but I will travel with them, as surety that no further evil may be done. Surely justice is mine, if it be anyoneâ€™s.â€

Brown looked much taken aback by this declaration; plainly it wasnâ€™t what heâ€™d had in mind at all. But the crowd was in instant sympathy, murmuring agreement at the proposed solution. Everyone had the greatest compassion and respect for Tom Christie in the wake of his daughterâ€™s murder, and the general feeling seemed to be that this gesture was one of the greatest magnanimity.

It was, too, as he had in all likelihood just saved our livesâ€”at least for the moment. From the look in his eye, Jamie would strongly have preferred simply to take his chances on killing Richard Brown, but realized that beggars could not be choosers, and acquiesced as gracefully as possible, with a nod of the head.

Christieâ€™s gaze rested on me for a moment, then turned to Jamie.

â€œIf it will suit your convenience, Mr. Fraser, perhaps we will leave in the morning? There is no reason why you and your wife should not rest in your own beds.â€

Jamie bowed to him.

â€œI thank ye, sir,â€ he said with great formality. Christie nodded back, then turned and went back down the steps, completely ignoring Richard Brown, who was looking at once irritated and confounded.

I saw Kenny Lindsay close his eyes, shoulders slumping in relief. Then Jamie put his hand under my elbow, and we turned, going into our house for what might be the final night spent under its roof.

IN THE WAKE OF SCANDAL




THE RAIN THAT HAD THREATENED arrived in the night, and the day dawned gray, bleak, and wet. Mrs. Bug was in a similar state, sniffling into her apron and repeating over and over, â€œOh, if only Arch had been here! But I couldna find anyone save Kenny Lindsay, and by the time heâ€™d run for MacNeill and Abernathyâ€”â€

â€œDinna fash yourself for it, a leannan,â€ Jamie said, and kissed her affectionately on the brow. â€œIt may be for the best. No one was damaged, the house is still standingâ€â€”he cast a wistful eye toward the rafters, every beam shaped by his own handâ€”â€œand it may be weâ€™ll have this wretched matter settled soon, God willing.â€

â€œGod willing,â€ she echoed fervently, crossing herself. She sniffed and wiped her eyes. â€œAnd Iâ€™ve packed a wee bit of food, that ye shouldna starve on the way, sir.â€

Richard Brown and his men had sheltered under the trees as best they could; no one had offered them hospitality, which was as damning an indication of their unpopularity as could be imagined, Highland standards being what they were in such matters. And as clear an indication of our own unpopularity, that Brown should be permitted to take us into custody.

In consequence, Brownâ€™s men were soaking wet, ill-fed, sleepless, and short-tempered. I hadnâ€™t slept, either, but I was at least full of breakfast, warm, andâ€”for the momentâ€”dry, which made me feel a little better, though my heart felt hollow and my bones filled with lead as we reached the head of the trail and I looked back across the clearing at the house, with Mrs. Bug standing waving on the porch. I waved back, and then my horse plunged into the darkness of the dripping trees.

It was a grim journey, and silent for the most part. Jamie and I rode close together, but couldnâ€™t speak of anything important, in hearing of Brownâ€™s men. As for Richard Brown, he was seriously out of countenance.

It was reasonably clear that he had never intended to take me anywhere for trial, but had merely seized upon the pretext as a means of revenging himself on Jamie for Lionelâ€™s deathâ€”and God knew what he would have done, I reflected, had he known what had really happened to his brother, and Mrs. Bug there within armâ€™s length of him. With Tom Christie along, though, there was nothing he could do; he was obliged to take us to Hillsboro, and he did so with bad grace.

Tom Christie rode like a man in a dreamâ€”a bad dreamâ€”his face closed and inward-looking, speaking to no one.

The man Jamie had slashed was not there; I supposed he had gone home to Brownsville. The gentleman I had shot was still with us, though.

I couldnâ€™t tell how bad the wound was, nor yet whether the bullet had gone into him or merely grazed his side. He wasnâ€™t incapacitated, but it was plain from the way he hunched to one side, his face contorting now and then, that he was in pain.

I hesitated for some time. I had brought a small medical kit with me, as well as saddlebags and bedroll. Under the circumstances, I felt relatively little sense of compassion for the man. On the other hand, instinct was strongâ€”and as I said to Jamie in an undertone when we stopped to make camp for the evening, it wouldnâ€™t help matters if he died of infection.

I steeled myself to offer to examine and dress the wound, as soon as the opportunity should occur. The manâ€”his name seemed to be Ezra, though under the circumstances, no formal introductions had been madeâ€”was in charge of distributing bowls of food at supper, and I waited under the pine where Jamie and I had taken shelter, intending to speak kindly to him when he brought our food.

He came over, a bowl in each hand, shoulders hunched under a leather coat against the rain. Before I could speak, though, he grinned nastily, spat thickly in one bowl, and handed it to me. The other he dropped at Jamieâ€™s feet, spattering his legs with dried-venison stew.

â€œOops,â€ he said mildly, and turned on his heel.

Jamie contracted sharply, like a big snake coiling, but I got hold of his arm before he could strike.

â€œNever mind,â€ I said, and raising my voice just a little, said, â€œLet him rot.â€

The manâ€™s head snapped round, wide-eyed.

â€œLet him rot,â€ I repeated, staring at him. Iâ€™d seen the flush of fever in his face when he came near, and smelled the faint sweet scent of pus.

Ezra looked completely taken back. He hurried back to the sputtering fire, and refused to look in my direction.

I was still holding the bowl heâ€™d given me, and was startled to have it taken from my hand. Tom Christie threw the contents of the bowl into a bush, and handed me his own, then turned away without speaking.

â€œButâ€”â€ I started after him, meaning to give it back. We wouldnâ€™t starve, thanks to Mrs. Bugâ€™s â€œwee bit of food,â€ which filled one entire saddlebag. Jamieâ€™s hand on my arm stopped me, though.

â€œEat it, Sassenach,â€ he said softly. â€œItâ€™s kindly meant.â€

More than kind, I thought. I was aware of hostile eyes upon me, from the group around the fire. My throat was tight, and I had no appetite, but I took my spoon from my pocket and ate.

Beneath a nearby hemlock tree, Tom Christie had wrapped himself in a blanket and lain down alone, his hat pulled down over his face.



IT RAINED ALL THE WAY to Salisbury. We found shelter in an inn there, and seldom had a fire seemed so welcome. Jamie had brought what cash we had, and in consequence, we could afford a room to ourselves. Brown posted a guard on the stair, but that was merely for show; after all, where would we go?

I stood in front of the fire in my shift, my wet cloak and gown spread over a bench to dry.

â€œYou know,â€ I observed, â€œRichard Brown hasnâ€™t thought this out at all.â€ Not surprising, that, since he hadnâ€™t actually intended to take me or us to trial. â€œWho, exactly, does he mean to hand us over to?â€

â€œThe sheriff of the county,â€ Jamie replied, untying his hair and shaking it out over the hearth, so that droplets of water sizzled and popped in the fire. â€œOr failing that, a justice of the peace, perhaps.â€

â€œYes, but what then? Heâ€™s got no evidenceâ€”no witnesses. How can there be any semblance of a trial?â€

Jamie looked at me curiously.

â€œYeâ€™ve never been tried for anything, have ye, Sassenach?â€

â€œYou know I havenâ€™t.â€

He nodded.

â€œI have. For treason.â€

â€œYes? And what happened?â€

He ran a hand through his damp hair, considering.

â€œThey made me stand up, and asked my name. I gave it, the judge muttered to his friend for a bit, and then he said, â€˜Condemned. Imprisonment for life. Put him in irons.â€™ And they took me out to the courtyard and had a blacksmith hammer fetters onto my wrists. The next day we began walking to Ardsmuir.â€

â€œThey made you walk there? From Inverness?â€

â€œI wasna in any great hurry, Sassenach.â€

I took a deep breath, trying to stem the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.

â€œI see. Well . . . but surelyâ€”wouldnâ€™t m-murderâ€â€”I could just about say it without stammering, but not quite, yetâ€”â€œbe a matter for a jury trial?â€

â€œIt might, and certainly I shall insist upon itâ€”if things go so far. Mr. Brown seems to think they may; heâ€™s telling everyone in the taproom the story, making us out to be monsters of depravity. Which I must say is no great feat,â€ he added ruefully, â€œconsidering the circumstances.â€

I pressed my lips tight together, to avoid giving a hasty answer. I knew he knew that I had had no choiceâ€”he knew that I knew he had had nothing to do with Malva in the first placeâ€”but I could not help but feel a sense of blame in both directions, for this desperate muddle in which we found ourselves. Both for what had happened afterward, and for Malvaâ€™s death itselfâ€”though God knew I would give anything to have her alive again.

He was right about Brown, I realized. Cold and wet, Iâ€™d paid little attention to the noises from the taproom below, but I could hear Brownâ€™s voice, echoing up the chimney, and from the random words that came through, it was apparent that he was doing exactly what Jamie saidâ€”blackening our characters, making it out that he and his Committee of Safety had undertaken the ignoble but necessary job of apprehending us and committing us to justice. And, just incidentally, carefully prejudicing any potential jury members by making sure the story spread abroad in all its scandalous detail.

â€œIs there anything to be done?â€ I asked, having listened to as much of this nonsense as I could stomach.

He nodded, and pulled a clean shirt from his saddlebag.

â€œGo down for supper, and look as little like depraved murderers as possible, a nighean.â€

â€œRight,â€ I said, and with a sigh, withdrew the ribbon-trimmed cap I had packed.



I SHOULDNâ€™T HAVE been surprised. I had lived long enough to have a fairly cynical view of human natureâ€”and lived long enough in this time to know how directly public opinion expressed itself. And yet I was still shocked, when the first stone hit me in the thigh.

We were some distance south of Hillsboro. The weather continued wet, the roads muddy, and the travel difficult. I think Richard Brown would have been pleased to relinquish us to the sheriff of Rowan countyâ€”if such a person had been available. The office, he was informed, was currently unfilled, the last occupant having decamped hurriedly overnight and no one yet found willing to replace him.

A matter of politics, I gathered, the recent sheriff having leaned toward independency, whilst the majority of persons in the county were still strongly Loyalist. I didnâ€™t learn the specifics of the incident that had triggered the recent sheriffâ€™s hasty departure, but the taverns and inns near Hillsboro were buzzing like hornetsâ€™ nests in the wake of it.

The Circuit Court had ceased to meet some months before, Brown was informed, the justices who attended it feeling it too dangerous to appear in the present unsettled state of things. The sole justice of the peace he was able to discover felt similarly, and declined point-blank to take custody of us, informing Brown that it was more than his life was worth, to be involved in anything even faintly controversial at the moment.

â€œBut itâ€™s nothing to do with politics!â€ Brown had shouted at him, frustrated. â€œItâ€™s murder, for Godâ€™s sakeâ€”black murder!â€

â€œAnything and everythingâ€™s political these days, sir,â€ the JP, one Harvey Mickelgrass, informed him sadly, shaking his head. â€œI should not venture to address even a case of drunk and disorderly, for fear of having my house pulled down around my ears and my wife left widowed. The sheriff attempted to sell his office, but could find no one willing to purchase it. No, sirâ€”you will have to go elsewhere.â€

Brown would by no means take us to Cross Creek or Campbelton, where Jocasta Cameronâ€™s influence was strong, and where the local justice was her good friend, Farquard Campbell. And so we headed south, toward Wilmington.

Brownâ€™s men were disedified; they had expected a simple lynching and house-burning, perhaps the odd bit of lootingâ€”not this long-drawn-out and tedious plodding from place to place. Their spirits were further lowered when Ezra, who had been clinging to his horse in a dogged daze of fever, fell suddenly into the road and was picked up dead.

I didnâ€™t ask to examine the bodyâ€”and wouldnâ€™t have been given leave in any caseâ€”but I rather thought from the lolling looks of him that he had simply lost consciousness, tumbled off, and broken his neck.

Not a few of the others cast looks of open fear toward me in the wake of this occurrence, though, and their sense of enthusiasm for the venture diminished visibly.

Richard Brown was not deterred; he would, I was sure, have shot us without mercy long since, had it not been for Tom Christie, silent and gray as the morning fog on the roads. He said little, and that little confined to necessities. I should have thought him moving mechanically, in the numb haze of griefâ€”had I not turned one evening as we camped by the road, to see his eyes fixed upon me, with a look of such naked anguish in them that I glanced hastily away, only to see Jamie, sitting beside me, watching Tom Christie with a very thoughtful expression.

For the most part, though, he kept his face impassiveâ€”what could be seen of it, under the shade of his leather slouch hat. And Richard Brown, prevented by Christieâ€™s presence from doing us active harm, took every opportunity to spread his version of the tale of Malvaâ€™s murderâ€”perhaps as much to harrow Tom Christie in the hearing of it, over and over again, as for its effect on our reputations.

At any rate, I should not have been surprised when they stoned us, in a small, nameless hamlet south of Hillsboroâ€”but I was. A young boy had seen us on the road, stared as we rode byâ€”then vanished like a fox, scampering down a bank with the news. And ten minutes later, we rode around a bend in the road and into a fusillade of stones and shrieks.

One struck my mare on the shoulder and she shied violently. I kept my seat narrowly, but was off-balance; another hit me in the thigh, and another high in the chest, knocking the breath from me, and when one more bounced painfully off my head, I lost my grip on the reins, and as the horse, panicked, curvetted and spun, I flew off, landing on the ground with a bone-shaking thud.

I should have been terrified; in fact, I was furious. The stone that had hit me in the head had glanced offâ€”thanks to the thickness of my hair and the cap I woreâ€”but with the infuriating sting of a slap or a pinch, rather than true impact. I was on my feet by reflex, staggering, but caught sight of a jeering boy on the bank above me, hooting and dancing in triumph. I lunged, caught him by the foot and jerked.

He yelped, slipped, and fell on top of me. We crashed to the ground together, and rolled in a tangle of skirts and cloak. I was older, heavier, and completely berserk. All the fear, misery, and uncertainty of the last weeks came to an instant boil, and I punched his sneering face, twice, as hard as I could. I felt something crack in my hand, and pain shot up my arm.

He bellowed, and wriggled to escapeâ€”he was smaller than I was, but strong with panic. I struggled to keep a grip on him, got him by the hairâ€”he struck out at me, flailing, and knocked off my cap, getting one hand in my hair and yanking hard.

The pain reignited my fury and I jammed a knee into him, anywhere I could, again, and once more, blindly seeking his soft parts. His mouth opened in a soundless â€œOâ€ and his eyes bulged; his fingers relaxed and let go of my hair, and I reared up over him and slapped him as hard as I possibly could.

A big rock struck my shoulder with a numbing blow and I was knocked sideways by the impact. I tried to hit him again, but couldnâ€™t lift my arm. Panting and sobbing, he writhed free of my cloak and scrambled away on hands and knees, nose bleeding. I whirled on my knees to look after him, and looked straight into the eyes of a young man, his face intent and blazing with excitement, rock at the ready.

It hit me in the cheekbone and I swayed, my vision gone blurry. Then something very large hit me from behind, and I found myself flat on my face, pressed into the ground, the weight of a body on top of mine. It was Jamie; I could tell by the breathless â€œHoly Mother.â€ His body jerked as the stones hit him; I could hear the horrifying thud of them into his flesh.

There was a lot of shouting going on. I heard Tom Christieâ€™s hoarse voice, then the firing of a single shot. More yelling, but of a different character. One or two soft thumps, stones striking earth nearby, a last grunt from Jamie as one slammed into him.

We lay pressed flat for a few moments, and I became aware of the uncomfortably spiky plant squashed under my cheek, the scent of its leaves harsh and bitter in my nose.

Then Jamie sat up, slowly, drawing in his breath with a catch, and I rose in turn on a shaky arm, nearly falling. My cheek was puffed and my hand and shoulder throbbed, but I had no attention to spare for that.

â€œAre you all right?â€ Jamie had got halfway to his feet, then sat down again, suddenly. He was pale, and a trickle of blood ran down the side of his face from a cut in his scalp, but he nodded, a hand pressed to his side.

â€œAye, fine,â€ he said, but with a breathlessness that told me he likely had cracked ribs. â€œYeâ€™re all right, Sassenach?â€

â€œFine.â€ I managed to get to my feet, trembling. Brownâ€™s men were scattered, some chasing the horses who had fled in the melee, others cursing, gathering up scattered bits of belongings from the road. Tom Christie was vomiting into the bushes by the road. Richard Brown stood under a tree, watching, his face white. He glanced at me sharply, then away.

We stopped at no more taverns on the way.

A MOONLICHT FLICHT




WHEN YE GO TO HIT SOMEONE, Sassenach, ye want to do it in the soft parts. Faces have too many bones. And then thereâ€™s the teeth to be thinkinâ€™ of.â€

Jamie spread her fingers, gently pressing the scraped, swollen knuckles, and air hissed between her own teeth.

â€œThanks so much for the advice. And youâ€™ve broken your hand how many times, hitting people?â€

He wanted to laugh; the vision of her pounding that wee boy in a fury of berserk rage, hair flying in the wind and a look of blood in her eye, was one he would treasure. He didnâ€™t, though.

â€œYour handâ€™s not broken, a nighean.â€ He curled her fingers, cupping her loose fist with both of his.

â€œHow would you know?â€ she snapped. â€œIâ€™m the doctor here.â€

He stopped trying to hide his smile.

â€œIf it were broken,â€ he said, â€œyeâ€™d be white and puking, not red-faced and crankit.â€

â€œCrankit, my arse!â€ She pulled her hand free, glaring at him as she nursed it against her bosom. She was in fact only slightly flushed, and most attractive, with her hair curling out in a wild mass round her head. One of Brownâ€™s men had picked up her fallen cap after the attack, timidly offering it to her. Enraged, she had snatched it from him and stuffed it violently into a saddlebag.

â€œAre ye hungry, lass?â€

â€œYes,â€ she admitted grudgingly, as aware as he was that folk with broken bones generally had little appetite immediately, though they ate amazingly, once the pain had backed a bit.

He rummaged in the saddlebag, blessing Mrs. Bug as he came out with a handful of dried apricots and a large wrapped wedge of goatâ€™s cheese. Brownâ€™s men were cooking something over their fire, but he and Claire had not touched any food but their own, not since the first night.

How much longer might this farce go on? he wondered, breaking off a bit of cheese and handing it to his wife. They had food for perhaps a week, with care. Long enough, maybe, to reach the coast, and the weather held good. And what then?

It had been plain to him from the first that Brown had no plan, and was attempting to deal with a situation that had been out of his control since the first moment. Brown had ambition, greed, and a respectable sense of revenge, but almost no capacity of forethought, that much was clear.

Now, here he was, saddled with the two of them, forced to travel on and on, the unwelcome responsibility dragging like a worn-out shoe tied to a dogâ€™s tail. And Brown the hindered dog, snarling and turning in circles, snapping at the thing that hampered him, and biting his own tail in consequence. Half his men had been wounded by the flung stones. Jamie thoughtfully touched a large, painful bruise on the point of his elbow.

He himself had had no choice; now Brown hadnâ€™t, either. His men were growing restive; they had crops to tend, and hadnâ€™t bargained for what they must see now as a foolâ€™s errand.

It would be a simple matter to escape by himself. But then what? He could not leave Claire in Brownâ€™s hands, and even were he able to get her safe away, they could not return to the Ridge with matters as they were; to do so would be to find themselves straight back in the pot.

He sighed, then caught his breath and let it out gingerly. He didnâ€™t think his ribs were cracked, but they hurt.

â€œYeâ€™ve a bit of ointment, I expect?â€ he said, nodding at the bag that held her bits of medicine.

â€œYes, of course.â€ She swallowed her bite of cheese, reaching for the bag. â€œIâ€™ll put some on that cut on your head.â€

He let her do that, but then insisted upon anointing her hand in turn. She objected, insisting that she was perfectly fine, needed no such thing, they should save the ointment in case of future needâ€”and yet she let him take her hand and smooth the sweet-smelling cream into her knuckles, the small fine bones of her hand hard under his fingers.

She so hated being helpless in any wayâ€”but the armor of righteous fury was wearing off, and while she kept a fierce face for Brown and the rest, he knew she was afraid. Not without reason, either.

Brown was uneasy, unable to settle. He moved to and fro, talking aimlessly with one man or another, needlessly checking the hobbled horses, pouring a cup of chicory coffee and holding it undrunk until it grew cold, then flinging it into the weeds. And all the time, his restless gaze returned to them.

Brown was hasty, impetuous, and half-baked. He was not entirely stupid, Jamie thought. And clearly he had realized that his strategy of spreading gossip and scandal concerning his prisoners in order to endanger them had severe defects, so long as he was himself obliged to continue in close proximity to said prisoners.

Their simple meal finished, Jamie lay down, carefully, and Claire curled herself into him spoonwise, wanting comfort.

Fighting was an exhausting business, and so was fear; she was asleep in moments. Jamie felt the pull of sleep, but would not yield to it yet. He occupied himself instead in reciting some of the poems Brianna had told himâ€”he quite liked the one about the silversmith in Boston, riding to spread the alarm to Lexington, which he considered a handsome piece.

The company was beginning to settle for the night. Brown was still a-fidget, sitting staring darkly at the ground, then leaping to his feet to stride up and down. By contrast, Christie had barely stirred, though he made no move to go to bed. He sat on a rock, his supper barely touched.

A flicker of movement near Christieâ€™s boot; a wee small mouse, making feints toward the neglected plate that sat on the ground, filled with bounty.

It had occurred to Jamie a couple of days before, in the vague way that one recognizes a fact unconsciously known for some time, that Tom Christie was in love with his wife.

Poor bugger, he thought. Surely Christie did not believe that Claire had had aught to do with the death of his daughter; if so, he would not be here. Did he think that Jamie, though . . . ?

He lay in the shelter of the darkness, watching the fire play across Christieâ€™s haggard features, his eyes half-hooded, giving no hint of his thoughts. There were men who could be read like books; Tom Christie wasnâ€™t one of them. But if ever he had seen a man being eaten alive before his eyes . . .

Was it the fate of his daughter, aloneâ€”or also the desperate need of a woman? Heâ€™d seen that need before, that gnawing at the soul, and knew it personally. Or did Christie think that Claire had killed wee Malva, or been in some way involved? There would be a quandary for an honorable man.

The need of a woman . . . the thought brought him back to the moment, and the awareness that the sounds he had been listening for in the wood behind him were now there. He had known for the past two days that they were followed, but last night they had camped in an open meadow, with no cover at all.

Moving slowly, but with no attempt at furtiveness, he rose, covered Claire with his cloak, and stepped into the wood, like one called by nature.

The moon was pale and hunchbacked and there was little light beneath the trees. He closed his eyes to damp the fire shadow and opened them again to the dark world, that place of shapes that lacked dimension and air that held spirits.

It was no spirit that stepped out from behind the blur of a pine tree, though.

â€œBlessed Michael defend us,â€ he said softly.

â€œThe blessed host of angels and archangels be with ye, Uncle,â€ said Ian, in the same soft tone. â€œThough I am thinking that a few thrones and dominations wouldna come amiss, either.â€

â€œWell, I wouldna argue, if Divine Intervention chose to take a hand,â€ Jamie said, heartened most amazingly by his nephewâ€™s presence. â€œIâ€™m sure Iâ€™ve no notion how else we shall escape this foolish coil.â€

Ian grunted at that; Jamie saw his nephewâ€™s head turn, checking the faint glow of the camp. Without discussion, they moved further into the wood.

â€œI canna be gone for long, without they come after me,â€ he said. â€œFirst, thenâ€”is all well wiâ€™ the Ridge?â€

Ian lifted a shoulder.

â€œThereâ€™s talk,â€ he said, the tone of his voice indicating that â€œtalkâ€ covered everything from auld wivesâ€™ gossip to the sort of insult that must be settled by violence. â€œNo one killed yet, though. What shall I do, Uncle Jamie?â€

â€œRichard Brown. Heâ€™s thinking, and God only kens what that will lead to.â€

â€œHe thinks too much; such men are dangerous,â€ Ian said, and laughed. Jamie, who had never known his nephew to read a book willingly, gave him a look of disbelief, but dismissed questions in favor of the pressing concerns of the moment.

â€œAye, he is,â€ he said dryly. â€œHeâ€™s been spreading the story in pothouses and inns as we goâ€”at a guess, in hopes of rousing public indignation to the point that some poor fool of a constable can be pushed into taking us off his hands, or better yet, that a mob might be stirred up to seize us and hang us out of hand, thus resolving his difficulty.â€

â€œOh, aye? Well, if thatâ€™s what he had in mind, Uncle, itâ€™s working. Ye wouldna countenance some of the things Iâ€™ve heard, following in your tracks.â€

â€œI know.â€ Jamie stretched gently, easing his painful ribs. It was only the mercy of God that it hadnâ€™t been worseâ€”that, and Claireâ€™s rage, which had interrupted the attack, as everyone stopped to watch the engrossing spectacle of her hatcheling her assailant like a bundle of flax.

â€œItâ€™s come home to him, though, that if ye mean to pin a target on someone, itâ€™s wise to step away smartly thereafter. Heâ€™s thinking, as I say. Should he go off, then, or send someone . . .â€

â€œIâ€™ll follow, aye, and see whatâ€™s to do.â€

He sensed rather than saw Ianâ€™s nod; they stood in black shadow, the faint haze of moonlight like fog in the space between the trees. The lad moved, as though to go, then hesitated.

â€œYeâ€™re sure, Uncle, as it wouldna be better to wait a bit, then creep away? Thereâ€™s nay bracken, but thereâ€™s decent cover in the hills nearby; we could be safe hidden by dawn.â€

It was a great temptation. He felt the pull of the dark wild forest, above all, the lure of freedom. If he could but walk away into the greenwood, and stay there . . . But he shook his head.

â€œIt wouldna do, Ian,â€ he said, though he let regret show in his voice. â€œWe should be fugitives, thenâ€”and doubtless wiâ€™ a price on our heads. With the countryside already roused against usâ€”broadsides, posted bills? The public would do Brownâ€™s work for him, promptly. And then, to run would seem an admission of guilt, forbye.â€

Ian sighed, but nodded agreement.

â€œWell, then,â€ he said. He stepped forward and embraced Jamie, squeezing hard for an instant, and then was gone.

Jamie let out a long, tentative breath against the pain of his injured ribs.

â€œGod go with ye, Ian,â€ he said to the dark, and turned back.

When he lay down again beside his wife, the camp was silent. The men lay like logs, wrapped in their blankets. Two figures, though, remained by the embers of the dying fire: Richard Brown and Thomas Christie, each alone on a rock with his thoughts.

Ought he to wake Claire, tell her? He considered for a moment, his cheek against the warm softness of her hair, and reluctantly decided no. It might hearten her a little to know of Ianâ€™s presenceâ€”but he dare not risk rousing Brownâ€™s suspicion; and if Brown were to perceive by any change in Claireâ€™s mood or face that something had happened . . . no, best not. At least not yet.

He glanced along the ground at Christieâ€™s feet, and saw the faint pale scurry of movement in the dark; the mouse had brought friends to share her feast.

FORTY-SIX BEANS

TO THE GOOD




AT DAWN, RICHARD BROWN WAS GONE. The rest of the men seemed grim, but resigned, and under the command of a squatty, morose sort of fellow named Oakes, we resumed our push south.

Something had changed in the night; Jamie had lost a little of the tension that had infused him since our departure from the Ridge. Stiff, sore, and disheartened as I was, I found this change some comfort, though wondering what had caused it. Was it the same thing that had caused Richard Brown to leave on his mysterious errand?

Jamie said nothing, though, beyond inquiring after my handâ€”which was tender, and so stiff that I couldnâ€™t immediately flex my fingers. He continued to keep a watchful eye on our companions, but the lessening of tension had affected them, too; I began to lose my fear that they might suddenly lose patience and string us up, Tom Christieâ€™s dour presence notwithstanding.

As though in accord with this more relaxed atmosphere, the weather suddenly cleared, which heartened everyone further. It would have been stretching things to say that there was any sense of rapprochement, but without Richard Brownâ€™s constant malevolence, the other men at least became occasionally civil. And as it always did, the tedium and hardships of travel wore everyone down, so that we rolled down the rutted roads like a pack of marbles, occasionally caroming off one another, dusty, silent, and united in exhaustion, if nothing else, by the end of each day.

This neutral state of affairs changed abruptly in Brunswick. For a day or two before, Oakes had been plainly anticipating something, and when we reached the first houses, I could see him beginning to draw great breaths of relief.

It was therefore no surprise when we stopped to refresh ourselves at a pothouse on the edge of the tiny, half-abandoned settlement, to find Richard Brown awaiting us. It was a surprise when, without more than a murmured word from Brown, Oakes and two others suddenly seized Jamie, knocking the cup of water from his hand and slamming him against the wall of the building.

I dropped my own cup and flung myself toward them, but Richard Brown grabbed my arm in a viselike grip and dragged me toward the horses.

â€œLet go! What are you doing? Let go, I say!â€ I kicked him, and had a good go at scratching out his eyes, but he got hold of both my wrists, and shouted for one of the other men to help. Between the two of them, they got meâ€”still screaming at the top of my lungsâ€”on a horse in front of another of Brownâ€™s men. There was a deal of shouting from Jamieâ€™s direction, and general hubbub, as a few people came out of the pothouse, staring. None of them seemed disposed to interfere with a large group of armed men, though.

Tom Christie was shouting protests; I glimpsed him hammering on the back of one man, but to no avail. The man behind me wrapped an arm round my middle and jerked it tight, knocking out what breath I had left.

Then we were thundering down the road, Brunswickâ€”and Jamieâ€”disappearing in the dust.

My furious protests, demands, and questions brought no response, of course, beyond an order to be quiet, this accompanied by another warning squeeze of the restraining arm around me.

Shaking with rage and terror, I subsided, and at that point, saw that Tom Christie was still with us, looking shaken and disturbed.

â€œTom!â€ I shouted. â€œTom, go back! Donâ€™t let them kill him! Please!â€

He looked in my direction, startled, rose in his stirrups, and looked back toward Brunswick, then turned toward Richard Brown, shouting something.

Brown shook his head, reined his mount in so that Christie could come up alongside, and leaning over, yelled something at him that must have passed for explanation. Christie clearly didnâ€™t like the situation, but after a few impassioned exchanges, he subsided, scowling, and dropped back. He pulled his horseâ€™s head aside and circled back to come within speaking distance of me.

â€œThey will not kill nor harm him,â€ he said, raising his voice to be heard over the rumble of hooves and rattle of harness. â€œBrownâ€™s word of honor upon it, he says.â€

â€œAnd you believe him, for Godâ€™s sake?â€

He looked disconcerted at that, glanced again at Brown, who had spurred up to ride ahead, then back at Brunswick. Indecision played across his features, but then his lips firmed and he shook his head.

â€œIt will be all right,â€ he said. But he would not meet my eyes, and in spite of my continued entreaties to him to go back, to stop them, he slackened his pace, falling back so that I couldnâ€™t see him anymore.

My throat was raw from screaming, and my stomach hurt, bruised and clenched in a knot of fear. Our speed had slowed, now that we had left Brunswick behind, and I concentrated on breathing; I wouldnâ€™t speak until I was sure I could do so without my voice trembling.

â€œWhere are you taking me?â€ I asked finally. I sat stiff in the saddle, enduring an unwanted intimacy with the man behind me.

â€œNew Bern,â€ he said, with a note of grim satisfaction. â€œAnd then, thank God, weâ€™ll be shut of you at last.â€



THE JOURNEY TO NEW BERN passed in a blur of fear, agitation, and physical discomfort. While I did wonder what was about to happen to me, all such speculations were drowned by my anxiety about Jamie.

Tom Christie was plainly my only hope of finding out anything, but he avoided me, keeping his distanceâ€”and I found that as alarming as anything else. He was clearly troubled, even more so than he had been since Malvaâ€™s death, but he no longer bore a look of dull suffering; he was actively agitated. I was terribly afraid that he knew or suspected Jamie was dead, but would not admit itâ€”either to me, or to himself.

All of the men clearly shared my captorâ€™s urge to be rid of me as soon as possible; we stopped only briefly, when absolutely necessary for the horses to rest. I was offered food, but could not eat. By the time we reached New Bern, I was completely drained from the sheer physical exertion of the ride, but much more so from the constant strain of apprehension.

Most of the men remained at a tavern on the outskirts of the town; Brown and one of the other men took me through the streets, accompanied by a silent Tom Christie, arriving at last at a large house of whitewashed brick. The home, as Brown informed me with a sense of lively pleasure, of Sheriff Tolliverâ€”also, the town gaol.

The sheriff, a darkly handsome sort, viewed me with a sort of interested speculation, mingled with a growing disgust as he heard the crime of which I was accused. I made no attempt at rebuttal or defense; the room was going in and out of focus, and all my attention was required to keep my knees from giving way.

I barely heard most of the exchange between Brown and the sheriff. At the last, though, just before I was led away into the house, I found Tom Christie suddenly beside me.

â€œMrs. Fraser,â€ he said, very low. â€œBelieve me, he is safe. I would not have his death on my conscienceâ€”nor yours.â€ He was looking at me directly, for the first time in . . . days? weeks? . . . and I found the intensity of his gray eyes both disconcerting and oddly comforting.

â€œTrust in God,â€ he whispered. â€œHe will deliver the righteous out of all his dangers.â€ And with a sudden hard and unexpected squeeze of my hand, he was gone.



AS EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY gaols went, it could have been worse. The womenâ€™s quarters consisted of a small room at the back of the sheriffâ€™s house, which had likely been a storeroom of sorts originally. The walls were roughly plastered, though some escape-minded former occupant had chipped away a large chunk of the plaster, before discovering that beneath it lay a layer of lath, and beneath that an impenetrable wall of baked-clay brick, which confronted me at once with its bland impenetrability when the door was opened.

There was no window, but an oil dip burned on a ledge by the door, casting a faint circle of light that illuminated the daunting bare patch of brick, but left the corners of the room in deep shadow. I couldnâ€™t see the night-soil bucket, but knew there was one; the thick, acrid tang of it stung my nose, and I automatically began breathing through my mouth as the sheriff pushed me into the room.

The door closed firmly behind me, and a key grated in the lock.

There was a single, narrow bedstead in the shadows, occupied by a large lump under a threadbare blanket. The lump took its time, but eventually stirred and sat up, resolving itself into a small, plump woman, capless and frowsy with sleep, who sat blinking at me like a dormouse.

â€œErmp,â€ she said, and rubbed her eyes with her fists, like a small child.

â€œSo sorry to disturb you,â€ I said politely. My heart had slowed a bit by now, though I was still shaking and short of breath. I pressed my hands flat against the door to stop them trembling.

â€œThink nothing of it,â€ she said, and yawned suddenly, like a hippopotamus, showing me a set of worn but serviceable molars. Blinking and smacking her lips absently, she reached down beside her, pulled out a battered pair of spectacles, and set them firmly on her nose.

Her eyes were blue, and hugely magnified by the lenses, enormous with curiosity.

â€œWhatâ€™s your name?â€ she asked.

â€œClaire Fraser,â€ I said, watching her narrowly, in case she too might already have heard all about my supposed crime. The bruise on my breast left by the stone that had struck me was still visible, beginning to yellow above the edge of my gown.

â€œOh?â€ She squinted, as though trying to place me, but evidently failed, for she shrugged away the effort. â€œGot any money?â€

â€œA bit.â€ Jamie had forced me to take almost all the moneyâ€”not a great deal, but there was a small weight of coin at the bottom of each of the pockets tied around my waist, and a couple of proclamation notes tucked inside my stays.

The woman was a good deal shorter than I, and pillowy in aspect, with large, drooping breasts and several comfortable rolls corrugating her uncorseted middle; she was in her shift, with her gown and stays hung from a nail in the wall. She seemed harmlessâ€”and I began to breathe a little more easily, beginning to grasp the fact that at least I was safe for the moment, no longer in danger of sudden, random violence.

The other prisoner made no offensive moves toward me, but hopped down off the bed, bare feet thumping softly in what I realized now was a matted layer of moldy straw.

â€œWell, call the old bizzom and send for some Holland, then, why donâ€™t you?â€ she suggested cheerfully.

â€œThe . . who?â€

Instead of answering, she trundled to the door and banged on it, shouting, â€œMrs. Tolliver! Mrs. Tolliver!â€

The door opened almost immediately, revealing a tall, thin woman, looking like an annoyed stork.

â€œReally, Mrs. Ferguson,â€ she said. â€œYou are the most dreadful nuisance. I was just coming to pay my respects to Mrs. Fraser, in any case.â€ She turned her back on Mrs. Ferguson with magisterial dignity and inclined her head a bare inch toward me.

â€œMrs. Fraser. I am Mrs. Tolliver.â€

I had a split second in which to decide how to react, and chose the prudentâ€”if gallingâ€”course of genteel submission, bowing to her as though she were the Governorâ€™s lady.

â€œMrs. Tolliver,â€ I murmured, careful not to meet her eyes. â€œHow kind of you.â€

She twitched, sharp-eyed, like a bird spotting the stealthy progress of a worm through the grassâ€”but I had firm control of my features by now, and she relaxed, detecting no sarcasm.

â€œYou are welcome,â€ she said with chilly courtesy. â€œI am to see to your welfare, and acquaint you with our custom. You will receive one meal each day, unless you wish to send to the ordinary for moreâ€”at your own expense. I will bring you a basin for washing once each day. Youâ€™ll carry your own slops. Andâ€”â€

â€œOh, stuff your custom, Maisie,â€ said Mrs. Ferguson, butting into Mrs. Tolliverâ€™s set speech with the comfortable assumption of long acquaintance. â€œSheâ€™s got some money. Fetch us a bottle of geneva, thereâ€™s a good girl, and then if you must, you can tell her whatâ€™s what.â€

Mrs. Tolliverâ€™s narrow face tightened in disapproval, but her eyes twitched toward me, bright in the dim light of the rush dip. I ventured a hesitant gesture toward my pocket, and her lower lip sucked in. She glanced over her shoulder, then took a quick step toward me.

â€œA shilling, then,â€ she whispered, hand held open between us. I dropped the coin into her palm, and it disappeared at once beneath her apron.

â€œYouâ€™ve missed supper,â€ she announced in her normal disapproving tones, stepping backward. â€œHowever, as youâ€™ve just come, I shall make an allowance and bring you something.â€

â€œHow kind of you,â€ I said again.

The door closed firmly behind her, shutting out light and air, and the key turned in the lock.

The sound of it set off a tiny spark of panic, and I stamped on it hard. I felt like a dried skin, stuffed to the eyeballs with the tinder of fear, uncertainty, and loss. It would take no more than a spark to ignite that and burn me to ashesâ€”and neither I nor Jamie could afford that.

â€œShe drinks?â€ I asked, turning back to my new roommate with an assumption of coolness.

â€œDo you know anyone who doesnâ€™t, given the chance?â€ Mrs. Ferguson asked reasonably. She scratched her ribs. â€œFraser, she said. You arenâ€™t theâ€”â€

â€œI am,â€ I said, rather rudely. â€œI donâ€™t want to talk about it.â€

Her eyebrows shot up, but she nodded equably.

â€œJust as you like,â€ she said. â€œAny good at cards?â€

â€œLoo or whist?â€ I asked warily.

â€œKnow a game called brag?â€

â€œNo.â€ Jamie and Brianna played it now and then, but I had never acquainted myself with the rules.

â€œThatâ€™s all right; Iâ€™ll teach you.â€ Reaching under the mattress, she pulled out a rather limp deck of pasteboards and fanned them expertly, waving them gently under her nose as she smiled at me.

â€œDonâ€™t tell me,â€ I said. â€œYouâ€™re in here for cheating at cards?â€

â€œCheat? Me? Not a bit of it,â€ she said, evidently unoffended. â€œForgery.â€

Rather to my own surprise, I laughed. I was still feeling shaky, but Mrs. Ferguson was definitely proving a welcome distraction.

â€œHow long have you been in here?â€ I asked.

She scratched at her head, realized that she wasnâ€™t wearing a cap, and turned to pull one out of the rumpled bedding.

â€œOhâ€”a month, just about.â€ Putting on the crumpled cap, she nodded at the doorpost beside me. Turning to look, I saw that it was crosshatched with dozens of small nicks, some old and dark with dirt, some freshly scratched, showing raw yellow wood. The sight of the marks made my stomach plunge again, but I took a deep breath and turned my back on them.

â€œHave you had a trial yet?â€

She shook her head, light glinting off her spectacles.

â€œNo, praise God. I hear from Maisie that the courtâ€™s shut down; all the justices gone into hiding. Hasnâ€™t been anybody tried in the last two months.â€

This was not good news. Evidently the thought showed on my face, for she leaned forward and patted my arm sympathetically.

â€œI wouldnâ€™t be in a hurry, dearie. Not in your shoes, I wouldnâ€™t. If theyâ€™ve not tried you, they canâ€™t hang you. And while I have met those as say the waitingâ€™s like to kill them, Iâ€™ve not seen anybody die of it. And I have seen them die at the end of a rope. Nasty business, that is.â€

She spoke almost negligently, but her own hand rose, as though by itself, and touched the soft white flesh of her neck. She swallowed, the tiny bump of her Adamâ€™s apple bobbing.

I swallowed, too, an unpleasantly constricted feeling in my own throat.

â€œBut Iâ€™m innocent,â€ I said, wondering even as I said it how I could sound so uncertain.

â€œâ€˜Course you are,â€ she said stoutly, giving my arm a squeeze. â€œYou stick to it, dearieâ€”donâ€™t you let â€™em bully-whack you into admitting the least little thing!â€

â€œI wonâ€™t,â€ I assured her dryly.

â€œOne of these days, a mobâ€™s like to come here,â€ she said, nodding. â€œString up the sheriff, if he donâ€™t look sharp. Heâ€™s not popular, Tolliver.â€

â€œI canâ€™t imagine why notâ€”a charming fellow like that.â€ I wasnâ€™t sure how I felt about the prospect of a mob storming the house. Stringing up Sheriff Tolliver was all very well, so far as that wentâ€”but with the memory of the hostile crowds in Salisbury and Hillsboro fresh in mind, I wasnâ€™t sure at all that theyâ€™d stop with the sheriff. Dying at the hands of a lynch mob wasnâ€™t at all preferable to the slower sort of judicial murder I likely faced. Though I supposed there was always a possibility of escaping in the riot.

And go where, if you did? I wondered.

With no good answer to that question, I shoved it to the back of my mind and turned my attention back to Mrs. Ferguson, who was still holding out the cards invitingly.

â€œAll right,â€ I said. â€œBut not for money.â€

â€œOh, no,â€ Mrs. Ferguson assured me. â€œPerish the thought. But we must have some sort of stake to make it interesting. Weâ€™ll play for beans, shall we?â€ She set down the cards, and digging under the pillow, withdrew a small pouch, from which she poured a handful of small white beans.

â€œSplendid,â€ I said. â€œAnd when weâ€™re finished, weâ€™ll plant them, shall we, and hope for a giant beanstalk to spring up and burst through the roof, so we can escape up it.â€

She burst into giggles at that, which somehow made me feel very slightly better.

â€œFrom your mouth to Godâ€™s ear, dearie!â€ she said. â€œIâ€™ll deal first, shall I?â€



BRAG APPEARED TO BE a form of poker. And while I had lived with a cardsharp long enough to know one when I saw one, Mrs. Ferguson appeared to be playing honestlyâ€”for the moment. I was forty-six beans to the good, by the time Mrs. Tolliver returned.

The door opened without ceremony, and she came in, holding a three-legged stool and a chunk of bread. This latter appeared to be both my supper and her ostensible excuse for visiting the cell, for she shoved it at me with a loud, â€œThis will have to keep you â€™til tomorrow, Mrs. Fraser!â€

â€œThank you,â€ I said mildly. It was fresh, and appeared to have been hastily dragged through bacon drippings, in lieu of butter. I bit into it without hesitation, having sufficiently recovered from shock now as to feel very hungry indeed.

Mrs. Tolliver, glancing over her shoulder to be sure the coast was clear, shut the door quietly, put down the stool, and drew a squat bottle from her pocket, blue glass and filled with some clear liquid.

She pulled the cork from it, tilted it, and drank deeply, her long, lean throat moving convulsively.

Mrs. Ferguson said nothing, but watched the process with a sort of analytic attention, light glinting from her spectacles, as though comparing Mrs. Tolliverâ€™s behavior with that of previous occasions.

Mrs. Tolliver lowered the bottle and stood for a moment grasping it, then handed it abruptly to me and sat down suddenly on the stool, breathing heavily.

I wiped the neck of the bottle as inconspicuously as possible on my sleeve, then took a token sip. It was gin, all rightâ€”heavily flavored with juniper berries to hide the poor quality, but powerfully alcoholic.

Mrs. Ferguson took a healthy guzzle in her turn, and so we continued, passing the bottle from hand to hand, exchanging small cordialities with it. Her first thirst slaked, Mrs. Tolliver became almost affable, her frosty manner thawing substantially. Even so, I waited until the bottle was nearly empty before asking the question foremost in my mind.

â€œMrs. Tolliver, the men who brought meâ€”did you happen to hear them say anything about my husband?â€

She put a fist to her mouth to stifle a belch.

â€œSay anything?â€

â€œAbout where he is,â€ I amended.

She blinked a little, looking blank.

â€œI didnâ€™t hear,â€ she said. â€œBut I suppose they may have told Tolly.â€

Mrs. Ferguson handed down the bottle to herâ€”we were sitting side by side on the bed, that being the only place to sit in the small roomâ€”nearly falling off the bed in the process.

â€œSâ€™pose you could ask him, could you, Maisie?â€ she said.

An uneasy look came into Mrs. Tolliverâ€™s eyes, glazed as they were.

â€œOh, no,â€ she said, shaking her head. â€œHe doesnâ€™t talk to me about such things. Not my business.â€

I exchanged a glance with Mrs. Ferguson, and she shook her head slightly; best not to press the matter now.

Worried as I was, I found it difficult to abandon the subject, but plainly there was nothing to be done. I gathered what shreds of patience I had, estimating how many bottles of gin I could afford before my money ran outâ€”and what I might accomplish with them.



I LAY STILL THAT NIGHT, breathing the damp, thick air with its scents of mold and urine. I could smell Sadie Ferguson next to me, too: a faint miasma of stale sweat, overlaid with a strong perfume of gin. I tried to close my eyes, but every time I did, small waves of claustrophobia washed over me; I could feel the sweating plaster walls draw closer, and gripped my fists in the cloth of the mattress ticking, to keep from throwing myself at the locked door. I had a nasty vision of myself, pounding and shrieking, my nails torn and bloody from clawing at the unyielding wood, my cries unheard in the darknessâ€”and no one ever coming.

I thought it a distinct possibility. I had heard more from Mrs. Ferguson regarding Sheriff Tolliverâ€™s unpopularity. If he were to be attacked and dragged from his home by a mobâ€”or to lose his nerve and runâ€”the chances of him or his wife remembering the prisoners were remote.

A mob might find usâ€”and kill us, in the madness of the moment. Or not find us, and fire the house. The storeroom was clay brick, but the adjoining kitchen was timber; damp or not, the place would burn like a torch, leaving nothing but that bloody brick wall standing.

I took an especially deep breath, smell notwithstanding, exhaled, and shut my eyes with decision.

Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. That had been one of Frankâ€™s favorite expressions, and by and large, a good sentiment.

Depends a bit on the day, though, doesnâ€™t it? I thought in his direction.

Does it? You tell me. The thought was there, vivid enough that I might have heard itâ€”or only imagined it. If I had imagined it, though, I had imagined also a tone of dry amusement that was particularly Frankâ€™s.

Fine, I thought. Reduced to having philosophical arguments with a ghost. Itâ€™s been a worse day than I thought.

Imagination or not, the thought had succeeded in wrenching my attention off the single-minded track of worry. I felt a sense of invitationâ€”or temptation, perhaps. The urge to talk to him. The need to escape into conversation, even if one-sided . . . and imaginary.

No. I wonâ€™t use you that way, I thought, a little sadly. Not right that I should only think of you when I need distraction, and not for your own sake.

And do you never think of me, for my own sake? The question floated in the darkness of my eyelids. I could see his face, quite clearly, the lines of it curved in humor, one dark eyebrow raised. I was dimly surprised; it had been so long since I thought of him in any focused way that I should have long since forgotten exactly what he looked like. But I hadnâ€™t.

And I suppose thatâ€™s the answer to your question, then, I thought silently to him. Good night, Frank.

I turned onto my side, facing the door. I felt a little calmer now. I could just make out the outlines of the door, and being able to see it lessened that feeling of being buried alive.

I closed my eyes again, and tried to concentrate on the processes of my own body. That often helped, bringing me a sense of quiet, listening to the purling of blood through my vessels and the subterranean gurglings of organs all carrying peacefully on without the slightest need of my conscious direction. Rather like sitting in the garden, listening to the bees hum in their hivesâ€”

I stopped that thought in its tracks, feeling my heart jolt in memory, electric as a bee sting.

I thought quite fiercely about my heart, the physical organ, its thick soft chambers and delicate valvesâ€”but what I felt was a soreness there. There were hollow places in my heart.

Jamie. A gaping, echoing hollow, cold and deep as the crevasse of a glacier. Bree. Jemmy. Roger. And Malva, like a tiny, deep-drilled sore, an ulcer that wouldnâ€™t heal.

I had managed so far to ignore the rustlings and heavy breathings of my companion. I couldnâ€™t ignore the hand that brushed my neck, then slipped down my chest and rested lightly, cupped around my breast.

I stopped breathing. Then, very slowly, exhaled. Entirely without my intent, my breast settled into her cupped palm. I felt a touch on my back; a thumb, gently tracing the groove of my spine through my shift.

I understood the need of human comfort, the sheer hunger for touch. I had taken it, often, and given it, part of the fragile web of humanity, constantly torn, constantly made new. But there was that in Sadie Fergusonâ€™s touch that spoke of more than simple warmth, or the need of company in the dark.

I took hold of her hand, and lifting it from my breast, squeezed the fingers gently shut, and put it firmly away from me, folded back against her own bosom.

â€œNo,â€ I said softly.

She hesitated, moved her hips so that her body curved behind me, thighs warm and round against mine, offering encompassment and refuge.

â€œNo one would know,â€ she whispered, still hopeful. â€œI could make you forgetâ€”for a bit.â€ Her hand stroked my hip, gentle, insinuating.

If she could, I thought wryly, I might be tempted. But that pathway was not one I could take.

â€œNo,â€ I said more firmly, and shifted, rolling onto my back, as far away as I could getâ€”which was roughly an inch and a half. â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€”but no.â€

She was silent for a moment, then sighed heavily.

â€œOh, well. Perhaps a bit later.â€

â€œNo!â€

The noises from the kitchen had ceased, and the house settled into silence. It wasnâ€™t the silence of the mountains, though, that cradle of boughs and whispering winds and the vast deep of the starry sky. It was the silence of a town, disturbed by smoke and the fogged dim glow of hearth and candle; filled with slumbering thoughts unleashed from waking reason, roaming and uneasy in the dark.

â€œCould I hold you?â€ she asked wistfully, and her fingers brushed my cheek. â€œOnly that.â€

â€œNo,â€ I said again. But I reached for her hand, and held it. And so we fell asleep, hands chastelyâ€”and firmlyâ€”linked between us.



WE WERE ROUSED BY what I thought at first was the wind, moaning in the chimney whose back bulged into our cubbyhole. The moaning grew louder, though, broke into a full-throated scream, then stopped abruptly.

â€œYe gods and little fishes!â€ Sadie Ferguson sat up, eyes wide and blinking, groping for her spectacles. â€œWhat was that?â€

â€œA woman in labor,â€ I said, having heard that particular pattern of sounds fairly often. The moaning was starting up again. â€œAnd very near her time.â€ I slid off the bed and shook my shoes, dislodging a small roach and a couple of silverfish who had taken shelter in the toes.

We sat for nearly an hour, listening to the alternate moaning and screaming.

â€œShouldnâ€™t it stop?â€ Sadie said, swallowing nervously. â€œShouldnâ€™t the child be birthed by now?â€

â€œPerhaps,â€ I said absently. â€œSome babies take longer than others.â€ I had my ear pressed to the door, trying to make out what was going on on the other side. The woman, whoever she was, was in the kitchen, and no more than ten feet away from me. I heard Maisie Tolliverâ€™s voice now and then, muffled and sounding doubtful. But for the most part, only the rhythmic panting, moaning, and screaming.

Another hour of it, and my nerves were becoming frayed. Sadie was on the bed, the pillow pressed down hard over her head, in hopes of blocking the noise.

Enough of this, I thought, and when next I heard Mrs. Tolliverâ€™s voice, I banged on the door with the heel of my shoe, shouting, â€œMrs. Tolliver!â€ as loudly as I could, to be heard over the noise.

She did hear me, and after a moment, the key grated in the lock and a wave of light and air fell into the cell. I was momentarily blinded by the daylight, but blinked and made out the shape of a woman on her hands and knees by the hearth, facing me. She was black, bathed in sweat, and, raising her head, howled like a wolf. Mrs. Tolliver started as though someone had run a pin into her from behind.

â€œExcuse me,â€ I said, pushing past her. She made no move to stop me, and I caught a strong blast of juniper-scented gin fumes as I brushed by her.

The black woman sank down on her elbows, panting, her uncovered rear in the air. Her belly hung like a ripe guava, pale in the sweat-soaked shift that clung to it.

I asked sharp questions in the brief interval before the next howl, and ascertained that this was her fourth child and that she had been laboring since her water had broken the night before. Mrs. Tolliver contributed the information that she was also a prisoner, and a slave. I might have guessed that, from the purplish weals on her back and buttocks.

Mrs. Tolliver was of little other use, swaying glassy-eyed over me, but had managed to provide a small pile of rags and a basin of water, which I used to mop the womanâ€™s sweating face. Sadie Ferguson poked her bespectacled nose cautiously out of the cell, but drew back hastily when the next howl broke forth.

It was a breech birth, which accounted for the difficulty, and the next quarter-hour was hair-raising for all concerned. At length, though, I eased a small baby into the world, feet first, slimy, motionless, and the most unearthly shade of pale blue.

â€œOh,â€ said Mrs. Tolliver, sounding disappointed. â€œItâ€™s dead.â€

â€œGood,â€ said the mother, in a hoarse, deep voice, and closed her eyes.

â€œDamned if he is,â€ I said, and turned the child hastily facedown, tapping its back. No movement, and I brought the sealed, waxy face to my own, covered nose and mouth with my own mouth, and sucked hard, then turned my head to spit away the mucus and fluid. Face slimy and the taste of silver in my mouth, I blew gently into him, paused, holding him, limp and slippery as a fresh fish, blewâ€”and saw his eyes open, a deeper blue than his skin, vaguely interested.

He took a startled, gasping breath and I laughed, a sudden wellspring of joy bubbling up from my depths. The nightmare memory of another child, a flicker of life blinking out between my hand, faded away. This child was well and truly lit, burning like a candle with a soft, clear flame.

â€œOh!â€ said Mrs. Tolliver, again. She leaned forward to look, and an enormous smile spread across her face. â€œOh, oh!â€

The baby started crying. I cut the cord, wrapped him in some of the rags, and with some reservation, handed him to Mrs. Tolliver, hoping she wouldnâ€™t drop him in the fire. Then I turned my attention to the mother, who was drinking thirstily from the basin, water spilling down her front and soaking the already wet shift further.

She lay back and allowed me to tend her, but without speaking, rolling her eyes occasionally toward the child with a brooding, hostile look.

I heard footsteps coming through the house, and the sheriff appeared, looking surprised.

â€œOh, Tolly!â€ Mrs. Tolliver, smeared with birth fluids and reeking of gin, turned to him happily, holding out the baby to him. â€œLook, Tolly, itâ€™s alive!â€

The sheriff looked quite taken aback, and his brow furrowed as he looked at his wife, but then he seemed to catch the scent of her happiness, above the gin. He leaned forward and touched the little bundle gently, his stern face relaxing.

â€œThatâ€™s good, Maisie,â€ he said. â€œHallo, little fellow.â€ He caught sight of me, then, kneeling on the hearth, doing my best to clean up with a rag and what was left of the water.

â€œMrs. Fraser brought the child,â€ Mrs. Tolliver explained eagerly. â€œIt was laid catty-wumpus, but she brought it so cleverly, and made it breatheâ€”we thought â€™twas dead, it was so still, but it wasnâ€™t! Isnâ€™t that wonderful, Tolly?â€

â€œWonderful,â€ the sheriff repeated a little bleakly. He gave me a hard look, then transferred the same look to the new mother, who gazed back with a sullen indifference. He beckoned me to my feet, then, and with a curt bow, gestured me back into the cell and shut the door.

Only then did I recall what it was he thought Iâ€™d done. Little wonder if my juxtaposition with a newborn child made him a trifle nervous, I supposed. I was wet and filthy, and the cell seemed particularly hot and airless. Nonetheless, the miracle of birth was still tingling through my synapses, and I sat down on the bed, still smiling, a wet rag in my hand.

Sadie was regarding me with respect, mingled with a slight revulsion.

â€œThatâ€™s the messiest business I ever did see,â€ she said. â€œHeavens above, is it always like that?â€

â€œMore or less. Havenâ€™t you ever seen a child born? Youâ€™ve never had one yourself?â€ I asked curiously. She shook her head vigorously, and made the sign of the horns, which made me laugh, giddy as I was.

â€œHad I ever been disposed to let a man near me, the thought of that would dissuade me,â€ she assured me fervently.

â€œOh, yes?â€ I said, belatedly recalling her overtures of the night before. It wasnâ€™t merely comfort sheâ€™d been offering, then. â€œAnd what about Mister Ferguson?â€

She gave me a demure look, blinking through her spectacles.

â€œOh, he was a farmerâ€”much older than I. Dead of the pleurisy, these five years gone.â€

And totally fictitious, I was inclined to think. But a widow had a great deal more freedom than did a maid or a wife, and if ever I saw a woman capable of taking care of herself . . .

I had been paying no attention to the sounds in the kitchen, but at this point, there was a heavy crash and the sheriffâ€™s voice, cursing. No sound of the child or Mrs. Tolliver.

â€œTaking the black bitch back to her quarters,â€ Sadie said, with such a hostile intonation that I glanced at her in amazement.

â€œDidnâ€™t you know?â€ she said, seeing my surprise. â€œSheâ€™s killed her babies. They can hang her, now sheâ€™s borne this one.â€

â€œOh,â€ I said a little blankly. â€œNo. I didnâ€™t know.â€ The noises in the kitchen receded, and I sat staring at the rush dip, the sense of life still moving in my hands.

A REASONABLY

NEAT SCHEME




WATER LAPPED JUST UNDER JAMIEâ€™S EAR, Jamieâ€™s ear, the mere sound of it making him feel queasy. The reek of decaying mud and dead fish didnâ€™t help, nor did the dunt heâ€™d taken when he fell against the wall.

He shifted, trying to find some position that would ease head, stomach, or both. Theyâ€™d trussed him like a boiled fowl, but he managed with some effort to roll onto his side and bring his knees up, which helped a bit.

He was in a dilapidated boat shed of some sort; heâ€™d seen it in the last of the twilight, when theyâ€™d brought him down to the shoreâ€”heâ€™d thought at first they meant to drown himâ€”and carried him inside, dropping him on the floor like a sack of flour.

â€œHurry up, Ian,â€ he muttered, shifting again, in increasing discomfort. â€œIâ€™m a great deal too old for this sort of nonsense.â€

He could only hope his nephew had been close enough when Brown moved to have been able to follow, and to have some notion where he was now; certainly the lad would be looking. The shore where the shed stood was open, no cover, but there was plenty among the brush below Fort Johnston, standing on the headland a little way above him.

The back of his head throbbed dully, giving him a nasty taste in the back of the mouth, and a disquieting echo of the shattering headaches he used to suffer in the wake of an ax wound that had cracked his skull, many years before. He was shocked at how easily the recollection of those headaches came back; it had happened a lifetime ago, and he had thought even the memory of it dead and buried. His skull clearly had a much more vivid memory of its own, though, and was determined to make him sick by way of revenge for his forgetfulness.

The moon was up, and bright; the light shone soft through the cracks between the crude boards of the wall. Dim as it was, it seemed to shift, wavering in a disturbingly qualmish fashion, and he shut his eyes, concentrating grimly on what he might do to Richard Brown, and he got the man alone someday.

Where in the name of Michael and all the saints had he taken Claire, and why? Jamieâ€™s only comfort was that Tom Christie had gone with them. He was fairly sure that Christie wouldnâ€™t let them kill herâ€”and if Jamie could find him, he would lead him to her.

A sound reached him above the nauseating lapping of the tide. Faint whistlingâ€”then singing. He could just make out the words, and smiled a little, in spite of everything. â€œMarry me, marry me, ministerâ€”or else Iâ€™ll be your priest, your priestâ€”or else Iâ€™ll be your priest.â€

He shouted, though it hurt his head, and within a few moments, Ian, the dear wee lad, was beside him, cutting through the ropes. He rolled over, unable for a moment to make his cramped muscles work, then managed to get his hands under him and rise enough to vomit.

â€œAll right, Uncle Jamie?â€ Ian sounded vaguely amused, damn him.

â€œIâ€™ll do. Dâ€™ye ken where Claire is?â€ He got to his feet, swaying, and was fumbling at his breeches; his fingers felt like sausages, and the broken one was throbbing, the pins and needles of returning circulation stabbing through the jagged ends of bone. All discomfort was forgotten for an instant, though, in the rush of overwhelming relief.

â€œJesus, Uncle Jamie,â€ Ian said, impressed. â€œAye, I do. Theyâ€™ve taken her to New Bern. Thereâ€™s a sheriff there that Forbes says might take her.â€

â€œForbes?â€ He swung round in his astonishment, and nearly fell, saving himself with a hand on the creaking wood wall. â€œNeil Forbes?â€

â€œThe very same.â€ Ian caught him with a hand beneath his elbow to steady him; the flimsy board had cracked under his weight. â€œBrown went here and there and talked to this one and thatâ€”but it was Forbes he did business with at last, in Cross Creek.â€

â€œYe heard what they said?â€

â€œI heard.â€ Ianâ€™s voice was casual, but with an underlying excitementâ€”and no little pride in his accomplishment.

Brownâ€™s aim was simple at this pointâ€”to rid himself of the encumbrance the Frasers had become. He knew of Forbes and his relations with Jamie, owing to all the gossip after the tar incident in the summer of last year, and the confrontation at Mecklenberg in May. And so he offered to hand the two of them over to Forbes, for what use the lawyer might make of the situation.

â€œSo he strode to and fro a bit, thinkingâ€”Forbes, I meanâ€”they were in his warehouse, ken, by the river, and me hiding behind the barrels oâ€™ tar. And then he laughs, as though heâ€™s just thought of something clever.â€

Forbesâ€™s suggestion was that Brownâ€™s men should take Jamie, suitably bound, to a small landing that he owned, near Brunswick. From there, he would be taken onto a ship headed for England, and thus safely removed from interference in the affairs of either Forbes or Brownâ€”and, incidentally, rendered unable to defend his wife.

Claire, meanwhile, should be committed to the mercies of the law. If she were to be found guilty, well, that would be the end of her. If not, the scandal attendant upon a trial would both occupy the attention of anyone connected to her and destroy any influence they might haveâ€”thus leaving Fraserâ€™s Ridge ripe for the pickings, and Neil Forbes a clear field toward claiming leadership of the Scottish Whigs in the colony.

Jamie listened to this in silence, torn between anger and a reluctant admiration.

â€œA reasonably neat scheme,â€ he said. He was feeling steadier now, the queasiness disappearing with the cleansing flow of anger through his blood.

â€œOh, it gets better, Uncle,â€ Ian assured him. â€œYe recall a gentleman named Stephen Bonnet?â€

â€œI do. What about him?â€

â€œItâ€™s Mr. Bonnetâ€™s ship, Uncle, thatâ€™s to take ye to England.â€ Amusement was beginning to show in his nephewâ€™s voice again. â€œIt seems Lawyer Forbes has had a verra profitable partnership with Bonnet for some timeâ€”him and some merchant friends in Wilmington. Theyâ€™ve shares in both the ship and its cargoes. And since the English blockade, the profits have been greater still; I take it that our Mr. Bonnet is a most experienced smuggler.â€

Jamie said something extremely foul in French, and went quickly to look out of the shed. The water lay calm and beautiful, a moon path stretching silver out to sea. There was a ship out there; small and black and perfect as a spider on a sheet of paper. Bonnetâ€™s?

â€œChrist,â€ he said. â€œWhen will they come in, dâ€™ye think?â€

â€œI dinna ken,â€ Ian said, sounding unsure for the first time. â€œIs the tide coming in, would ye say, Uncle? Or going out?â€

Jamie glanced down at the water rippling under the boathouse, as though it might offer some clue.

â€œHow would I know, for Godâ€™s sake? And what difference would it make?â€ He rubbed a hand hard over his face, trying to think. Theyâ€™d taken his dirk, of course. He had a sgian dhu, carried in his stocking, but somehow doubted that its three-inch blade would offer much help in the present situation.

â€œWhat have ye got by way of weapons, Ian? Ye dinna have your bow with ye, I donâ€™t suppose?â€

Ian shook his head regretfully. He had joined Jamie in the door of the boathouse, and the moon showed the hunger in his face as he eyed the ship.

â€œIâ€™ve two decent knives, a dirk, and a pistol. Thereâ€™s my rifle, but I left it with the horse.â€ He jerked his head toward the dark line of the distant wood. â€œShall I fetch it? They might see me.â€

Jamie thought for a moment, tapping his fingers against the jamb of the door, â€™til the pain of the broken one made him stop. The urge to lie in wait for Bonnet and take him was a physical thing; he understood Ianâ€™s hunger, and shared it. But his rational mind was busy reckoning the odds, and would insist upon presenting them, little as the vengefully animal part of him wished to know them.

There was not yet any sign of a boat coming from the ship. Always assuming that the ship out there was indeed Bonnetâ€™sâ€”and that, they didnâ€™t know for sureâ€”it might still be hours before anyone came to fetch him away. And when they did, what odds that Bonnet himself would come? He was the shipâ€™s captain; would he come on such an errand, or send minions?

With a rifle, if Bonnet were in the boat, Jamie would wager any amount that he could shoot the man from ambush. If he were in the boat. If he were recognizable in the dark. And while he could hit him, he might not kill him.

If Bonnet were not in the boat, though . . . then it would be a matter of waiting â€™til the boat came close enough, leaping aboard, and overpowering whoever was aboardâ€”how many would come on such an errand? Two, three, four? They must all be killed or disabled, and then it would be a matter of rowing the damn boat back out to the shipâ€”where all aboard would doubtless have noticed the stramash taking place on shore, and be prepared either to drop a cannonball through the bottom of the boat or to wait for them to haul alongside and then pick them off from the rail with small-arms fire, like sitting ducks.

And if they should somehow succeed in getting aboard without noticeâ€”then searching the goddamn ship for Bonnet himself, hunting him down, and killing him, without attracting undue notice from the crew . . .

This laborious analysis ran through his mind in the time it took to breathe, and was as quickly dismissed. If they were to be captured or killed, Claire would be alone and defenseless. He could not risk it. Still, he thought, trying to comfort himself, he could find Forbesâ€”and would, when the time came.

â€œAye, well, then,â€ he said, and turned away with a sigh. â€œHave ye but the one horse, Ian?â€

â€œAye,â€ Ian said with a matching sigh. â€œBut I ken where we can maybe steal another.â€

AMANUENSIS




TWO DAYS PASSED. Hot, damp days in the sweltering dark, and I could feel various kinds of mold, fungus, and rot trying to take hold in my crevicesâ€”to say nothing of the omnivorous, omnipresent cockroaches, who seemed determined to nibble my eyebrows the moment the light was put out. The leather of my shoes was clammy and limp, my hair hung lank and dirty, andâ€”like Sadie Fergusonâ€”I took to spending most of my time in my shift.

When Mrs. Tolliver appeared and ordered us to come assist with the washing, therefore, we abandoned the latest game of looâ€”she was winningâ€”and nearly pushed each other over in our haste to oblige.

It was much hotter in the yard, with the laundry fire roaring, and quite as damp as it had been in the cell, with the thick clouds of moisture boiling off the big kettle of clothes and plastering strands of hair to our faces. Our shifts already clung to our bodies, the grubby linen almost transparent with sweatâ€”laundry was heavy work. There were, however, no bugs, and if the sun shone blinding, and fierce enough to redden my nose and armsâ€”well, it shone, and that was something to be grateful for.

I asked Mrs. Tolliver about my erstwhile patient and her child, but she merely pressed her lips tight and shook her head, looking pinched and severe. The sheriff had been absent the night before; there had been no sound of his booming voice in the kitchen. And from the green-gilled looks of Maisie Tolliver herself, I diagnosed a long and solitary night with the gin bottle, followed by a fairly ghastly dawn.

â€œYouâ€™ll feel much better if you sit in the shade and sip . . . water,â€ I said. â€œLots of water.â€ Tea or coffee would be better, but these substances were more costly than gold in the colony, and I doubted a sheriffâ€™s wife would have any. â€œIf you have any ipecacuanha . . . or perhaps some mint . . .â€

â€œI thank you for your valuable opinion, Mrs. Fraser!â€ she snapped, though she swayed, rather, and her cheeks were pale and glossy with sweat.

I shrugged, and bent my attention to the task of levering a wad of sopping, steaming clothes from the filthy suds with a five-foot wooden laundry spoon, so worn with use that my sweaty hands slipped on the smooth wood.

We got the lot laboriously washed, rinsed, scaldingly wrung, and hung upon a line to dry, then sank gasping into the thin line of shade afforded by the side of the house, and took turns passing a tin dipper back and forth, gulping lukewarm water from the well bucket. Mrs. Tolliver, disregarding her elevated social position, sat down, too, very suddenly.

I turned to offer her the dipper, only to see her eyes roll back into her head. She didnâ€™t so much fall as dissolve backward, subsiding slowly into a heap of damp, checked gingham.

â€œIs she dead?â€ Sadie Ferguson inquired with interest. She glanced to and fro, obviously estimating the chances of making a run for it.

â€œNo. Bad hangover, possibly aggravated by a slight case of sunstroke.â€ Iâ€™d got hold of her pulse, which was light and fast, but quite steady. I was myself debating the wisdom of abandoning Mrs. Tolliver to the dangers of aspirating her own vomit and absconding, even barefoot and in my shift, but was forestalled by male voices coming round the corner of the house.

Two menâ€”one was Tolliverâ€™s constable, whom Iâ€™d seen briefly when Brownâ€™s men had delivered me to the gaol. The other was a stranger, very well dressed, with silver coat buttons and a silk waistcoat, rather the worse for sweat stains. This gentleman, a heavyset sort of about forty, frowned at the scene of dissipation before him.

â€œAre these the prisoners?â€ he asked in tones of distaste.

â€œAye, sir,â€ the constable said. â€œLeastwise, the two in their shifts is. â€™Tother oneâ€™s the sheriffâ€™s wife.â€

Silver Buttonsâ€™s nostrils pinched in briefly in receipt of this intelligence, then flared.

â€œWhich is the midwife?â€

â€œThat would be me,â€ I said, straightening up and trying for an air of dignity. â€œI am Mrs. Fraser.â€

â€œAre you,â€ he said, his tone indicating that I might have said I was Queen Charlotte, for all it mattered to him. He looked me up and down in a disparaging fashion, shook his head, then turned to the sweating constable.

â€œWhat is she charged with?â€

The constable, a rather dim young man, pursed his lips at this, looking dubiously back and forth between us.

â€œAhh . . . well, one of â€™emâ€™s a forger,â€ he said, â€œand â€™totherâ€™s a murderess. But as to which beinâ€™ which . . .â€

â€œIâ€™m the murderess,â€ Sadie said bravely, adding loyally, â€œSheâ€™s a very fine midwife!â€ I looked at her in surprise, but she shook her head slightly and compressed her lips, adjuring me to keep quiet.

â€œOh. Hmm. All right, then. Have you a gown . . . madam?â€ At my nod, he said briefly, â€œGet dressed,â€ and turned to the constable, taking out a vast silk handkerchief from his pocket, with which to wipe his broad pink face. â€œIâ€™ll take her, then. Youâ€™ll tell Mr. Tolliver.â€

â€œI will, sir,â€ the constable assured him, more or less bowing and scraping. He glanced down at the unconscious form of Mrs. Tolliver, then frowned at Sadie.

â€œYou, there. Take her inside and see to her. Hop!â€

â€œOh, yes, sir,â€ Sadie said, and gravely pushed up her sweat-fogged spectacles with one forefinger. â€œRight away, sir!â€

I had no opportunity to speak with Sadie, and barely time enough to struggle into my bedraggled gown and stays and seize my small bag before being escorted into a carriageâ€”rather bedraggled itself, but once of good quality.

â€œWould you mind telling me who you are, and where youâ€™re taking me?â€ I inquired, after we had rattled through two or three cross streets, my companion gazing out the window with an abstracted sort of frown.

My question roused him, and he blinked at me, only then seeming to realize that I was not in fact an inanimate object.

â€œOh. Beg pardon, madam. We are going to the Governorâ€™s Palace. Have you not a cap?â€

â€œNo.â€

He grimaced, as though heâ€™d expected nothing else, and resumed his private thoughts.

Theyâ€™d finished the place, and very nicely, too. William Tryon, the previous governor, had built the Governorâ€™s Palace, but had been sent to New York before construction had been finished. Now the enormous brick edifice with its graceful spreading wings was complete, even to the lawns and ivy beds that lined the drive, though the stately trees that would eventually surround it were mere saplings. The carriage pulled up on the drive, but we did notâ€”of courseâ€”enter by the imposing front entrance, but rather scuttled round the back and down the stairs to the servantsâ€™ quarters in the basement.

Here I was hastily shoved into a maidâ€™s room, handed a comb, basin, and ewer, and a borrowed cap, and urged to make myself look less like a slattern, as quickly as possible.

My guideâ€”Mr. Webb was his name, as I learned from the cookâ€™s respectful greeting to himâ€”waited with obvious impatience while I made my hasty ablutions, then grasped my arm and urged me upstairs. We ascended by a narrow back stair to the second floor, where a very young and frightened-looking maidservant was waiting.

â€œOh, youâ€™ve come, sir, at last!â€ She bobbed a curtsy to Mr. Webb, giving me a curious glance. â€œIs this the midwife?â€

â€œYes. Mrs. Fraserâ€”Dilman.â€ He nodded at the girl, giving only her surname, the English fashion for house servants. She curtsied to me in turn, then beckoned me toward a door that stood ajar.

The room was large and gracious, furnished with a canopied bed, a walnut commode, armoire, and armchair, though the air of elegant refinement was somewhat impaired by a heap of mending, a ratty sewing basket overturned and spilling its threads, and a basket of childrenâ€™s toys. In the bed was a large mound, whichâ€”given the evidence to handâ€”I rather supposed must be Mrs. Martin, the Governorâ€™s wife.

This proved to be the case when Dilman curtsied again, murmuring my name to her. She was roundâ€”very round, given her advanced state of pregnancyâ€”with a small, sharp nose and a nearsighted way of peering that reminded me irresistibly of Beatrix Potterâ€™s Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. In terms of personality, not quite so much.

â€œWho the devil is this?â€ she demanded, poking a frowsy, capped head out of the bedclothes.

â€œMidwife, mum,â€ Dilman said, bobbing again. â€œHave you slept well, mum?â€

â€œOf course not,â€ Mrs. Martin said crossly. â€œThis beastly childâ€™s kicked my liver black and blue, Iâ€™ve puked all night, Iâ€™ve sweated through my sheets, and I have a shaking ague. I was told there was no midwife to be found within the county.â€ She gave me a dyspeptic look. â€œWhere did you discover this person, the local prison?â€

â€œActually, yes,â€ I said, unslinging my bag from my shoulder. â€œHow far gone are you, how long have you been ill, and whenâ€™s the last time you moved your bowels?â€

She looked marginally more interested, and waved Dilman out of the room.

â€œWhat did she say your name was?â€

â€œFraser. Are you experiencing any symptoms of early labor? Cramping? Bleeding? Intermittent pain in the back?â€

She gave me a sideways look, but did begin to answer my questions. From which, in the fullness of time, I eventually was able to diagnose an acute case of food poisoning, likely caused by a leftover slice of oyster pie, consumedâ€”with quite a lot of other ediblesâ€”in a fit of pregnancy-induced greed the day before.

â€œI have not an ague?â€ She withdrew the tongue she had allowed me to inspect, frowning.

â€œYou have not. Not yet, anyway,â€ honesty compelled me to add. It was no wonder she thought she had; I had learned in the course of the examination that a particularly virulent sort of fever was abroad in the townâ€”and in the palace. The Governorâ€™s secretary had died of it two days before, and Dilman was the only upstairs servant still on her feet.

I got her out of bed, and helped her to the armchair, where she subsided, looking like a squashed cream cake. The room was hot and stuffy, and I opened the window in hopes of a breeze.

â€œGodâ€™s teeth, Mrs. Fraser, do you mean to kill me?â€ She clutched her wrapper tight around her belly, hunching her shoulders as though I had admitted a howling blizzard.

â€œProbably not.â€

â€œBut the miasma!â€ She waved a hand at the window, scandalized. In all truth, mosquitoes were a danger. But it was still several hours â€™til sunset, when they would begin to rise.

â€œWeâ€™ll close it in a bit. For the moment, you need air. And possibly something light. Could you stomach a bit of dry toast, do you think?â€

She thought that one over, tasting the corners of her mouth with a tentative tongue tip.

â€œPerhaps,â€ she decided. â€œAnd a cup of tea. Dilman!â€

Dilman dismissed to fetch the tea and toastâ€”how long was it since I had even seen real tea? I wonderedâ€”I settled down to take a more complete medical history.

How many earlier pregnancies? Six, but a shadow crossed her face, and I saw her glance involuntarily at a wooden puppet, lying near the hearth.

â€œAre your children in the palace?â€ I asked, curious. I had heard no sign of any children, and even in a place the size of the palace, it would be difficult to hide six of them.

â€œNo,â€ she said with a sigh, and put her hands on her belly, holding it almost absently. â€œWe sent the girls to my sister in New Jersey, a few weeks ago.â€

A few more questions, and the tea and toast arrived. I left her to eat it in peace, and went to shake out the damp, crumpled bedclothes.

â€œIs it true?â€ Mrs. Martin asked suddenly, startling me.

â€œIs what true?â€

â€œThey say you murdered your husbandâ€™s pregnant young mistress, and cut the baby from her womb. Did you?â€

I put the heel of my hand against my brow and pressed, closing my eyes. How on earth had she heard that? When I thought I could speak, I lowered my hands and opened my eyes.

â€œShe wasnâ€™t his mistress, and I didnâ€™t kill her. As for the restâ€”yes, I did,â€ I said as calmly as I could.

She stared at me for a moment, her mouth hanging open. Then she shut it with a snap and crossed her forearms over her belly.

â€œTrust George Webb to choose me a proper midwife!â€ she saidâ€”and much to my surprise, began to laugh. â€œHe doesnâ€™t know, does he?â€

â€œI would assume not,â€ I said with extreme dryness. â€œI didnâ€™t tell him. Who told you?â€

â€œOh, you are quite notorious, Mrs. Fraser,â€ she assured me. â€œEveryone has been talking of it. George has no time for gossip, but even he must have heard of it. He has no memory for names, though. I do.â€

A little color was coming back into her face. She took another nibble of toast, chewed, and swallowed gingerly.

â€œI was not sure that it was you, though,â€ she admitted. â€œNot until I asked.â€ She closed her eyes, grimacing doubtfully, but evidently the toast hit bottom, for she opened them and resumed her nibbling.

â€œSo now that you do know . . . ?â€ I asked delicately.

â€œI donâ€™t know. Iâ€™ve never known a murderess before.â€ She swallowed the last of the toast and licked the tips of her fingers before wiping them on the napkin.

â€œI am not a murderess,â€ I said.

â€œWell, of course youâ€™d say so,â€ she agreed. She took up the cup of tea, surveying me over it with interest. â€œYou donâ€™t look depravedâ€”though I must say, you donâ€™t look quite respectable, either.â€ She raised the fragrant cup and drank, with a look of bliss that made me conscious that I hadnâ€™t eaten anything since the rather meager bowl of unsalted, unbuttered porridge provided for breakfast by Mrs. Tolliver.

â€œIâ€™ll have to think about it,â€ Mrs. Martin said, setting down her cup with a clink. â€œTake that back to the kitchen,â€ she said, waving at the tray, â€œand have them send me up some soup, and perhaps a few sandwiches. I do believe my appetite has come back!â€



WELL, NOW BLOODY WHAT? I had been whisked so abruptly from gaol to palace that I felt like a sailor decanted onto land after months at sea, staggering and off-balance. I went obediently down to the kitchen, as instructed, obtained a trayâ€”with a most delectable-smelling bowl of soupâ€”and took it back to Mrs. Martin, walking like an automaton. By the time she dismissed me, my brain had begun to function again, if not yet at full capacity.

I was in New Bern. And, thanks be to God and Sadie Ferguson, out of Sheriff Tolliverâ€™s noisome gaol. Fergus and Marsali were in New Bern. Ergo, the obviousâ€”in fact, the onlyâ€”thing to do was plainly to escape and find my way to them. They could help me to find Jamie. I clung firmly to Tom Christieâ€™s promise that Jamie wasnâ€™t dead and to the notion that he was findable, because nothing else was tolerable.

Escaping from the Governorâ€™s Palace, though, proved more difficult than I had anticipated. There were guards posted at all the doors, and my attempt to talk my way past one of them failed utterly, leading to the abrupt appearance of Mr. Webb, who took me by the arm and escorted me firmly up the stairs to a hot, stuffy little garret, where he locked me in.

It was better than the gaol, but that was all that could be said for it. There was a cot, a chamber pot, a basin, ewer, and chest of drawers, the latter containing meager bits of clothing. The room showed signs of recent occupancyâ€”but not immediately recent. A film of fine summer dust lay over everything, and while the ewer was full of water, it had obviously been there for some time; a number of moths and other small insects had drowned in it, and a film of the same fine dust floated on the surface.

There was also a small window, painted shut, but determined banging and heaving got it open, and I breathed a heady lungful of hot, muggy air.

I stripped off, removed the dead moths from the pitcher, and washed, a blissful experience that made me feel immensely better, after the last week of unalloyed grime, sweat, and filth. After a momentâ€™s hesitation, I helped myself to a worn linen shift from the chest of drawers, unable to bear the thought of putting my own filthy, sweat-soaked chemise back on.

I could do only so much without soap or shampoo, but even so, felt much improved, and stood by the window, combing out my wet hairâ€”there had been a wooden comb on the chest, though no looking glassâ€”and surveying what I could see from my perch.

There were more guards, posted round the edge of the property. Was that usual? I wondered. I thought perhaps it was not; they seemed uneasy, and very alert; I saw one challenge a man who approached the gate, presenting his weapon in rather belligerent fashion. The man seemed startled and backed up, then turned and walked away fast, glancing backward as he went.

There were a number of uniformed guardsâ€”I thought they were perhaps Marines, though I wasnâ€™t sufficiently familiar with uniforms as to be sure of itâ€”clustered round six cannon, these situated on a slight rise before the palace, commanding the town and the harborâ€™s edge.

There were two nonuniformed men among them; leaning out a bit, I made out the tall, heavyset figure of Mr. Webb, and a shorter man beside him. The shorter man was strolling along the line of cannon, hands folded beneath his coattails, and the Marines, or whatever they were, were saluting him. At a guess, this was the Governor, then: Josiah Martin.

I watched for a little while, but nothing of interest happened, and I found myself overwhelmed with sudden sleepiness, borne down by the strains of the last month and the hot, still air that seemed to press upon me like a hand.

I lay down on the cot in my borrowed shift, and fell instantly asleep.



I SLEPT UNTIL THE middle of the night, when I was again called to attend Mrs. Martin, who seemed to be having a relapse of her digestive difficulties. A slightly pudgy, long-nosed man in nightshirt and cap lurked in the doorway with a candle, looking worried; I took this to be the Governor. He looked hard at me, but made no move to interfere, and I had no time to take much notice of him. By the time the crisis had passed, the Governorâ€”if indeed it was heâ€”had disappeared. The patient now safely asleep, I lay down like a dog on the rug beside her bed, with a rolled-up petticoat as pillow, and went thankfully back to sleep.

It was full daylight when I woke again, and the fire was out. Mrs. Martin was out of bed, calling fretfully into the passage for Dilman.

â€œWretched girl,â€ she said, turning back as I got awkwardly to my feet. â€œGot the ague, I suppose, like the rest. Or run away.â€

I gathered that while several servants were down with the fever, a good many of the others had simply decamped out of fear of contagion.

â€œYouâ€™re quite sure I have not got the tertian ague, Mrs. Fraser?â€ Mrs. Martin squinted at herself in her looking glass, putting out her tongue and surveying it critically. â€œI do believe I look yellow.â€

In fact, her complexion was a soft English pink, though rather pale from throwing up.

â€œKeep off the cream cakes and oyster pie in hot weather, donâ€™t eat anything larger than your head at one sitting, and you should be quite all right,â€ I said, suppressing a yawn. I caught a look at myself in the glass, over her shoulder, and shuddered. I was nearly as pale as she was, with dark circles under my eyes, and my hair . . . well, it was almost clean, that was all that could be said for it.

â€œI should be let blood,â€ Mrs. Martin declared. â€œThat is the proper treatment for a plethory; dear Dr. Sibelius always says so. Three or four ounces, perhaps, to be followed by the black draught. Dr. Sibelius says he finds the black-draught answer very well in such cases.â€ She moved to an armchair and reclined, her belly bulging under her wrapper. She pulled up the sleeve of the wrapper, extending her arm in languorous fashion. â€œThere is a fleam and bowl in the top left drawer, Mrs. Fraser. If you would oblige me?â€

The mere thought of letting blood first thing in the morning was enough to make me want to vomit. As for Dr. Sibeliusâ€™s black draught, that was laudanumâ€”an alcoholic tincture of opium, and not my treatment of choice for a pregnant woman.

The subsequent acrimonious discussion over the virtues of blood-lettingâ€”and I began to think, from the anticipatory gleam in her eye, that the thrill of having a vein opened by a murderess was what she actually desiredâ€”was interrupted by the unceremonious entry of Mr. Webb.

â€œDo I disturb you, mum? My apologies.â€ He bowed perfunctorily to Mrs. Martin, then turned to me. â€œYouâ€”put on your cap and come with me.â€

I did so without protest, leaving Mrs. Martin indignantly unperforated.

Webb ushered me down the gleamingly polished front stair this time, and into a large, gracious, book-lined room. The Governor, now properly wigged, powdered, and elegantly suited, was seated behind a desk overflowing with papers, dockets, scattered quills, blotters, sand-shakers, sealing wax, and all the other impedimenta of an eighteenth-century bureaucrat. He looked hot, bothered, and quite as indignant as his wife.

â€œWhat, Webb?â€ he demanded, scowling at me. â€œI need a secretary, and you bring me a midwife?â€

â€œSheâ€™s a forger,â€ Webb said baldly. That stopped whatever complaint the Governor had been going to bring forth. He paused, mouth slightly open, still frowning at me.

â€œOh,â€ he said in an altered tone. â€œIndeed.â€

â€œAccused of forgery,â€ I said politely. â€œI havenâ€™t been tried, let alone convicted, you know.â€

The Governorâ€™s eyebrows went up, hearing my educated accent.

â€œIndeed,â€ he said again, more slowly. He looked me up and down, squinting dubiously. â€œWhere on earth did you get her, Webb?â€

â€œFrom the gaol.â€ Webb cast me an indifferent glance, as though I might be some unprepossessing yet useful bit of furniture, like a chamber pot. â€œWhen I made inquiries for a midwife, someone told me that this woman had done prodigies with a slave, another prisoner, having a difficult lying-in. And as the matter was urgent, and no other cunning woman to be found . . .â€ He shrugged, with a faint grimace.

â€œHmmmm.â€ The Governor pulled a handkerchief from his sleeve and dabbed thoughtfully at the plump flesh beneath his chin. â€œCan you write a fair hand?â€

I supposed it would be a poor forger who couldnâ€™t, but contented myself with saying, â€œYes.â€ Fortunately, it was true; in my own time, I had scribbled ball-point prescriptions with the best of them, but now I had trained myself to write clearly with a quill, so that my medical records and case notes should be legible, for the benefit of whoever should read them after me. Once again, I felt a sharp pang at the thought of Malvaâ€”but there was no time to think of her.

Still eyeing me speculatively, the Governor nodded toward a straight-backed chair and a smaller desk at the side of the room.

â€œSit.â€ He rose, scrabbled among the papers on his desk, and deposited one in front of me. â€œLet me see you make a fair copy of that, if you please.â€

It was a brief letter to the Royal Council, outlining the Governorâ€™s concerns regarding recent threats to that body, and postponing the next scheduled meeting of the council. I chose a quill from the cut-glass holder on the desk, found a silver penknife by it, trimmed the quill to my liking, uncorked the inkwell, and set about the business, deeply aware of the scrutiny of the two men.

I didnâ€™t know how long my imposture might hold upâ€”Mrs. Governor could blow the gaff at any timeâ€”but for the nonce, I thought I probably had a better chance of escape as an accused forger than as an accused murderer.

The Governor took my finished copy, surveyed it, and laid it on the desk with a small grunt of satisfaction.

â€œGood enough,â€ he said. â€œMake eight further copies of that, and then you can go on with these.â€ Turning back to his own desk, he shuffled together a large sheaf of correspondence, which he deposited in front of me.

The two menâ€”I had no notion of Webbâ€™s office, but he was obviously the Governorâ€™s close friendâ€”returned to a discussion of current business, ignoring me completely.

I went about my assigned task mechanically, finding the scratch of the quill, the ritual of sanding, blotting, shaking, soothing. Copying occupied a very small part of my mind; the rest was free to worry about Jamie, and to think how best to engineer an escape.

I couldâ€”and doubtless shouldâ€”make an excuse after a bit to go and see how Mrs. Martin did. If I could make shift to do so unaccompanied, I would have a few moments of unobserved freedom, during which to make a surreptitious dash for the nearest exit. So far, though, every door Iâ€™d seen had been guarded. The Governorâ€™s Palace had a very well-stocked simples closet, alas; it would be hard to invent a need for anything from an apothecaryâ€”and even then, unlikely that theyâ€™d let me go alone to fetch it.

Waiting for nightfall seemed the best notion; at least if I did get out of the palace, I would have several hours before my absence was noted. If they locked me in again, though . . .

I scratched away assiduously, turning over various unsatisfactory plans, and trying very hard not to envision Jamieâ€™s body turning slowly in the wind, hanging from a tree in some lonely hollow. Christie had given me his word; I clung to that, having nothing else to cling to.

Webb and the Governor murmured together, but their talk was of things I had no notion of, and for the most part, it washed over me like the sound of the sea, meaningless and soothing. After some time, though, Webb came over to instruct me in the sealing and direction of those letters to be sent. I thought of asking why he didnâ€™t lend a hand himself in this clerical emergency, but then saw his handsâ€”both badly twisted with arthritis.

â€œYou write a very fair hand, Mrs. Fraser,â€ he unbent enough to say, at one point, and gave me a brief, wintry smile. â€œIt is unfortunate that you should have been the forger, rather than the murderess.â€

â€œWhy?â€ I asked, rather astonished at that.

â€œWhy, you are plainly literate,â€ he said, surprised in turn at my astonishment. â€œIf convicted of murder, you could plead benefit of clergy, and be let off with a public whipping and branding in the face. Forgery, thoughâ€”â€ He shook his head, pursing his lips. â€œCapital crime, no pardon possible. If convicted of forgery, Mrs. Fraser, I am afraid you must be hanged.â€

My feelings of gratitude toward Sadie Ferguson underwent an abrupt reappraisal.

â€œIndeed,â€ I said as coolly as possible, though my heart had given a convulsive leap and was now trying to burrow out of my chest. â€œWell, weâ€™ll hope that justice is served then, and I am released, wonâ€™t we?â€

He made a choked sound that I thought passed for a laugh.

â€œTo be sure. If only for the Governorâ€™s sake.â€

After that, we resumed work silently. The gilded clock behind me struck noon, and as though summoned by the sound, a servant whom I took to be the butler came in, to inquire whether the Governor would receive a delegation of the townâ€™s citizens?

The Governorâ€™s mouth compressed a bit, but he nodded in resignation, and a group of six or seven men came in, all attired in their best coats, but plainly tradesmen, rather than merchants or lawyers. None I recognized, thank God.

â€œWe have come, sir,â€ said one, who introduced himself as George Herbert, â€œto ask the meaning of this movement of the cannon.â€

Webb, sitting next to me, stiffened a little, but the Governor seemed to have been prepared for this.

â€œThe cannon?â€ he said with every evidence of innocent surprise. â€œWhyâ€”the mountings are being repaired. We shall fire a royal saluteâ€”as usualâ€”in honor of the Queenâ€™s birthday, later in the month. Upon inspecting the cannon in anticipation of this, though, it was discovered that the wood of the caissons had rotted away in spots. Firing the cannon is of course impossible until repairs shall be effected. Would you wish to inspect the mountings for yourself, sir?â€

He half-rose from his seat as he said this, as though personally to escort them outside, but spoke with such a tinge of irony to his courtesy that they flushed and muttered refusals.

There was a bit more back and forth, in the name of courtesy, but the delegation then left, exhibiting only marginally less suspicion than that with which theyâ€™d come in. Webb closed his eyes and exhaled audibly, as the door closed behind them.

â€œGod damn them,â€ said the Governor very softly. I didnâ€™t think he meant it to be heard, and pretended I hadnâ€™t, busying myself with the papers and keeping my head lowered.

Webb got up and went to the window that overlooked the lawn, presumably to assure himself that the cannon were where he thought they should be. By craning a bit, I could see past him; sure enough, the six cannon had been removed from their mountings and lay on the grass, harmless logs of bronze.

From the subsequent conversationâ€”salted with strong remarks regarding rebellious dogs who had the temerity to put the question to a Royal Governor as though he were a bootblack, by God!â€”I gathered that in fact, the cannon had been removed because of a very real fear that the townspeople might seize them and turn them upon the palace itself.

It dawned on me, listening to all this, that things had gone further and moved faster than I had expected. It was mid-July, but of 1775â€”nearly a year before a larger and more forceful version of the Mecklenberg Declaration would flower into an official declaration of independence for the united colonies. And yet here was a Royal Governor, in obvious fear of open revolt.

If what we had seen on our journey south from the Ridge had not been enough to convince me that war was now upon us, a day spent with Governor Martin left no doubt.

I did go up in the afternoonâ€”accompanied by the watchful Webb, alasâ€”to check my patient, and to make inquiries regarding anyone else who might be ill. Mrs. Martin was torpid and low in spirits, complaining of the heat and the pestilential, wretched climate, missing her daughters, and suffering severely from a lack of personal service, having been obliged to brush her own hair in the absence of Dilman, who had vanished. She was, however, in good health, as I was able to report to the Governor, who asked me of it upon my return.

â€œWould she stand a journey, do you think?â€ he asked, frowning a bit.

I considered for a moment, then nodded.

â€œI think so. Sheâ€™s a bit wobbly, still, from the digestive upsetâ€”but she should be quite well again by tomorrow. I see no difficulties with the pregnancyâ€”tell me, had she any trouble with previous confinements?â€

The Governorâ€™s face flushed rosily at that, but he shook his head.

â€œI thank you, Mrs. Fraser,â€ he said with a slight inclination of the head. â€œYou will excuse me, Georgeâ€”I must go and speak to Betsy.â€

â€œIs he thinking of sending his wife away?â€ I asked Webb, in the wake of the Governorâ€™s departure. Despite the heat, a small qualm of uneasiness stirred beneath my skin.

For once, Webb seemed quite human; he was frowning after the Governor, and nodded absently.

â€œHe has family in New York and New Jersey. Sheâ€™ll be safe there, with the girls. Her three daughters,â€ he explained, catching my eye.

â€œThree? She said sheâ€™d had sixâ€”ah.â€ I stopped abruptly. She said she had borne six children, not that she had six living children.

â€œThey have lost three small sons to the fevers here,â€ Webb said, still looking after his friend. He shook his head, sighing. â€œIt hasnâ€™t been a fortunate place for them.â€

He seemed then to recover himself, and the man disappeared back behind the mask of the chilly bureaucrat. He handed me another sheaf of papers, and went out, not bothering to bow.





93




IN WHICH I IMPERSONATE

A LADY




I ATE SUPPER ALONE IN MY ROOM; the cook seemed still to be functioning, at least, though the atmosphere of disorder in the house was a palpable thing. I could feel the uneasiness, bordering on panicâ€”and had the thought that it wasnâ€™t fear of fever or ague that had caused the servants to leave, but more likely that sense of self-preservation that causes rats to flee a sinking ship.

From my tiny window, I could see a small portion of the town, apparently serene in the gathering twilight. The light was very different here from that in the mountainsâ€”a flat, dimensionless light that limned the houses and the fishing boats in the harbor with a hard-edged clarity, but faded into a haze that hid the farther shore completely, so that I looked beyond the immediate prospect into featureless infinity.

I shook off the notion, and took from my pocket the ink, quill, and paper I had abstracted from the library earlier. I had no idea whether or how I might get a note out of the palaceâ€”but I did have a little money, still, and if the opportunity offered . . .

I wrote quickly to Fergus and Marsali, telling them briefly what had happened, urging Fergus to make inquiries for Jamie in Brunswick and Wilmington.

I thought myself that if Jamie was alive, that he was most likely in the Wilmington gaol. Brunswick was a tiny settlement, dominated by the looming presence of the log-built Fort Johnston, but the fort was a militia garrison; there would be no good reason to take Jamie thereâ€”though if they had . . . the fort was under the command of a Captain Collet, a Swiss emigrant who knew him. At least he would be safe there.

Who else did he know? He had a good many acquaintances on the coast, from the days of the Regulation. John Ashe, for one; they had marched side by side to Alamance, and Asheâ€™s company had camped next to ours every night; we had entertained him at our campfire many times. And Ashe was from Wilmington.

I had just finished a brief plea to John Ashe, when I heard footsteps coming down the hallway toward my room. I folded it hastily, not worrying about smearing, and thrust it with the other note into my pocket. There was no time to do anything with the contraband ink and paper, save push it under the bed.

It was Webb, of course, my customary jailer. Evidently, I was now considered the general dogsbody of the establishment; I was escorted to Mrs. Martinâ€™s room and desired to pack her things.

I might have expected complaint or hysteria, but in fact, she was not only dressed but pale-faced and composed, directing and even assisting the process with a sense of clear-minded order.

The reason for her self-possession was the Governor, who came in midway through the packing, his face drawn with worry. She went at once to him, and put her hands affectionately on his shoulders.

â€œPoor Jo,â€ she said softly. â€œHave you had any supper?â€

â€œNo. It doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™ll have a bite later.â€ He kissed her briefly on the forehead, his look of worry lightening a little as he looked at her. â€œYouâ€™re quite well now, Betsy? Youâ€™re sure of it?â€ I realized suddenly that he was Irishâ€”Anglo-Irish, at least; he had no hint of an accent, but his unguarded speech held a faint lilt.

â€œEntirely recovered,â€ she assured him. She took his hand and pressed it to her bulge, smiling. â€œSee how he kicks?â€

He smiled back, raised her hand to his lips, and kissed it.

â€œIâ€™ll miss you, darling,â€ she said very softly. â€œYou will take very great care?â€

He blinked rapidly, and looked down, swallowing.

â€œOf course,â€ he said gruffly. â€œDear Betsy. You know I could not bear to part with you, unlessâ€”â€

â€œI do know. Thatâ€™s why I fear so greatly for you. Iâ€”â€ At this point, she looked up, and realized suddenly that I was there. â€œMrs. Fraser,â€ she said in quite a different tone. â€œGo down to the kitchen, please, and have a tray prepared for the Governor. You may take it to the library.â€

I bobbed slightly, and went. Was this the chance I had been waiting for?

The halls and stairway were deserted, lit only by flickering tin sconcesâ€”burning fish oil, by the smell. The brick-walled kitchen was, course, in the basement, and the eerie silence in what should ordinarily be a hive of activity made the unlighted kitchen stairway seem like the descent into a dungeon.

There was no light in the kitchen now save the hearth fire, burning lowâ€”but it was burning, three servants clustered near it despite the smothering heat. They turned at my footsteps, startled and faceless in silhouette. With steam rising from the cauldron behind them, I had the momentary delusion that I was facing Macbethâ€™s three witches, met in dreadful prophecy.

â€œDouble, double, toil and trouble,â€ I said pleasantly, though my heart beat a little faster as I approached them. â€œFire burn, and cauldron bubble.â€

â€œToil and trouble, that be right,â€ said a soft female voice, and laughed. Closer now, I could see that they had appeared faceless in the shadows because they were all black; slaves, likely, and thus unable to flee the house.

Unable also to carry a message for me. Still, it never hurt to be friendly, and I smiled at them.

They smiled shyly back, looking at me with curiosity. I had not seen any of them beforeâ€”nor they me, though â€œdownstairsâ€ being what it was, I thought it likely they knew who I was.

â€œGovernor be sendinâ€™ his lady away?â€ asked the one who had laughed, moving to fetch down a tray from a shelf in response to my request for something light.

â€œYes,â€ I said. I realized the value of gossip as currency, and related everything that I decently could, as the three of them moved efficiently about, dark as shadows, their darting hands slicing, spreading, arranging.

Molly, the cook, shook her head, her white cap like a sunset cloud in the fireâ€™s glow.

â€œBad times, bad times,â€ she said, clicking her tongue, and the other two murmured assent. I thought, from their attitude, that they liked the Governorâ€”but then, as slaves, their fate was inextricably linked with his, regardless of their feelings.

It occurred to me, as we chatted, that even if they could not reasonably flee the house altogether, they might at least leave the premises now and again; someone had to do the marketing, and there seemed to be no one else left. In fact, this proved to be the case; Sukie, the one who had laughed, went out to buy fish and fresh vegetables in the mornings, and tactfully approached, was not averse to delivering my notes to the printshopâ€”she said she knew where it was, the place with all the books in the windowâ€”for a small consideration.

She tucked away the paper and money in her bosom, giving me a knowing look, and winked. God knew what she thought it was, but I winked back, and hefting the loaded tray, made my way back up into the fishy-smelling realms of light.

I found the Governor alone in the library, burning papers. He nodded absently at the tray I set on the desk, but did not touch it. I wasnâ€™t sure what to do, and after a momentâ€™s awkward standing about, sat down at my accustomed place.

The Governor thrust a final sheaf of documents into the fire, then stood looking bleakly after them, as they blackened and curled. The room had cooled a little, with the setting sun, but the windows were tightly shutâ€”of courseâ€”and rivulets of condensing moisture rolled down the ornamental panes of glass. Blotting a similar condensation from my cheeks and nose, I got up and threw open the window closest to me, drawing in a deep gulp of the evening air, cloyingly warm, but fresh, and sweet with honeysuckle and roses from the garden, undercut with dankness from the distant shore.

Woodsmoke, too; there were fires burning outside. The soldiers who guarded the palace had watch fires burning, evenly spaced around the perimeter of the grounds. Well, that would help with the mosquitoesâ€”and we would not be completely surprised, if an attack should come.

The Governor came to stand behind me. I expected him to tell me to shut the window, but he merely stood, looking out across his lawns and the long, graveled drive. The moon had risen, and the dismounted cannon were dimly visible, lying in the shadows like dead men in a row.

After a moment, the Governor moved back to his desk, and calling me over, handed me a sheaf of official correspondence for copying, another for sorting and filing. He left the window open; I thought that he wished to hear, if anything should happen.

I wondered where the omnipresent Webb was. There was no sound from elsewhere in the Palace; presumably Mrs. Martin had finished her packing alone, and gone to bed.

We worked on, through the intermittent chiming of the clock, the Governor getting up now and then to commit another batch of papers to the fire, taking my copies and bundling them into large leather folders that he bound with tape, stacking them on his desk. He had taken off his wig; his hair was brown, short but curlyâ€”rather like my own had been, after the fever. Now and then he paused, head turned, listening.

I had faced a mob, and knew what he was listening for. I didnâ€™t know what to hope for, at this point, or to fear. And so I worked on, welcoming the work for the numbing distraction it was, though my hand had grown desperately cramped, and I had to pause every few moments to rub it.

The Governor was writing now; he shifted in his chair, grimacing with discomfort in spite of the cushion. Mrs. Martin had told me that he suffered from a fistula. I doubted very much that heâ€™d let me treat it.

He eased himself onto one buttock, and rubbed a hand down his face. It was late, and he was plainly tired, as well as uncomfortable. I was tired, too, stifling yawns that threatened to dislocate my jaw and left my eyes watering. He kept doggedly working, though, with occasional glances at the door. Who was he expecting?

The window at my back was still open, and the soft air caressed me, warm as blood, but moving enough to stir the wisps of hair on my neck and make the candle flame waver wildly. It bent to one side and flickered, as though it would go out, and the Governor reached quickly to shelter it with a cupped hand.

The breeze passed and the air fell still again, save for the sound of crickets outside. The Governorâ€™s attention seemed focused on the paper before him, but suddenly his head turned sharply, as though he had seen something dart past the open door.

He looked for a moment, then blinked, rubbed his eyes, and returned his attention to the paper. But he couldnâ€™t keep it there. He glanced again at the empty doorwayâ€”I couldnâ€™t help looking, tooâ€”then back, blinking.

â€œDid you . . . see someone pass, Mrs. Fraser?â€ he asked.

â€œNo, sir,â€ I said, nobly swallowing a yawn.

â€œAh.â€ Seeming somehow disappointed, he took up his quill, but didnâ€™t write anything, just held it between his fingers, as though he had forgotten it was there.

â€œWere you expecting anyone, Your Excellency?â€ I asked politely, and his head jerked up, surprised to be directly addressed.

â€œOh. No. That is . . .â€ His voice died away as he glanced once more at the doorway that led to the back of the house.

â€œMy son,â€ he said. â€œOur darling Sam. Heâ€”died here, you knowâ€”late last year. Only eight years old. Sometimes . . . sometimes I think I see him,â€ he ended quietly, and bent his head once more over his paper, lips pressed tight.

I moved impulsively, meaning to touch his hand, but his tight-lipped air prevented me.

â€œI am sorry,â€ I said quietly, instead. He didnâ€™t speak, but gave one quick, short nod of acknowledgment, not raising his head. His lips tightened further, and he went back to his writing, as did I.

A little later, the clock struck the hour, then two. It had a soft, sweet chime, and the Governor stopped to listen, a distant look in his eyes.

â€œSo late,â€ he said, as the last chime died away. â€œI have kept you intolerably late, Mrs. Fraser. Forgive me.â€ He motioned to me to leave the papers I was working on, and I rose, stiff and aching from sitting so long.

I shook my skirts into some order and turned to go, realizing only then that he had made no move to put away his ink and quills.

â€œYou should go to bed, too, you know,â€ I said to him, turning and pausing at the door.

The palace was still. Even the crickets had ceased, and only the soft snore of a sleeping soldier in the hall disturbed the quiet.

â€œYes,â€ he said, and gave me a small, tired smile. â€œSoon.â€ He shifted his weight to the other buttock, and picked up his quill, bending his head once more over the papers.



NO ONE WOKE ME in the morning, and the sun was well up when I stirred on my own. Listening to the silence, I had a momentary fear that everyone had decamped in the night, leaving me locked in to starve. I rose hastily, though, and looked out. The red-coated soldiers were still patrolling the grounds, just as usual. I could see small groups of citizens outside the perimeter, mostly strolling past in twos or threes, but sometimes stopping to stare at the palace.

Then I began to hear small thumps and homely noises on the floor below, and felt relieved; I was not entirely abandoned. I was, however, extremely hungry by the time the butler came to let me out.

He brought me to Mrs. Martinâ€™s bedchamber, but to my surprise it was empty. He left me there, and within a few moments, Merilee, one of the kitchen slaves, came in, looking apprehensive at being in this unfamiliar part of the house.

â€œWhatever is going on?â€ I asked her. â€œWhere is Mrs. Martin, do you know?â€

â€œWell, I know that,â€ she said, in a dubious tone indicating that it was the only thing she did know for certain. â€œShe lefâ€™ just afore dawn this morninâ€™. That Mr. Webb, he took her away, secret-like, in a wagon with her boxes.â€

I nodded, perplexed. It was reasonable that she should have left quietly; I imagined the Governor didnâ€™t want to give any indication that he felt threatened, for fear of provoking exactly the violence he feared.

â€œBut if Mrs. Martin is gone,â€ I said, â€œwhy am I here? Why are you here?â€

â€œOh. Well, I know that, too,â€ Merilee said, gaining a bit of confidence. â€œI sâ€™posed to hep you dress, maâ€™am.â€

â€œBut I donâ€™t need any . . .â€ I began, and then saw the garments laid out on the bed: one of Mrs. Martinâ€™s day gowns, a pretty printed floral cotton, done in the newly popular â€œpolonaiseâ€ fashion, complete with voluminous petticoats, silk stockings, and a large straw hat to shade the face.

Evidently, I was meant to impersonate the Governorâ€™s wife. There was no real point in protesting; I could hear the Governor and the butler talking in the hall, and after allâ€”if it got me out of the palace, so much the better.

I was only two or three inches taller than Mrs. Martin, and my lack of a bulge made the gown hang lower. There was no hope of my fitting into any of her shoes, but my own were not completely disreputable, in spite of all my adventures since leaving home. Merilee cleaned them and rubbed them with a bit of grease to make the leather shine; they were at least not so crude as to draw attention immediately.

With the broad-brimmed hat slanting forward to hide my face, and my hair twisted up and firmly pinned under a cap beneath it, I was probably a reasonable approximation, at least to people who did not know Mrs. Martin well. The Governor frowned when he saw me, and walked slowly round me, tugging here and there to adjust the fit, but then nodded, and with a small bow, offered me his arm.

â€œYour servant, mum,â€ he said politely. And with me slumping slightly to disguise my height, we went out the front door, to find the Governorâ€™s carriage waiting in the drive.

ABSQUATULATION




JAMIE FRASER observed the quantity and quality of books in the window of the printshopâ€”F. Fraser, Proprietorâ€”and allowed himself a momentary sense of pride in Fergus; the establishment, though small, was apparently thriving. Time, however, was pressing, and he pushed through the door without stopping to read the titles.

A small bell over the door rang at his entrance, and Germain popped up behind the counter like an ink-smeared jack-in-the-box, emitting a whoop of joy at sight of his grandfather and his uncle Ian.

â€œGrandpÃ¨re, GrandpÃ¨re!â€ he shouted, then dived under the flap in the counter, clutching Jamie about the hips in ecstasy. Heâ€™d grown; the top of his head now reached Jamieâ€™s lower ribs. Jamie ruffled the shiny blond hair gently, then detached Germain and told him to fetch his father.

No need; aroused by the shouting, the whole family came boiling out from the living quarters behind the shop, exclaiming, yelling, squealing, and generally carrying on like a pack of wolves, as Ian pointed out to them, Henri-Christian riding on his shoulders in red-faced triumph, clinging to his hair.

â€œWhat has happened, milord? Why are you here?â€ Fergus disengaged Jamie easily from the riot and drew him aside, into the alcove where the more expensive books were keptâ€”and those not suitable for public display.

He could see from the look on Fergusâ€™s face that some news had come down from the mountains; while surprised to see him, Fergus was not astonished, and his pleasure covered a worried mind. He explained the matter as quickly as he could, stumbling now and then over his words from haste and weariness; one of the horses had broken down some forty miles from town, and unable to find another, they had walked for two nights and a day, taking it in turns to ride, the other trotting alongside, clinging to the stirrup leathers.

Fergus listened with attention, wiping his mouth with the handkerchief he had taken from his collar; they had arrived in the middle of dinner.

â€œThe sheriffâ€”that would be Mr. Tolliver,â€ he said. â€œI know him. Shall weâ€”â€

Jamie made an abrupt gesture, cutting him short.

â€œWe went there to begin with,â€ he said. They had found the sheriff gone, and no one in the house save a very drunken woman with a face like a discontented bird, collapsed and snoring on the settle with a small Negro baby clutched in her arms.

He had taken the baby and thrust it into Ianâ€™s arms, bidding him grimly to mind it while he sobered the woman enough to talk. He had then dragged her out into the yard and poured buckets of well water over her until she gasped and blinked, then dragged her dripping and stumbling back into the house, where he obliged her to drink water poured over the black, burned dregs of chicory coffee he had found in the pot. She had vomited profusely and disgustingly, but regained some vague sense of language.

â€œAt first, all she could say was that all of the female prisoners were goneâ€”run off or hanged.â€ He said nothing of the fright that had lanced through his belly at that last. He had shaken the woman thoroughly, though, demanding particulars, and eventually, after further applications of water and vile coffee, got them.

â€œA man came, the day before yesterday, and took her away. That was all she knewâ€”or all she remembered. I made her tell me what she could of how he lookedâ€”it wasna Brown, nor yet Neil Forbes.â€

â€œI see.â€ Fergus glanced behind him; his family were all gathered round Ian, pestering and caressing him. Marsali, though, was looking toward the alcove, worry on her face, obviously wanting to come and join the conversation, but detained by Joan, who was tugging on her skirt.

â€œWho would take her, I wonder?â€

â€œJoanie, a chuisle, will ye not leave go? Help FÃ©licitÃ© for a moment, aye?â€

â€œBut, Mamaâ€”â€

â€œNot now. In a moment, aye?â€

â€œI dinna ken,â€ Jamie said, the frustration of helplessness welling up like black bile at the back of his throat. A sudden, more horrible thought struck him. â€œGod, dâ€™ye suppose it might have been Stephen Bonnet?â€

The womanâ€™s slurred description had not sounded like the pirateâ€”but she had been far from certain in it. Could Forbes have learned of his own escape, and determined simply to reverse the roles in the drama he had conceivedâ€”deport Claire forcibly to England, and try to pin the guilt of Malva Christieâ€™s death to Jamieâ€™s coat?

He found it hard to breathe, and had to force air into his chest. If Forbes had given Claire to Bonnet, he would slit the lawyer from wishbone to cock, rip the guts from his belly, and strangle him with them. And the same for the Irishman, once he laid hands upon him.

â€œPapi, Pa-pee . . .â€ Joanâ€™s singsong voice penetrated dimly through the red cloud that filled his head.

â€œWhat, chÃ©rie?â€ Fergus lifted her with the ease of long practice, balancing her fat little bottom on his left arm, to leave his right hand free.

She put her arms round his neck and hissed something into his ear.

â€œOh, did you?â€ he said, plainly abstracted. â€œTrÃ¨s bien. Where did you put it, chÃ©rie?â€

â€œWith the naughty-lady pictures.â€

She pointed at the upper shelf, where several volumes lay, leather-bound but discreetly untitled. Glancing in the direction she indicated, Jamie saw a smudged paper sticking out from between two of the books.

Fergus clicked his tongue in displeasure, and smacked her lightly on the bottom with his good hand.

â€œYou know you are not to climb up there!â€

Jamie reached over and pulled the paper out. And felt all the blood leave his head, at sight of the familiar writing on it.

â€œWhat?â€ Fergus, alarmed at his appearance, set Joanie down. â€œSit, milord! Run, chÃ©rie, get the smelling bottle.â€

Jamie waved a hand, speechless, trying to indicate that he was all right, and succeeded at last in finding his tongue.

â€œSheâ€™s in the Governorâ€™s Palace,â€ he said. â€œChrist be thanked, sheâ€™s safe.â€

Seeing a stool pushed under the shelf, he pulled it out and sat on it, feeling exhaustion pulse through the quivering muscles of thigh and calf, ignoring the confusion of question and explanation, how Joanie had found the note pushed under the doorâ€”anonymous submissions to the newspaper often were delivered in this fashion, and the children knew they were to bring such things to their fatherâ€™s attention. . . .

Fergus read the note, his dark eyes assuming the expression of interested intent that he always had when contemplating the abstraction of something difficult and valuable.

â€œWell, that is good,â€ he said. â€œWe will go and fetch her. But I think first you must eat a little, milord.â€

He wished to refuse, to say that there was not a moment to be lost, that he could eat nothing in any case; his wame was knotted, hurting him.

But Marsali was already hurrying the girls back to the kitchen, calling out things about hot coffee and bread, and Ian following her, Henri-Christian still wrapped lovingly about his ears, Germain yapping eagerly at his heels. And he knew that should it come to a fight, he had nothing left to fight with. Then the succulent sizzle and scent of eggs frying in butter reached him, and he was up and moving toward the back, like iron drawn by a magnet.

Over their hasty meal, various plans were offered and rejected. At length, he reluctantly accepted Fergusâ€™s suggestion that either Fergus or Ian should go openly to the palace, asking to see Claire, saying that he was a kinsman, wishing to assure himself of her welfare.

â€œThey have no reason to deny her presence, after all,â€ Fergus said, shrugging. â€œIf we can see her, so much the better; but even if not, we will learn whether she is still there, and perhaps where she is likely to be within the palace.â€

Fergus clearly wished to undertake the errand, but yielded when Ian pointed out that Fergus was widely known in New Bern, and it might be suspected that he was merely hunting scandal for the newspaper.

â€œFor I am pained to say, milord,â€ Fergus said apologetically, â€œthat the matterâ€”the crimeâ€”is known here already. There are broadsheets . . . the usual nonsense. Lâ€™Oignon was obliged to print something regarding the matter, of course, to keep our countenance, but we did so in a most repressive fashion, mentioning only the bald facts of the matter.â€ His long, mobile mouth compressed briefly, in illustration of the repressive nature of his article, and Jamie smiled faintly.

â€œAye, I see,â€ he said. He pushed back from the table, pleased to feel some strength returned to his limbs, and heartened anew by food, coffee, and the comforting knowledge of Claireâ€™s whereabouts. â€œWell, then, Ian, comb your hair. Ye dinna want the Governor to think ye a savage.â€



JAMIE INSISTED UPON going with Ian, despite the danger of being recognized. His nephew eyed him narrowly.

â€œYeâ€™re no going to do anything foolish, Uncle Jamie?â€

â€œWhen was the last time ye kent me to do anything foolish?â€

Ian gave him an old-fashioned look, held up one hand, and began to fold the fingers down, one by one.

â€œOh, well, let me reckon, then . . . Simms the printer? Tarring Forbes? Roger Mac told me what ye did in Mecklenberg. And then there wasâ€”â€

â€œYe would have let them kill wee Fogarty?â€ Jamie inquired. â€œAnd if weâ€™re mentioning fools, who was it got his arse pricked for wallowing in mortal sin withâ€”â€

â€œWhat I mean is,â€ Ian said severely, â€œyeâ€™re no going to walk into the Governorâ€™s Palace and try to take her by force, no matter what happens. Yeâ€™ll wait quietly wiâ€™ your hat on until I come back, and then weâ€™ll see, aye?â€

Jamie pulled down the brim of his hat, a floppy, weathered felt affair such as a pig farmer might wear, with his hair tucked up beneath it.

â€œWhat makes ye think I wouldnâ€™t?â€ he asked, as much from curiosity as natural contention.

â€œThe look on your face,â€ Ian replied briefly. â€œI want her back as much as you do, Uncle Jamieâ€”well,â€ he amended, with a wry grin, â€œperhaps not quite sae muchâ€”but I mean to have her back, nonetheless. Youâ€â€”he poked his uncle emphatically in the chestâ€”â€œbide your time.â€

And leaving Jamie standing under a heat-stricken elm, he strode purposefully toward the gates of the palace.

Jamie took several deep breaths, trying to maintain a sense of annoyance with Ian as an antidote to the anxiety that wrapped itself round his chest like a snake. As the annoyance had been purely manufactured, it evaporated like steam from a kettle, leaving the anxiety squirming and writhing.

Ian had reached the gate, and was in palaver with the guard who stood there, musket at the ready. Jamie could see the man shaking his head emphatically.

This was nonsense, he thought. The need of her was a physical thing, like the thirst of a sailor becalmed for weeks on the sea. Heâ€™d felt that need before, often, often, in their years apart. But why now? She was safe; he knew where she wasâ€”was it only the exhaustion of the past weeks and days, or perhaps the weakness of creeping age that made his bones ache, as though she had in fact been torn from his body, as God had made Eve from Adamâ€™s rib?

Ian was arguing, making persuasive gestures toward the guard. The sound of wheels on gravel drew his attention from them; a carriage was coming down the drive, a small open conveyance with two people and a driver, drawn by a team of nice dark bays.

The guard had pushed Ian back with the barrel of his musket, gesturing him to keep away while the guard and his fellow opened the gates. The carriage rattled through without stopping, turned into the street, and came past him.

He had never seen Josiah Martin, but thought the plump, self-important-looking gentleman must surely be theâ€” His eye caught the merest glimpse of the woman, and his heart clenched like a fist. Without an instantâ€™s thought, he was pelting after the carriage, as hard as he could run.

In his prime, he could not have outrun a team of horses. Even so, he came within a few feet of the carriage, would have called, but had no breath, no sight, and then his foot struck a misplaced cobble and he fell headlong.

He lay stunned and breathless, vision dark and his lungs afire, hearing only the receding clatter of hooves and carriage wheels, until a strong hand seized his arm and jerked.

â€œWeâ€™ll avoid notice, he says,â€ Ian muttered, bending to get his shoulder under Jamieâ€™s arm. â€œYour hatâ€™s flown off, did ye notice that? Nay, of course not, nor the whole street staring, ye crack-brained gomerel. God, ye weigh as much as a three-year bullock!â€

â€œIan,â€ he said, and paused to gulp for breath.

â€œAye?â€

â€œYe sound like your mother. Stop.â€ Another gulp of air. â€œAnd let go my arm; I can walk.â€

Ian gave a snort that sounded even more like Jenny, but did stop, and did let go. Jamie picked up his fallen hat and limped toward the printshop, Ian following in urgent silence through the staring streets.



SAFELY AWAY FROM the palace, we trotted sedately through the streets of New Bern, provoking only mild interest from the citizenry, some of whom waved, a few of whom called out vaguely hostile things, most of whom simply stared. At the edge of town, the groom turned the team onto the main road, and we bowled pleasantly along, apparently bound for an outing in the countryside, an illusion bolstered by the wicker picnic hamper visible behind us.

Once past the congestion of heavy wagons, cattle, sheep, and the other traffic of commerce, though, the groom whipped up, and we were flying again.

â€œWhere are we going?â€ I shouted over the noise of the team, holding on to my hat to prevent it blowing off. I had thought we were merely providing a diversion, so that no one would notice Mrs. Martinâ€™s quiet removal until she was safely out of the colony. Evidently, though, we were not merely out for a picnic.

â€œBrunswick!â€ the Governor shouted back.

â€œWhere?â€

â€œBrunswick,â€ he repeated. He looked grim, and grimmer still as he cast a last look back toward New Bern. â€œGod damn them,â€ he said, though I was sure he meant this observation only for himself. He turned round then, and settled himself, leaning slightly forward, as though to speed the carriage, and said no more.

THE CRUIZER




I WOKE EVERY MORNING, just before dawn. Worn out from worry and the Governorâ€™s late hours, I slept like the dead, through all the thumps and rattlings and bell-ringings of the watch, shouts from boats nearby, occasional musket-fire from the shore, and the whine of the offshore wind as it passed through the rigging. But in that moment before the light, the silence woke me.

Today? was the single thought in my mind, and I seemed to hang bodiless for a moment, just above my pallet beneath the forecastle. Then I drew breath, heard my heart beating, and felt the gentle heave of the deck beneath me. Would turn my face to the shore, watching, as the light began to touch the waves and reach toward land. We had first gone to Fort Johnston, but had stayed there barely long enough for the Governor to meet with local Loyalists who had assured him how unsafe it was, before retreating further.

We had been aboard His Majestyâ€™s sloop Cruizer for nearly a week, anchored off Brunswick. Lacking any troops save the Marines aboard the sloop, Governor Martin was unable to seize back control of his colony, and was reduced to writing frenzied letters, attempting to keep up some semblance of a government in exile.

Lacking anyone else to fill the office, I remained in my role as ad hoc secretary, though I had moved up from mere copyist to amanuensis, taking down some letters by dictation when Martin grew too tired to write himself. And cut off from land and information alike, I spent every spare moment watching the shore.

Today, a boat was coming, out of the fading dark.

One of the watch hailed it, and an answering â€œhallooâ€ came up, in tones of such agitation that I sat up abruptly, groping for my stays.

Today, there would be news.

The messenger was already in the Governorâ€™s cabin, and one of the Marines barred my wayâ€”but the door was open, and the manâ€™s voice clearly audible.

â€œAsheâ€™s done it, sir, heâ€™s moving against the fort!â€

â€œWell, God damn him for a treasonous dog!â€

There was a sound of footsteps, and the Marine stepped hastily out of the way, just in time to avoid the Governor, who came popping out of his cabin like a jack out of the box, still attired in a billowing nightshirt and minus his wig. He seized the ladder and scampered up it like a monkey, affording me an unwanted view from below of his chubby bare buttocks. The Marine caught my eye and quickly averted his own gaze.

â€œWhat are they doing? Do you see them?â€

â€œNot yet.â€ The messenger, a middle-aged man in the dress of a farmer, had followed the Governor up the ladder; their voices floated down from the rail.

â€œColonel Ashe ordered all the ships in Wilmington Harbor to take on troops yesterday and float them down to Brunswick. They were mustering just outside the town this morning; I heard the roll calls whilst I was doing the morning milkingâ€”nigh onto five hundred men, they must have. When I saw that, sir, I slipped away down to the shore and found a boat. Thought you ought to know, Your Excellence.â€ The manâ€™s voice had lost its agitation now, and taken on a rather self-righteous tone.

â€œOh, yes? And what do you expect me to do about it?â€ The Governor sounded distinctly cranky.

â€œHow should I know?â€ said the messenger, replying in like vein. â€œI ainâ€™t the Governor, now, am I?â€

The Governorâ€™s response to this was drowned out by the striking of the shipâ€™s bell. As it died away, he strode past the companionway, and looking down, saw me below.

â€œOh, Mrs. Fraser. Will you fetch me some tea from the galley?â€

I hadnâ€™t much choice, though I would have preferred to stay and eavesdrop. The galley fire had been banked for the night in its small iron pot, and the cook was still abed. By the time I had poked up the fire, boiled water, brewed a pot of tea, and assembled a tray with teapot, cup, saucer, milk, and toast, butter, biscuits, and jam, the Governorâ€™s informant had gone; I saw his boat heading for the shore, a dark arrowhead against the slowly brightening surface of the sea.

I paused for a moment on deck and rested my tea tray on the rail, looking inland. It was just light now, and Fort Johnston was visible, a blocky log building that stood exposed on top of a low rise, surrounded by a cluster of houses and outbuildings. There was a fair amount of activity around it; men were coming and going like a trail of ants. Nothing that looked like an imminent invasion, though. Either the commander, Captain Collet, had decided to evacuateâ€”or Asheâ€™s men had not yet begun their march from Brunswick.

Had John Ashe received my message? If he had . . . would he have acted? It wouldnâ€™t have been a popular thing to do; I couldnâ€™t blame him if he had decided that he simply couldnâ€™t afford to be seen aiding a man widely suspected of being a Loyalistâ€”let alone one accused of such a hideous crime.

He might have, though. With the Governor marooned at sea, the Council disbanded, and the court system evaporated, there was no effective law in the colony nowâ€”save for the militias. If Ashe chose to storm the Wilmington jail and remove Jamie, he would have faced precious little opposition.

And if he had . . . if Jamie were free, he would be looking for me. And surely he would hear quickly where I was. If John Ashe came to Brunswick and Jamie were free, he would surely come with Asheâ€™s men. I looked toward shore, seeking movement, but saw only a boy driving a cow desultorily along the road to Brunswick. But the shadows of the night were still cold around my feet; it was barely dawn.

I took a deep breath, and noticed the aromatic scent of the tea, mixed with the shoreâ€™s morning breathâ€”the smell of tide flats and piney scrub. I hadnâ€™t drunk tea in months, if not years. Thoughtfully, I poured a cup, and sipped it slowly, watching the shore.



WHEN I ARRIVED IN the surgeonâ€™s cabin, which the Governor had taken for his office, he was dressed, and alone.

â€œMrs. Fraser.â€ He nodded briefly to me, scarcely looking up. â€œI am obliged. Will you write, please?â€

He had been writing himself, already; quills and sand and blotter were scattered about the desk, and the inkwell stood open. I picked out a decent quill and a sheet of paper, and began to write as per his dictation, with a sense of growing curiosity.

The noteâ€”dictated between bites of toastâ€”was to a General Hugh MacDonald, and referred to the Generalâ€™s safe arrival upon the mainland with a Colonel McLeod. Receipt of the Generalâ€™s report was acknowledged, and request made for continuing information. Mention was also made of the Governorâ€™s request for supportâ€”which I knew aboutâ€”and assurances he had received regarding the arrival of that support, which I didnâ€™t.

â€œEnclosure, a letter of creditâ€”no, wait.â€ The Governor darted a look in the direction of the shoreâ€”to no particular avail, as the surgeonâ€™s cabin boasted no portholeâ€”and scowled in concentration. Evidently, it had occurred to him that in light of recent events, a letter of credit issued by the Governorâ€™s office was possibly worth less than one of Mrs. Fergusonâ€™s forgeries.

â€œEnclosure, twenty shillings,â€ he amended with a sigh. â€œIf you will make the fair copy at once, Mrs. Fraser? These, you may do at your leisure.â€ He pushed across an untidy stack of notes, done in his own crabbed hand.

He got up then, groaning as he stretched, and went up, no doubt to peer over the railing at the fort again.

I made the copy, sanded it, and set it aside, wondering who on earth this MacDonald was, and what he was doing? Unless Major MacDonald had undergone a change of name and an extraordinary promotion of late, it couldnâ€™t be he. And from the tone of the Governorâ€™s remarks, it appeared that General MacDonald and his friend McLeod were traveling aloneâ€”and on some particular mission.

I flipped quickly through the waiting stack of notes, but saw nothing else of interest; just the usual administrative trivia. The Governor had left his writing desk on the table, but it was closed. I debated trying to pick the lock and rummage through his private correspondence, but there were too many people about: seamen, Marines, shipâ€™s boys, visitorsâ€”the place was seething.

There was a sense of nervous tension aboard, as well. Iâ€™d noticed many times before how a sense of danger communicates itself among people in a confined setting: hospital emergency room, surgical suite, train car, ship; urgency flashes from one person to the next without speech, like the impulse down a neuronâ€™s axon to the dendrites of another. I didnâ€™t know whether anyone beyond the Governor and myself knew about John Asheâ€™s movements yetâ€”but the Cruizer knew that something was up.

The sense of nervous anticipation was affecting me, too. I was fidgeting, toe tapping absently, fingers moving restlessly up and down the shaft of the quill, unable to concentrate enough to write with it.

I stood up, with no idea what I meant to do; only the fixed notion that I would suffocate with impatience if I stayed below any longer.

On the shelf beside the door to the cabin stood the usual half-tidy clutter of shipboard, jammed behind a rail: a candlestick, extra candles, a tinderbox, a broken pipe, a bottle with a twist of flax stopping it, a bit of wood that someone had tried to carve and made a mess of. And a box.

The Cruizer had no surgeon aboard. And surgeons tended to take their personal implements with them, unless they died. This must be a kit belonging to the ship itself.

I glanced out the door; there were voices nearby, but no one in sight. I hastily flipped open the box, wrinkling my nose at the scent of dried blood and stale tobacco. There wasnâ€™t much there, and what there was was thrown in higgledy-piggledy, rusted, crusted, and of little use. A tin of Blue Pills, so labeled, and a bottle, not labeled, but recognizable, of black draughtâ€”laudanum, that is. A dried-up sponge and a sticky cloth stained with something yellow. And the one thing certain to be in any surgeonâ€™s kit of the timesâ€”blades.

There were footsteps coming down the companionway, and I heard the Governorâ€™s voice, talking to someone. Without pausing to consider the wisdom of my conduct, I grabbed a small jointing knife and thrust it down the front of my stays.

I slammed shut the lid of the box. There was no time to sit down again, though, before the Governor arrived, with another visitor in tow.

My heart was hammering in my throat. I pressed my palms, damp with sweat, against my skirt, and nodded to the new arrival, who was regarding me, open-mouthed, behind the Governor.

â€œMajor MacDonald,â€ I said, hoping that my voice wouldnâ€™t tremble. â€œFancy meeting you here!â€



MACDONALDâ€™S MOUTH snapped shut and he drew himself more firmly upright.

â€œMrs. Fraser,â€ he said, bowing warily. â€œYour servant, mum.â€

â€œYou know her?â€ Governor Martin glanced from MacDonald to me and back, frowning.

â€œWeâ€™ve met,â€ I said, nodding politely. It had occurred to me that it might not profit either of us for the Governor to think there was some connection between usâ€”if indeed there was one.

The same thought had clearly struck MacDonald; his face betrayed nothing beyond faint courtesy, though I could see the thoughts darting to and fro behind his eyes like a swarm of gnats. I was entertaining a similar swarm, myselfâ€”and knowing that my own face was naturally revealing, I cast down my eyes demurely, and murmuring an excuse about refreshment, made off toward the galley.

I threaded my way through clumps of seamen and Marines, mechanically acknowledging their salutes, mind working furiously.

How? How was I going to speak to MacDonald alone? I had to find out what he knew about Jamieâ€”if anything. Would he tell me, if he did know anything? But yes, I thought, he would; soldier he might be, but MacDonald was also a confirmed gossipâ€”and he was plainly dying of curiosity at the sight of me.

The cook, a chubby young free black named Tinsdale, who wore his hair in three stubby braids that stuck out of his head like the horns of a triceratops, was at work in the galley, dreamily toasting bread over the fire.

â€œOh, hullo,â€ he said amiably, seeing me. He waved the toasting fork. â€œWant a bit of toast, Mrs. Fraser? Or is it the hot water, again?â€

â€œLove some toast,â€ I said, seized by inspiration. â€œBut the Governor has company; he wants coffee sent. And if you have a few of those nice almond biscuits to go with it . . .â€

Armed with a loaded coffee tray, I made my way toward the surgeonâ€™s cabin a few minutes later, heart pounding. The door was open for air; evidently it wasnâ€™t a secret meeting.

They were huddled together over the small desk, the Governor frowning at a wad of papers, these clearly having traveled some distance in MacDonaldâ€™s dispatch case, judging from the creases and stains upon them. They appeared to be letters, written in a variety of hands and inks.

â€œOh, coffee,â€ the Governor said, looking up. He seemed vaguely pleased, plainly not recalling that he hadnâ€™t ordered any. â€œSplendid. Thank you, Mrs. Fraser.â€

MacDonald hastily picked up the papers, making room for me to set the tray down on the desk. The Governor had one in his hand; he kept hold of this, and I caught a quick glimpse of it as I bent to place the tray in front of him. It was a list of some sortâ€”names on one side, numbers beside them.

I managed to knock a spoon to the floor, enabling a better look as I stooped for it. H. Bethune, Cookâ€™s Creek, 14. Jno. McManus, Boone, 3. F. Campbell, Campbelton, 24?

I darted a look at MacDonald, who had his eyes fixed on me. I dropped the spoon on the desk, then took a hasty step back, so that I stood directly behind the Governor. I pointed a finger at MacDonald, then in rapid succession clutched my throat, tongue protruding, grabbed my stomach with crossed forearms, then jabbed the finger again at him, then at myself, all the while giving him a monitory stare.

MacDonald viewed this pantomime with subdued fascination, butâ€”with a veiled glance at the Governor, who was stirring his coffee with one hand, frowning at the paper he held in the otherâ€”gave me a tiny nod.

â€œHow many can you be quite sure of?â€ the Governor was saying, as I curtsied and backed out.

â€œOh, at least five hundred men, sir, even now,â€ MacDonald replied confidently. â€œA great many more to come, as word spreads. Ye should see the enthusiasm with which the General has been received so far! I cannot speak for the Germans, of course, but depend upon it, sir, we shall have all the Highlanders of the backcountry, and not a few of the Scotchâ€“Irish, too.â€

â€œGod knows I hope you are right,â€ the Governor said, sounding hopeful, but still dubious. â€œWhere is the General now?â€

I would have liked to hear the answer to thatâ€”and a good many other thingsâ€”but the drum was beating overhead for mess, and thundering feet were already pounding down the decks and companionways. I couldnâ€™t lurk about eavesdropping in plain sight of the mess, so was obliged to go back up top, hoping that MacDonald had indeed got my message.

The captain of the Cruizer was standing by the rail, his first mate beside him, both scanning the shore with their telescopes.

â€œIs anything happening?â€ I could see more activity near the fort, people coming and goingâ€”but the shore road was still empty.

â€œCanâ€™t say, maâ€™am.â€ Captain Follard shook his head, then lowered the telescope and shut it, reluctantly, as though afraid something might happen if he didnâ€™t keep his eyes fixed on the shore. The first mate didnâ€™t move, still squinting fixedly toward the fort on its bluff.

I remained there by his side, staring silently toward the shore. The tide shifted; I had been on the ship long enough to feel it, a barely perceptible pause, the sea taking breath as the invisible moon yielded its pull.

There is a tide in the affairs of men. . . . Surely Shakespeare had stood upon a deck, at least once, and felt that same faint shift, deep in the flesh. A professor had told me once, in medical school, that the Polynesian seafarers dared their vast journeys through the trackless sea because they had learned to sense the currents of the ocean, the shifts of wind and tide, registering these changes with that most delicate of instrumentsâ€”their testicles.

It didnâ€™t take a scrotum to feel the currents that were swirling round us now, I reflected, with a sideways glance at the first mateâ€™s securely fastened white breeches. I could feel them in the pit of my stomach, in the damp of my palms, in the tenseness of the muscles at the back of my neck. The mate had lowered his telescope, but still looked toward the shore, almost absently, his hands resting on the rail.

It occurred to me suddenly that if something drastic were to happen on land, the Cruizer would at once lift sail and head out to sea, carrying the Governor to safetyâ€”and me farther from Jamie. Where on earth might we end up? Charlestown? Boston? Either was as likely. And no one on that seething shore would have any notion where we had gone.

Iâ€™d met displaced persons during the warâ€”my war. Driven or taken from their homes, their families scattered, their cities destroyed, they thronged refugee camps, stood in lines besieging embassies and aid stations, asking, always asking for the names of the vanished, describing the faces of the loved and lost, grasping at any scrap of information that might lead them back to whatever might be left. Or, failing that, preserve for a moment longer what they had once been.

The day was warm, even on the water, and my clothes clung to me with humid damp, but my muscles convulsed and my hands on the rail shook with sudden chill.

I might have seen them all for the last time, not knowing it: Jamie, Bree, Jemmy, Roger, Ian. Thatâ€™s how it happened: I had not even said goodbye to Frank, had had no faintest inkling when he left that last night that I would never see him alive again. What ifâ€”

But no, I thought, steadying myself with a tighter grip on the wooden rail. We would find each other again. We had a place to return to. Home. And if I remained aliveâ€”as I most firmly intended to doâ€”I would go back home.

The mate had shut his telescope and left; I hadnâ€™t noticed his departure, absorbed in morbid thoughts, and was quite startled when Major MacDonald hove to alongside me.

â€œToo bad the Cruizer has nay long-range guns,â€ he said with a nod at the fort. â€œâ€™Twould put a crimp in the plans oâ€™ those wee heathen, eh?â€

â€œWhatever those plans might be,â€ I replied. â€œAnd speaking of plansâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™ve a kind of a griping in the wame,â€ he interrupted blandly. â€œThe Governor suggested that ye might possibly have some sort of medicine to soothe it.â€

â€œDid he indeed?â€ I said. â€œWell, come down to the galley; Iâ€™ll brew you a cup of something that will set you right, I expect.â€



â€œDID YE KEN, he thought ye were a forger?â€ MacDonald, hands wrapped around a mug of tea, jerked his head in the direction of the main cabin. The Governor was nowhere in sight, and the cabinâ€™s door closed.

â€œI did, yes. Does he know better now?â€ I asked with a sense of resignation.

â€œWell, aye.â€ MacDonald looked apologetic. â€œI supposed he knew already, or I wouldna have said. Though if I hadnâ€™t,â€ he added, â€œhe would have kent it sooner or later. The storyâ€™s spread all the way to Edenton by now, and the broadsheets . . .â€

I flapped a hand, dismissing this.

â€œHave you seen Jamie?â€

â€œI have not.â€ He glanced at me, curiosity warring with wariness. â€œIâ€™d heard . . . aye, well, Iâ€™ve heard a great many things, and all different. But the meat of the matter is that yeâ€™ve both been arrested, aye? For the murder of Miss Christie.â€

I nodded briefly. I wondered whether one day I would grow used to that word. The sound of it was still like a punch in the stomach, short and brutal.

â€œNeed I tell you that there is no truth to it?â€ I said bluntly.

â€œNot the slightest need, mum,â€ he assured me, with a fair assumption of confidence. But I sensed the hesitation in him, and saw the sideways glance, curious and somehow avid. Perhaps one day Iâ€™d get used to that, too.

My hands were cold; I wrapped them round my own mug, taking what comfort I could in its heat.

â€œI need to get word to my husband,â€ I said. â€œDo you know where he is?â€

MacDonaldâ€™s pale blue eyes were fixed on my face, his own showing no more now than courteous attention.

â€œNo, mum. But you do, I assume?â€

I gave him a sharp look.

â€œDonâ€™t be coy,â€ I advised him shortly. â€œYou know as well as I do whatâ€™s going on on shoreâ€”probably much better.â€

â€œCoy.â€ His thin lips pursed in brief amusement. â€œI dinna believe anyoneâ€™s called me that before. Aye, I know. And so?â€

â€œI think that he may be in Wilmington. I tried to send word to John Ashe, and asked him to get Jamie out of the gaol in Wilmington, if possibleâ€”if he was thereâ€”and to tell him where I was. But I donâ€™t knowâ€”â€ I waved a hand in frustration toward the shore.

He nodded, native caution at odds with his obvious desire to ask me for the gory details of Malvaâ€™s death.

â€œI shall be going back through Wilmington. Iâ€™ll make such inquiries as may be possible. If I find Mr. Fraserâ€”shall I tell him anything, beyond your present situation?â€

I hesitated, thinking. I had been holding a constant conversation with Jamie, ever since they took him away from me. But none of what I said to him in the wide black nights or the lonely dawns seemed appropriate to confide to MacDonald. And yet . . . I couldnâ€™t forgo the opportunity; God knew when I might have another.

â€œTell him that I love him,â€ I said softly, my eyes on the tabletop. â€œI always will.â€

MacDonald made a small sound that made me look up at him.

â€œEven though heâ€”â€ he began, then stopped himself.

â€œHe didnâ€™t kill her,â€ I said sharply. â€œAnd neither did I. I told you so.â€

â€œOf course not,â€ he said hurriedly. â€œNo one could imagine . . . I only meant . . . but of course, a manâ€™s but a man, and . . . mmphm.â€ He broke off and looked away, the color high in his face.

â€œHe didnâ€™t do that, either,â€ I said through my teeth.

There was a marked silence, during which we avoided each otherâ€™s gaze.

â€œIs General MacDonald a kinsman of yours?â€ I asked abruptly, needing either to change the course of the conversation or to leave.

The Major glanced up, surprisedâ€”and relieved.

â€œAye, a distant cousin. The Governorâ€™s mentioned him?â€

â€œYes,â€ I said. It was the truth, after all; Martin simply hadnâ€™t mentioned the General to me. â€œYouâ€™re, um, assisting him, are you? It sounded as though youâ€™ve been having some success.â€

Relieved to have escaped the social awkwardness of dealing with the question as to whether I were a murderess, and Jamie only a philanderer, or he a murderer and I his scorned and deluded dupe, MacDonald was only too eager to take the offered bait.

â€œGreat success, indeed,â€ he said heartily. â€œIâ€™ve gathered pledges from many of the most prominent men in the colony; they stand ready to do the Governorâ€™s bidding at the slightest word!â€

Jno. McManus, Boone, 3. Prominent men. I happened to know Jonathan McManus, whose gangrenous toes I had removed the winter before. He likely was the most prominent man in Boone, if by that, MacDonald meant that the other twenty inhabitants all knew him for a drunkard and a thief. It was also probably true that he had three men who would go to fight with him if called: his one-legged brother and his two feeble-minded sons. I took a sip of tea to hide my expression. Still, MacDonald had Farquard Campbell on his list; had Farquard really made a formal commitment?

â€œI gather the General is not presently anywhere near Brunswick, though,â€ I said, â€œgiven the, er, present circumstances?â€ If he was, the Governor would be much less nervous than he was.

MacDonald shook his head.

â€œNo. But he is not ready to muster his forces yet; he and McLeod do but discover the readiness of the Highlanders to rise. They will not call muster until the ships come.â€

â€œShips?â€ I blurted. â€œWhat ships?â€

He knew he oughtnâ€™t to speak further, but couldnâ€™t resist. I saw it in his eyes; after all, what danger could there be in telling me?

â€œThe Governor has asked for aid from the Crown in subduing the factionalism and unrest that runs rampant in the colony. And has received assurances that it will be forthcomingâ€”should he be able to raise enough support on the ground to reinforce the government troops who will arrive by ship.

â€œThat is the plan, ye see,â€ he went on, warming to it. â€œWe are notifiedâ€â€”Oh, â€œweâ€ indeed, I thoughtâ€”â€œthat my Lord Cornwallis begins to gather troops in Ireland, who will take ship shortly. They should arrive in the early autumn, and join wiâ€™ the Generalâ€™s militia. Between Cornwallis on the coast and the General cominâ€™ doon frae the hillsâ€”â€ He closed thumb and fingers in a pinching movement. â€œTheyâ€™ll crush the Whiggish whoresons like a pack oâ€™ lice!â€

â€œWill they?â€ I said, endeavoring to sound impressed. Possibly they would; I had no idea, nor did I much care, being in no position to see far beyond the present moment. If I ever got off this frigging boat and out of the shadow of a noose, Iâ€™d worry about it.

The sound of the main cabinâ€™s door opening made me look up. The Governor was closing it behind him. Turning, he saw us, and came to inquire as to MacDonaldâ€™s presumed indisposition.

â€œOh, I am a great deal better,â€ the Major assured him, hand pressed to the waistcoat of his uniform. He belched in illustration. â€œMrs. Fraser is a capital hand at such things. Capital!â€

â€œOh, good,â€ Martin said. He seemed a trifle less harassed than he had earlier. â€œYou will be wanting to go back, then.â€ He signaled to the Marine standing at the foot of the companionway, who knuckled his forehead in acknowledgment and disappeared up the ladder.

â€œThe boat will be ready for you in a few minutesâ€™ time.â€ With a nod at MacDonaldâ€™s half-drunk tea, and a punctilious bow to me, the Governor turned and went into the surgeonâ€™s cabin, where I could see him standing beside the desk, frowning at the heap of crumpled papers.

MacDonald hastily swallowed the rest of his tea, and with a lift of the eyebrows, invited me to accompany him to the upper deck. We were standing on deck, waiting as a local fishing boat made its way out to the Cruizer from shore, when he suddenly laid a hand on my arm.

This startled me; MacDonald was not a casual toucher.

â€œI will do my utmost to discover your husbandâ€™s whereabouts, mum,â€ he said. â€œIt occurs to me, thoughâ€”â€ He hesitated, eyes on my face.

â€œWhat?â€ I said cautiously.

â€œI said I had heard considerable speculation?â€ he said delicately. â€œRegarding . . . erm . . . the unfortunate demise of Miss Christie. Would it not be . . . desirable . . . that I know the truth of the matter, so that I might put any ill-natured rumors firmly to rest, should I encounter them?â€

I was torn between anger and laughter. I should have known that curiosity would be too much for him. But he was right; given the rumors I had heardâ€”and I knew they were but a fraction of those circulatingâ€”the truth was certainly more desirable. On the other hand, I was entirely sure that the telling of the truth would do nothing to quell the rumors.

And still. The urge to be justified was a strong one; I understood those poor wretches who cried their innocence from the gallowsâ€”and I bloody hoped I wasnâ€™t going to be one.

â€œFine,â€ I said crisply. The first mate was back by the rail, keeping an eye on the fort, and within earshot, but I supposed it didnâ€™t matter whether he heard.

â€œThe truth is this: Malva Christie was got with child by someone, but rather than name the real father, insisted that it was my husband. I know this to be false,â€ I added, fixing him with a gimlet stare. He nodded, mouth a little open.

â€œA few days later, I went out to tend my garden and found the littleâ€”Miss Christie lying in my lettuce patch with her throat freshly cut. I thought . . . there was some chance that I might save her unborn child. . . .â€ Despite my assumption of bravado, my voice trembled a little. I stopped, clearing my throat. â€œI couldnâ€™t. The child was born dead.â€

Much better not to say how it was born; that weltering image of severed flesh and dirt-smeared blade was not one I wished the Major to have in mind, if it could be prevented. I had told no oneâ€”not even Jamieâ€”about the faint flicker of life, that tingle that I still held secret in the palms of my hands. To say that the child had been born alive was to arouse immediate suspicion that I had killed it, and I knew as much. Some would think that anyway; Mrs. Martin plainly had.

MacDonaldâ€™s hand was still resting on my arm, his gaze on my face. For once, I blessed the transparency of my countenance; no one watching my face ever doubted what I said.

â€œI see,â€ he said quietly, and gently squeezed my arm.

I took a deep breath, and told him the restâ€”circumstantial details might convince some hearers.

â€œYou know that there were bee gums at the edge of my garden? The murderer kicked two of them over in fleeing; he must have been stung several timesâ€”I was, when I came into the garden. Jamieâ€”Jamie had no stings. It wasnâ€™t him.â€ And under the circumstances, I had not been able to find out which manâ€”or woman? For the first time, it occurred to me that it could have been a womanâ€”had been stung.

At this, he gave a deep â€œhum!â€ of interest. He stood for a moment in contemplation, then shook his head, as though waking from a dream, and let go my arm.

â€œI thank ye, mum, for telling me,â€ he said formally, and bowed to me. â€œBe assured, I will speak in your behalf, whenever the occasion shall arise.â€

â€œI appreciate that, Major.â€ My voice was husky, and I swallowed. I hadnâ€™t realized how much it would hurt to speak of.

The wind stirred around us, and the reefed sails rustled in their ropes overhead. A shout from below announced the presence of the boat that would carry MacDonald back to the shore.

He bowed low over my hand, breath warm on my knuckles. For an instant, my fingers tightened on his; I was surprisingly reluctant to let him go. But let him go I did, and watched him all the way to the shore; a diminishing silhouette against the brightness of the water, back straight with resolution. He didnâ€™t look back.

The mate moved at the rail, sighing, and I glanced at him, then at the fort.

â€œWhat are they doing?â€ I asked. Some of the antlike forms seemed to be dropping lines from the walls to their fellows on the ground; I saw the ropes, fine as spiderwebs from this distance.

â€œI do believe the fortâ€™s commander is preparing to remove the cannon, madam,â€ he said, snapping shut his brass telescope with a click. â€œIf you will excuse me, I need to go inform the captain.â€

GUNPOWDER, TREASON,

AND PLOT




IF THE GOVERNORâ€™S ATTITUDE toward me was altered by the news that I was not in fact a forger but rather a notoriousâ€”if merely accusedâ€”murderess, I had no opportunity to find out. He, like the rest of the officers and half the men aboard, rushed to the rail, and the rest of the day passed in a flurry of observation, speculation, and largely fruitless activity.

The lookout at the masthead called down periodic observationsâ€”men were leaving the fort, carrying things . . . the fortâ€™s weaponry, it looked like.

â€œAre they Colletâ€™s men?â€ the Governor bellowed, shading his eyes to look aloft.

â€œCanâ€™t say, sir,â€ came the unhelpful reply from above.

At last, the Cruizerâ€™s two launches were sent ashore, with orders to collect what information they could. They came back several hours later, with the news that Collet had abandoned the fort, in the face of threats, but had taken pains to remove the guns and powder, lest these fall into rebel hands.

No, sir, they had not spoken with Colonel Collet, who wasâ€”by rumorâ€”on his way upriver with his militia forces. They had sent two men down the road toward Wilmington; it was true that a large force was gathering in the fields outside the town, under Colonels Robert Howe and John Ashe, but no word of what was planned.

â€œNo word of whatâ€™s planned, Godâ€™s ballocks!â€ muttered the Governor, having been ceremoniously informed of this by Captain Follard. â€œThey mean to burn the fort, what else would Ashe be planning, for the love of Jesus?â€

His instincts were quite sound; just before sunset, the scent of smoke came across the water, and we could just make out the antlike scurrying of men, piling heaps of flammable debris around the base of the fort. It was a simple, square building, made of logs. And despite the dampness of the humid air, it would burn, eventually.

It took them no little time to get the fire going, though, with neither powder nor oil to hasten its burning; as night fell, we could clearly see flaming torches, streaming in the breeze as they were carried to and fro, passed from hand to hand, dipping to touch off a pile of kindling, coming back a few minutes later, as the kindling went out.

Around nine oâ€™clock, someone found a few barrels of turpentine, and the blaze took a sudden, lethal hold of the fortâ€™s log walls. Sheets of wavering flame rose pure and brilliant, orange and crimson billows against the night-black sky, and we heard scraps of cheering and snatches of ribald song, borne with the smell of smoke and the tang of turpentine on the offshore breeze.

â€œAt least we neednâ€™t worry about the mosquitoes,â€ I observed, waving a cloud of whitish smoke away from my face.

â€œThank you, Mrs. Fraser,â€ said the Governor. â€œI had not considered that particular positive aspect of the matter.â€ He spoke with some bitterness, his fists resting impotently on the rail.

I took the hint, and said no more. For myself, the leaping flames and the column of smoke that rose wavering toward the stars were cause for celebration. Not for any benefit that the burning of Fort Johnston might be to the rebel causeâ€”but because Jamie might be there, by one of the campfires that had sprung up on the shore below the fort.

And if he was . . . he would come tomorrow.



HE DID. I was awake well before dawnâ€”in fact, I had not sleptâ€”and standing at the rail. There was little of the usual boat traffic this morning, in the wake of the fortâ€™s burning; the bitter smell of wood ash mingled with the marshy smell of the nearby mud flats, and the water was still and oily-looking. It was a gray day, heavily overcast, and a deep bank of haze hung over the water, hiding the shore.

I kept watching, though, and when a small boat came out of the haze, I knew at once that it was Jamie. He was alone.

I watched the long, smooth reach of his arms and the pull of the oars, and felt a sudden deep, calm happiness. I had no notion what might happenâ€”and all the horror and anger connected with Malvaâ€™s death still lurked at the back of my mind, a great dark shape under very thin ice. But he was there. Near enough now to see his face, as he looked back over his shoulder toward the ship.

I lifted a hand to wave; his eyes were already fixed on me. He didnâ€™t stop rowing, but turned round and came on. I stood clinging to the rail, waiting.

The rowboat passed out of sight for a moment, under the lee of the Cruizer, and I heard the watch hail him, the deep half-audible answer, and felt something that had been knotted inside me for a long time let go at the sound of his voice.

I stood rooted, though, not able to move. Then there were footsteps on deck, and a murmur of voicesâ€”someone going to fetch the Governorâ€”and I turned blindly, into Jamieâ€™s arms.

â€œKnew youâ€™d come,â€ I whispered into the linen of his shirt. He reeked of fire: smoke and pinesap and scorched cloth, and the bitter tang of turpentine. Reeked of stale sweat and horses, the weariness of a man who has not slept, who has labored all night, the faint yeasty smell of long hunger.

He held me close, ribs and breath and warmth and muscle, then put me away from him a little and looked down into my face. He had been smiling since I saw him. It lit his eyes, and without a word, he pulled the cap off my head and threw it over the rail. He ran his hands through my hair, fluffing it out into abandon, then cupped my head in his hands and kissed me, fingers digging into my scalp. He had a three-day beard, which rasped my skin like sandpaper, and his mouth was home and safety.

Somewhere behind him, one of the Marines coughed, and said loudly, â€œYou wished to see the Governor, I believe, sir?â€

He let go, slowly, and turned.

â€œI do indeed,â€ he said, and put out a hand to me. â€œSassenach?â€

I took it, and followed the Marine, heading for the companionway. I glanced back over the rail, to see my cap bobbing in the swell, puffed with air and tranquil as a jellyfish.

The momentary illusion of peace vanished directly, though, once we were below.

The Governor had been up most of the night, as well, and didnâ€™t look much better than Jamie, though he was not, of course, besmeared with soot. He was, however, unshaven, bloodshot, and in no mood to be trifled with.

â€œMr. Fraser,â€ he said with a short nod. â€œYou are James Fraser, I collect? And you dwell in the mountain backcountry?â€

â€œI am the Fraser, of Fraserâ€™s Ridge,â€ Jamie said courteously. â€œAnd I have come for my wife.â€

â€œOh, have you.â€ The Governor gave him a sour look and sat down, gesturing indifferently at a stool. â€œI regret to inform you, sir, that your wife is a prisoner of the Crown. Though perhaps you were aware of this?â€

Jamie ignored this bit of sarcasm and took the proffered seat.

â€œIn fact, she is not,â€ he said. â€œIt is true, is it not, that you have declared martial law upon the colony of North Carolina?â€

â€œIt is,â€ Martin said shortly. This was rather a sore point, since while he had declared martial law, he was in no position actually to enforce it, but was obliged to float impotently offshore, fuming, until and unless England chose to send him reinforcements.

â€œThen in fact, all customary legal usage is suspended,â€ Jamie pointed out. â€œYou alone have control over the custody and disposition of any prisonersâ€”and my wife has in fact been in your custody for some little time. Ye therefore have also the power to release her.â€

â€œHm,â€ said the Governor. Plainly he hadnâ€™t thought of that, and wasnâ€™t sure of its ramifications. At the same time, the notion that he was in control of anything at all at the moment was likely soothing to his inflamed spirits.

â€œShe has not been committed for trial, and in fact, there has been no evidence whatever adduced against her,â€ Jamie said firmly.

I found myself uttering a silent prayer of thanks that I had told MacDonald the gory details after his visit with the Governorâ€”it might not be what a modern court called evidence, but being found with a knife in my hand and two warm, bloody corpses was very damned circumstantial.

â€œShe is accused, but there is no merit to the charge. Surely, having had her acquaintance for even so short a time as you have, ye will have drawn your own conclusions as to her character?â€ Not waiting for an answer to this, he pressed on.

â€œWhen accusation was made, we did not resist the attempt to bring my wifeâ€”or myself, for I also have been accused in the matterâ€”to trial. What better indication is there that we should hold such conviction of her innocence as to wish for a speedy trial to establish it?â€

The Governor had narrowed his eyes, and appeared to be thinking intently.

â€œYour arguments are not entirely lacking in virtue, sir,â€ he said at last, with formal courtesy. â€œHowever, I understand that the crime of which your wife stands accused was a most heinous one. For me to release her must necessarily cause public outcryâ€”and I have had rather enough of public unrest,â€ he added, with a bleak look at the scorched cuffs of Jamieâ€™s coat.

Jamie took a deep breath and had another go.

â€œI quite understand Your Excellencyâ€™s reservations,â€ he said. â€œPerhaps some . . . surety might be offered, which would overcome them?â€

Martin sat bolt upright in his chair, receding jaw thrust out.

â€œWhat do you suggest, sir? Have you the impertinence, theâ€”theâ€”unspeakable bloody face to try to bribe me?â€ He slapped both hands down on the desk and glared from Jamie to me and back. â€œGod damn it, I should hang the two of you, out of hand!â€

â€œVery nice, Mr. Ohnat,â€ I muttered to Jamie under my breath. â€œAt least weâ€™re already married.â€

â€œOh, ah,â€ he replied, giving me a brief glance of incomprehension before returning his attention to the Governor, who was muttering â€œSwing them from the bloody yardarm . . . the infernal cheek of it, the creatures!â€

â€œI had no such intent, sir.â€ Jamie kept his voice level, his eyes direct. â€œWhat I offer is a bond, against my wifeâ€™s appearance in court to answer the charge against her. When she does so appear, it would be returned to me.â€

Before the Governor could respond to this, he reached into his pocket and withdrew something small and dark, which he set on the desk. The black diamond.

The sight of it stopped Martin in mid-sentence. He blinked, once, his long-nosed face going almost comically blank. He rubbed a finger slowly across his upper lip, considering.

Having seen a great deal of the Governorâ€™s private correspondence and accounts by now, I was well aware that he had few private means, and was obliged to live far beyond his modest income in order to maintain the appearances necessary for a Royal Governor.

The Governor in turn was well aware that in the current state of unrest, there was little chance of my being brought to trial in any sort of timely manner. It could be monthsâ€”and possibly yearsâ€”before the court system was restored to anything like routine function. And for however long it took, he would have the diamond. He couldnâ€™t in honor simply sell the thingâ€”but could most assuredly borrow a substantial sum against it, in the reasonable expectation that he might redeem it later.

I saw his eyes flicker toward the sooty marks on Jamieâ€™s coat, narrowing in speculation. There was also a good possibility of Jamieâ€™s being killed or arrested for treasonâ€”and I saw the impulse to do just that pop momentarily into his mindâ€”which would leave the diamond perhaps in legal limbo, but certainly in Martinâ€™s possession. I had to force myself to keep on breathing.

But he wasnâ€™t stupid, Martinâ€”nor was he venal. With a small sigh, he pushed the stone back toward Jamie.

â€œNo, sir,â€ he said, though his voice had now lost its earlier outrage. â€œI will not accept this as bond for your wife. But the notion of surety . . .â€ His gaze went to the stack of papers on his desk, and returned to Jamie.

â€œI will make you a proposition, sir,â€ he said abruptly. â€œI have an action in train, an operation by which I hope to raise a considerable body of the Scottish Highlanders, who will march from the backcountry to the coast, there to meet with troops sent from England, and in the process, to subdue the countryside on behalf of the King.â€

He paused for breath, eyeing Jamie closely to assess the effect of his speech. I was standing close behind Jamie, and couldnâ€™t see his face, but didnâ€™t need to. Bree, joking, called it his â€œbrag faceâ€; no one looking at him would ever know whether he held four aces, a full house, or a pair of threes. I was betting on the pair of threes, myselfâ€”but Martin didnâ€™t know him nearly as well as I did.

â€œGeneral Hugh MacDonald and a Colonel Donald McLeod came into the colony some time ago, and have been traversing the countryside, rallying supportâ€”which they have gained in gratifying numbers, I am pleased to say.â€ His fingers drummed briefly on the letters, then stopped abruptly as he leaned forward.

â€œWhat I propose, then, sir, is this: you will return to the backcountry, and gather such men as you can. You will then report to General MacDonald and commit your troops to his campaign. When I receive word from MacDonald that you have arrivedâ€”with, let us say, two hundred menâ€”then, sir, I will release your wife to you.â€

My pulse was beating fast, and so was Majorâ€™s; I could see it throbbing in his neck. Definitely a pair of threes. Obviously, MacDonald hadnâ€™t had time to tell the Governorâ€”or hadnâ€™t knownâ€”just how widespread and acrimonious the response had been to Malva Christieâ€™s death. There were still men on the Ridge who would follow Jamie, I was sureâ€”but many more who would not, or who would, but only if he repudiated me.

I was trying to think logically about the situation, as a means of distracting myself from the crushing disappointment of realizing that the Governor was not going to let me go. Jamie must go without me, leave me here. For an overwhelming instant, I thought I could not bear it; I would run mad, scream and leap across the desk to claw Josiah Martinâ€™s eyes out.

He glanced up, caught a glimpse of my face, and started back, half-rising from his chair.

Jamie put back a hand and gripped my forearm, hard.

â€œBe still, a nighean,â€ he said softly.

I had been holding my breath without realizing it. Now I let it out in a gasp, and made myself breathe slowly.

Just as slowly, the Governorâ€”a wary gaze still fixed on meâ€”lowered himself back into his seat. Clearly, the accusation against me had just become a lot more likely, in his mind. Fine, I thought fiercely, to keep from crying. See how easily you sleep, with me never more than a few feet away from you.

Jamie drew a long, deep breath, and his shoulders squared beneath his tattered coat.

â€œYou will give me leave, sir, to consider your proposal,â€ he said formally, and letting go of my arm, rose to his feet.

â€œDo not despair, mo chridhe,â€ he said to me in Gaelic. â€œI will see you when the morning comes.â€

He lifted my hand to his lips and kissed it, then, with the barest of nods to the Governor, strode out, without looking back.

There was an instantâ€™s silence in the cabin, and I heard his feet going away, climbing the ladder of the companionway. I didnâ€™t pause to consider, but reached down into my stays and withdrew the small knife I had taken from the surgeonâ€™s kit.

I jabbed it down with all my strength, so that it stuck in the wood of the desk and stood there, quivering before the Governorâ€™s astonished eyes.

â€œYou fucking bastard,â€ I said evenly, and left.

FOR THE SAKE OF

ONE WHO IS




I WAS WAITING AT THE RAIL again before dawn the next day. The smell of ashes was strong and acrid on the wind, but the smoke had gone. An early-morning haze still shrouded the shore, though, and I felt a small thrill of dÃ©jÃ  vu, mingled with hope, as I saw the small boat come out of the mist, pulling slowly toward the ship.

As it grew closer, though, my hands tightened on the rail. It wasnâ€™t Jamie. For a few moments, I tried to convince myself that it was, that he had merely changed his coatâ€”but with each stroke of the oars, it became more certain. I closed my eyes, stinging with tears, all the while telling myself that it was absurd to be so upset; it meant nothing.

Jamie would be here; heâ€™d said so. The fact that someone else was coming early to the ship had nothing to do with him or me.

It did, though. Opening my eyes and wiping them on my wrist, I looked again at the rowboat, and felt a start of disbelief. It couldnâ€™t be. It was, though. He looked up at the watchâ€™s hail, and saw me at the rail. Our eyes met for an instant, then he bowed his head, reaching to the oars. Tom Christie.

The Governor was not amused at being roused from his bed at dawn for the third day running; I could hear him below, ordering one of the Marines to tell the fellow, whoever he was, to wait to a more reasonable hourâ€”this followed by a peremptory slam of the cabin door.

I was not amused, either, and in no mood to wait. The Marine at the head of the companionway refused to allow me below, though. Heart pounding, then, I turned and made my way to the stern, where they had put Christie to wait the Governorâ€™s pleasure.

The Marine there hesitated, but after all, there were no orders to prevent me speaking with visitors; he let me pass.

â€œMr. Christie.â€ He was standing at the rail, staring back at the coast, but turned at my words.

â€œMrs. Fraser.â€ He was very pale; his grizzled beard stood out nearly black. He had trimmed it, though, and his hair, as well. While he still looked like a lightning-blasted tree, there was life in his eyes once more when he looked at me.

â€œMy husbandâ€”â€ I began, but he cut me off.

â€œHe is well. He awaits you on the shore; you will see him presently.â€

â€œOh?â€ The boil of fear and fury inside me reduced itself slightly, as though someone had turned down the flame, but a sense of impatience was still steaming. â€œWell, what in bloody hell is going on, will you tell me that?â€

He looked at me for a long moment in silence, then licked his lips briefly, and turned to look over the rail at the smooth gray swell. He glanced back at me and drew a deep breath, obviously bracing himself for something.

â€œI have come to confess to the murder of my daughter.â€

I simply stared at him, unable to make sense of his words. Then I assembled them into a sentence, read it from the tablet of my mind, and finally grasped it.

â€œNo, you havenâ€™t,â€ I said.

The faintest shadow of a smile seemed to stir in his beard, though it vanished almost before I had seen it.

â€œYou remain contrary, I see,â€ he said dryly.

â€œNever mind what I remain,â€ I said, rather rudely. â€œAre you insane? Or is this Jamieâ€™s latest plan? Because if soâ€”â€

He stopped me with a hand on my wrist; I started at the touch, not expecting it.

â€œIt is the truth,â€ he said very softly. â€œAnd I will swear to it by the Holy Scriptures.â€

I stood looking at him, not moving. He looked back, directly, and I realized suddenly how seldom he had ever met my eyes; all through our acquaintance, he had glanced away, avoided my gaze, as though he sought to escape any real acknowledgment of me, even when obliged to speak to me.

Now that was gone, and the look in his eyes was nothing I had ever seen before. The lines of pain and suffering cut deep around them, and the lids were heavy with sorrowâ€”but the eyes themselves were deep and calm as the sea beneath us. That sense he had carried through our nightmare journey south, that atmosphere of mute horror, numb pain, had left him, replaced by resolve and something elseâ€”something that burned, far down in his depths.

â€œWhy?â€ I said at last, and he let go his grip on my wrist, stepping back a pace.

â€œDâ€™ye remember onceâ€â€”from the reminiscent tone of his voice, it might have been decades beforeâ€”â€œye asked me, did I think ye a witch?â€

â€œI remember,â€ I replied guardedly. â€œYou saidâ€”â€ Now I remembered that conversation, all right, and something small and icy fluttered at the base of my spine. â€œYou said that you believed in witches, all rightâ€”but you didnâ€™t think I was one.â€

He nodded, dark gray eyes fixed on me. I wondered whether he was about to revise that opinion, but apparently not.

â€œI believe in witches,â€ he said with complete matter-of-fact seriousness. â€œFor Iâ€™ve kent them. The girl was one, as was her mother before her.â€ The icy flutter grew stronger.

â€œThe girl,â€ I said. â€œYou mean your daughter? Malva?â€

He shook his head a little, and his eyes took on a darker hue. â€œNo daughter of mine,â€ he said.

â€œNotâ€”not yours? Butâ€”her eyes. She had your eyes.â€ I heard myself say it, and could have bitten my tongue. He only smiled, though, grimly.

â€œAnd my brotherâ€™s.â€ He turned to the rail, put his hands on it, and looked across the stretch of sea, toward land. â€œEdgar was his name. When the Rising came, and I declared for the Stuarts, he would have none of it, saying â€™twas folly. He begged me not to go.â€ He shook his head slowly, seeing something in memory, that I knew was not the wooded shore.

â€œI thoughtâ€”well, it doesna matter what I thought, but I went. And asked him, would he mind my wife, and the wee lad.â€ He drew a deep breath, let it slowly out. â€œAnd he did.â€

â€œI see,â€ I said very quietly. He turned his head sharply at the tone of my voice, gray eyes piercing.

â€œIt was not his fault! Mona was a witchâ€”an enchantress.â€ His lips compressed at the expression on my face. â€œYe donâ€™t believe me, I see. It is the truth; more than once, I caught her at itâ€”working her charms, observing timesâ€”I came once to the roof oâ€™ the house at midnight, searching for her. I saw her there, stark naked and staring at the stars, standing in the center of a pentacle sheâ€™d drawn wiâ€™ the blood of a strangled dove, and her hair flying loose, mad in the wind.â€

â€œHer hair,â€ I said, looking for some thread to grasp in this, and suddenly realizing. â€œShe had hair like mine, didnâ€™t she?â€

He nodded, looking away, and I saw his throat move as he swallowed.

â€œShe was . . . what she was,â€ he said softly. â€œI tried to save herâ€”by prayer, by love. I could not.â€

â€œWhat happened to her?â€ I asked, keeping my voice as low as his. With the wind as it was, there was little chance of our being overheard here, but this was not the sort of thing I thought anyone should hear.

He sighed, and swallowed again.

â€œShe was hangit,â€ he said, sounding almost matter-of-fact about it. â€œFor the murder of my brother.â€

This, it seemed, had happened while Tom was imprisoned at Ardsmuir; she had sent him word, before her execution, telling him of Malvaâ€™s birth, and that she was confiding care of the children to Edgarâ€™s wife.

â€œI suppose she thought that funny,â€ he said, sounding abstracted. â€œSheâ€™d the oddest sense of humor, Mona had.â€

I felt cold, beyond the chill of the early-morning breeze, and hugged my elbows.

â€œBut you got them backâ€”Allan and Malva.â€

He nodded; he had been transported, but had the good fortune to have his indenture bought by a kind and wealthy man, who had given him the money for the childrenâ€™s passage to the Colonies. But then both his employer and the wife he had taken here had died in an epidemic of the yellow fever, and casting about for some new opportunity, he had heard of Jamie Fraserâ€™s settling in North Carolina and that he would help those men he had known in Ardsmuir to land of their own.

â€œI would to God I had cut my own throat before I came,â€ he said, turning back abruptly to me. â€œBelieve me in that.â€

He seemed entirely sincere. I didnâ€™t know what to say in response, but he seemed to require none, and went on.

â€œThe girl . . . she was nay more than five years old when I first saw her, but already she had itâ€”the same slyness, the charmâ€”the same darkness of soul.â€

He had tried to the best of his ability to save Malva, as wellâ€”to beat the wickedness out of her, to constrain the streak of wildness, above all, to keep her from working her wiles upon men.

â€œHer mither had that, too.â€ His lips tightened at the thought. â€œAny man. It was the curse of Lilith that they had, the both of them.â€

I felt a hollowness in the pit of my stomach, as he came back now to the matter of Malva.

â€œBut she was with child . . .â€ I said.

His face paled further, but his voice was firm.

â€œAye, she was. I do not think it wrong to prevent yet another witch from entering the world.â€

Seeing my face, he went on before I could interrupt.

â€œYe ken she tried to kill ye? You and me, both.â€

â€œWhat do you mean? Tried to kill me, how?â€

â€œWhen ye told her about the invisible things, theâ€”the germs. She took great interest in that. She told me, when I caught her wiâ€™ the bones.â€

â€œWhat bones?â€ I asked, a sliver of ice running down my back.

â€œThe bones she took from Ephraimâ€™s grave, to work her charms upon your husband. She didna use them all, and I found them in her workbasket later. I beat her, badly, and she told me then.â€

Accustomed to wander alone in the woods in search of food plants and herbs, she had been doing so during the height of the dysentery epidemic. And in her wanderings, had come upon the isolated cabin of the sin-eater, that strange, damaged man. She had found him near death, burning with fever and sunk in coma, and while she stood there undecided whether to run for help, or only run, he had in fact died.

Whereupon, seized by inspirationâ€”and bearing my careful teachings in mindâ€”she had taken mucus and blood from the body and put it into a little bottle with a bit of broth from the kettle on the hearth, nurturing it inside her stays with the warmth of her own body.

And had slipped a few drops of this deadly infusion into my food, and that of her father, in the hope that if we fell sick, our deaths would be seen as no more than a part of the sickness that plagued the Ridge.

My lips felt stiff and bloodless.

â€œYouâ€™re sure of this?â€ I whispered. He nodded, making no effort to convince me, and that alone gave me conviction that he spoke the truth.

â€œShe wantedâ€”Jamie?â€ I asked.

He closed his eyes for a moment; the sun was coming up, and while the brilliance of it was behind us, the gleam off the water was bright as silver plate.

â€œShe . . . wanted,â€ he said at last. â€œShe lusted. Lusted for wealth, for position, for what she saw as freedom, not seeing it as licenseâ€”never seeing!â€ He spoke with sudden violence, and I thought it was not Malva alone who had never seen things as he did.

But she had wanted Jamie, whether for himself or only for his property. And when her love charm failed, and the epidemic of sickness came, had taken a more direct way toward what she wanted. I could not yet find a way to grasp thatâ€”and yet I knew it was true.

And then, finding herself inconveniently with child, she had come up with a new scheme.

â€œDo you know who the father really was?â€ I asked, my throat tightening againâ€”I thought it always wouldâ€”at the memory of the sunlit garden and the two neat, small bodies, ruined and wasted. Such a waste.

He shook his head, but would not look at me, and I knew that he had some idea, at least. He would not tell me, though, and I supposed it didnâ€™t matter just now. And the Governor would be up soon, ready to receive him.

He, too, heard the stirrings down below, and took a deep breath.

â€œI could not let her destroy so many lives; could not let her go on. For she was a witch, make no mistake; that she failed to kill either you or me was no more than luck. She would have killed someone, before she finished. Perhaps you, if your husband clung to you. Perhaps him, in the hope of inheriting his property for the child.â€ He took a ragged, painful breath.

â€œShe was not born of my loins, and yetâ€”she was my daughter, my blood. I could not . . . could not allow . . . I was responsible.â€ He stopped, unable to finish. In this, I thought, he told the truth. And yet . . .

â€œThomas,â€ I said firmly, â€œthis is twaddle, and you know it.â€

He looked at me, surprised, and I saw that tears stood in his eyes. He blinked them back and answered fiercely.

â€œSay you so? You know nothing, nothing!â€

He saw me flinch, and looked down. Then, awkwardly, he reached out and took my hand. I felt the scars of the surgery I had done, the flexible strength of his gripping fingers.

â€œI have waited all my life, in a search . . .â€ He waved his free hand vaguely, then closed his fingers, as though grasping the thought, and continued more surely, â€œNo. In hope. In hope of a thing I could not name, but that I knew must exist.â€

His eyes searched my face, intent, as though he memorized my features. I raised a hand, uncomfortable under this scrutiny, intending, I suppose, to tidy my mad hairâ€”but he caught my hand and held it, surprising me.

â€œLeave it,â€ he said.

Standing with both hands in his, I had no choice.

â€œThomas,â€ I said, uncertain. â€œMr. Christie . . .â€

â€œI became convinced that it was God I sought. Perhaps it was. But God is not flesh and blood, and the love of God alone could not sustain me.

â€œI have written down my confession.â€ He let go, and poked a hand into his pocket, fumbling a little, and pulled out a folded paper, which he clutched in his short, solid fingers.

â€œI have sworn here that it was I who killed my daughter, for the shame she had brought upon me by her wantonness.â€ He spoke firmly enough, but I could see the working of his throat above the wilted stock.

â€œYou didnâ€™t,â€ I said positively. â€œI know you didnâ€™t.â€

He blinked, gazing at me.

â€œNo,â€ he said, quite matter-of-fact. â€œBut perhaps I should have.

â€œI have written a copy of this confession,â€ he said, tucking the document back into his coat, â€œand have left it with the newspaper in New Bern. They will publish it. The Governor will accept itâ€”how can he not?â€”and you will go free.â€

Those last four words struck me dumb. He was still gripping my right hand; his thumb stroked gently over my knuckles. I wanted to pull away, but forced myself to keep still, compelled by the look in his eyes, clear gray and naked now, without disguise.

â€œI have yearned always,â€ he said softly, â€œfor love given and returned; have spent my life in the attempt to give my love to those who were not worthy of it. Allow me this: to give my life for the sake of one who is.â€

I felt as though someone had knocked the wind from me. I hadnâ€™t any breath, but struggled to form words.

â€œMr. Chrâ€”Tom,â€ I said. â€œYou mustnâ€™t. Your life hasâ€”has value. You canâ€™t throw it away like this!â€

He nodded, patient.

â€œI know that. If it did not, this would not matter.â€

Feet were coming up the companionway, and I heard the Governorâ€™s voice below, in cheerful conversation with the Captain of Marines.

â€œThomas! Donâ€™t do this!â€

He only looked at me, and smiledâ€”had I ever seen him smile?â€”but did not speak. He raised my hand and bent over it; I felt the prickle of his beard and the warmth of his breath, the softness of his lips.

â€œI am your servant, madam,â€ he said very softly. He squeezed my hand and released it, then turned and glanced toward the shore. A small boat was coming, dark against the glitter of the silver sea. â€œYour husband is coming for you. Adieu, Mrs. Fraser.â€

He turned and walked away, back steady in spite of the swell that rose and fell beneath us.





PART ELEVEN




In the Day of Vengeance

TO KEEP A GHOST AT BAY




JAMIE GROANED, STRETCHED, and sat down heavily on the bed.

â€œI feel as though someoneâ€™s stepped on my cock.â€

â€œOh?â€ I opened one eye to look at him. â€œWho?â€

He gave me a bloodshot look.

â€œI dinna ken, but it feels as though it was someone heavy.â€

â€œLie down,â€ I said, yawning. â€œWe havenâ€™t got to leave right away; you can rest a bit more.â€

He shook his head.

â€œNay, I want to be home. Weâ€™ve been gone too long as it is.â€ Nonetheless, he didnâ€™t get up and finish dressing, but continued to sit on the swaybacked inn bed in his shirt, big hands hanging idle between his thighs.

He looked tired to death, in spite of just having risen, and no wonder. I didnâ€™t think he could have slept at all for several days, what with his search for me, the burning of Fort Johnston, and the events attending my release from the Cruizer. Remembering, I felt a pall settle over my own spirits, in spite of the joy in which I had wakened, realizing that I was free, on land, and with Jamie.

â€œLie down,â€ I repeated. I rolled toward him, and put a hand on his back. â€œItâ€™s barely dawn. At least wait for breakfast; you canâ€™t travel without rest or food.â€

He glanced at the window, still shuttered; the cracks had begun to pale with the growing light, but I was right; there was no sound below of fires being stoked or pots banged in preparation. Capitulating suddenly, he collapsed slowly sideways, unable to repress a sigh as his head settled back on the pillow.

He didnâ€™t protest when I flung the ratty quilt over him, nor yet when I curved my body to fit round him, wrapping an arm about his waist and laying my cheek against his back. He still smelled of smoke, though both of us had washed hastily the night before, before falling into bed and a dearly bought oblivion.

I could feel how tired he was. My own joints still ached with fatigueâ€”and from the lumps in the flattened, wool-stuffed mattress. Ian had been waiting with horses when we came ashore, and we had ridden as far as we could before darkness fell, finally fetching up at a ramshackle inn in the middle of nowhere, a crude roadside accommodation for wagoneers on their way to the coast.

â€œMalcolm,â€ heâ€™d said, with the slightest of hesitations, when the innkeeper had asked his name. â€œAlexander Malcolm.â€

â€œAnd Murray,â€ Ian had said, yawning and scratching his ribs. â€œJohn Murray.â€

The innkeeper had nodded, not particularly caring. There was no reason why he should associate three nondescript, bedraggled travelers with a notorious case of murderâ€”and yet I had felt panic well up under my diaphragm when he glanced at me.

I had sensed Jamieâ€™s hesitation in giving the name, his distaste for reassuming one of the many aliases he had once lived under. More than most men, he valued his nameâ€”I only hoped that given time, it would once more have value.

Roger might help. He would be a full-fledged minister by now, I thought, smiling at the thought. He had a true gift for soothing the divisions among the inhabitants of the Ridge, easing acrimonyâ€”and having the additional authority of being an ordained minister, his influence would be increased.

It would be good to have him back. And to see Bree and Jemmy againâ€”I had a momentâ€™s longing for them, though we would see them soon; we meant to go through Cross Creek and collect them on the way. But of course, neither Bree nor Roger had any notion what had happened in the last three weeksâ€”nor what life might now be like, in the wake of it.

The birds were in full voice in the trees outside; after the constant screeching of gulls and terns that formed the background of life on the Cruizer, the sound of them was tender, a homely conversation that made me long suddenly for the Ridge. I understood Jamieâ€™s strong urge to be homeâ€”even knowing that what we would find there was not the same life we had left. The Christies would be gone, for one thing.

I hadnâ€™t had the chance to ask Jamie about the circumstances of my rescue; I had finally been put ashore just before sunset, and we had ridden off at once, Jamie wanting to put as much distance as possible between me and Governor Martinâ€”and, perhaps, Tom Christie.

â€œJamie,â€ I said softly, my breath warm in the folds of his shirt. â€œDid you make him do it? Tom?â€

â€œNo.â€ His voice was soft, too. â€œHe came to Fergusâ€™s printshop, the day after ye left the palace. Heâ€™d heard that the gaol had burnedâ€”â€

I sat up in bed, shocked.

â€œWhat? Sheriff Tolliverâ€™s house? No one told me that!â€

He rolled onto his back, looking up at me.

â€œI dinna suppose anyone yeâ€™ve spoken to in the last week or two would know,â€ he said mildly. â€œNo one was killed, Sassenachâ€”I asked.â€

â€œYouâ€™re sure of it?â€ I asked with uneasy thoughts of Sadie Ferguson. â€œHow did it happen? A mob?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, yawning. â€œFrom what I hear, Mrs. Tolliver got stinking drunk, stoked her laundry fire too high, then lay down in the shade and fell asleep. The wood collapsed, the embers set fire to the grass, it spread to the house, and . . .â€ He flipped a hand in dismissal. â€œThe neighbor smelt smoke, though, and rushed over in time to drag Mrs. Tolliver and the bairn safe away. He said there was no one else in the place.â€

â€œOh. Well . . .â€ I let him persuade me to lie down again, my head resting in the hollow of his shoulder. I couldnâ€™t feel strange with him, not after spending the night pressed close against him in the narrow bed, each of us aware of the otherâ€™s every small movement. Still, I was very conscious of him.

And he of me; his arm was round me, his fingers unconsciously exploring the length of my back, lightly reading the shapes of me like braille as he talked.

â€œSo, then, Tom. He kent about Lâ€™Onion, of course, and so went there, when he found yeâ€™d disappeared from the gaol. By then, of course, yeâ€™d gone from the palace, as wellâ€”it had taken him some time to part company wiâ€™ Richard Brown, without rousing their suspicions.

â€œBut he found us there, and he told me what he meant to do.â€ His fingers stroked the back of my neck, and I felt the tightness there begin to relax. â€œI told him to bide; I should have a go at getting ye back on my ownâ€”but if I could not . . .â€

â€œSo you know he didnâ€™t do it.â€ I spoke with certainty. â€œDid he tell you he had?â€

â€œHe only said that he had kept silent while there was any chance of ye being tried and acquittedâ€”but that had ye ever seemed in urgent danger, then heâ€™d meant to speak up at once; thatâ€™s why he insisted upon coming with us. I, ah, didna wish to ask him questions,â€ he said delicately.

â€œBut he didnâ€™t do it.â€ I prodded, insistent. â€œJamie, you know he didnâ€™t!â€

I felt the rise of his chest under my cheek as he breathed.

â€œI know,â€ he said softly.

We were silent for a bit. There was a sudden, muffled rapping outside, and I jerkedâ€”but it was only a woodpecker, hunting insects in the wormy timbers of the inn.

â€œWill they hang him, do you think?â€ I asked at last, staring up at the splintered beams above.

â€œI expect they will, aye.â€ His fingers had resumed their half-unconscious motion, smoothing strands of my hair behind my ear. I lay still, listening to the slow thump of his heart, not wanting to ask what came next. But I had to.

â€œJamieâ€”tell me that he didnâ€™t do itâ€”that he didnâ€™t make that confessionâ€”for me. Please.â€ I didnâ€™t think I could bear that, not on top of everything else.

His fingers stilled, just touching my ear.

â€œHe loves you. Ye ken that, aye?â€ He spoke very quietly; I heard the reverberation of the words in his chest, as much as the words themselves.

â€œHe said he did.â€ I felt a tightness in the throat, recalling that very direct gray look. Tom Christie was a man who said what he meant, and meant what he saidâ€”a man like Jamie, in that regard at least.

Jamie was quiet for what seemed a long time. Then he sighed, and turned his head so his cheek rested against my hair; I heard the faint rasp of his whiskers.

â€œSassenachâ€”I would have done the same, and counted my life well lost, if it saved ye. If he feels the same, then yeâ€™ve done nay wrong to him, to take your life from his hand.â€

â€œOh, dear,â€ I said. â€œOh, dear.â€ I didnâ€™t want to think of any of itâ€”not Tomâ€™s clear gray look and the calling of gulls, not the lines of affliction that carved his face into pieces, not the thought of what he had suffered, in loss, in guilt, in suspicionâ€”in fear. Nor did I want to think of Malva, going unwitting to that death among the lettuces, her son heavy and peaceful in her womb. Nor the dark rusty blood drying in gouts and splashes among the leaves of the grapevines.

Above all, I didnâ€™t want to think that I had had any part in this tragedyâ€”but that was inescapable.

I swallowed, hard.

â€œJamieâ€”can it ever be made right?â€

He held my hand now, in his other hand, stroking his thumb gently back and forth under my fingers.

â€œThe lass is dead, mo chridhe.â€

I closed my hand on his thumb, stilling it.

â€œYes, and someone killed herâ€”and it wasnâ€™t Tom. Oh, God, Jamieâ€”who? Who was it?â€

â€œI dinna ken,â€ he said, and his eyes grew deep with sadness. â€œShe was a lass who craved love, I thinkâ€”and took it. But she didna ken how to give it back again.â€

I took a deep breath and asked the question that had lain unspoken between us since the murder.

â€œYou donâ€™t think it was Ian?â€

He nearly smiled at that.

â€œIf it had been, a nighean, weâ€™d know. Ian could kill; he couldna let you or me suffer for it.â€

I sighed, shifting my shoulders to ease the knot between them. He was right, and I felt comforted, on Ianâ€™s accountâ€”and still more guilty, on Tom Christieâ€™s.

â€œThe man who fathered her childâ€”if that wasnâ€™t Ian, and I so hope it wasnâ€™tâ€”or someone who wanted her and killed her from jealousy when he found she was pregnantâ€”â€

â€œOr someone already wed. Or a woman, Sassenach.â€

That stopped me cold. â€œA woman?â€

â€œShe took love,â€ he repeated, and shook his head. â€œWhat makes ye think it was only the young men she took it from?â€

I closed my eyes, envisioning the possibilities. If she had had an affair with a married manâ€”and they had looked at her, too, only more discreetlyâ€”yes, he might have killed her to keep it undiscovered. Or a scorned wife . . . I had a brief, shocking glimpse of Murdina Bug, face contorted with effort as she pressed the pillow over Lionel Brownâ€™s face. Arch? God, no. Once again, with a sense of utter hopelessness, I turned away from the question, seeing in mind the myriad faces of Fraserâ€™s Ridgeâ€”one of them hiding a murdererâ€™s soul.

â€œNo, I know it canâ€™t be fixed for themâ€”not Malva, or Tom. Orâ€”or even Allan.â€ For the first time, I spared a thought for Tomâ€™s son, so suddenly bereft of his family and in such dreadful circumstances. â€œBut the rest . . .â€ The Ridge, I meant. Home. The life we had had. Us.

It had grown warm under the quilt, lying togetherâ€”too warm, and I felt the heat of a hot flush wash over me. I sat up abruptly, throwing off the quilt, and leaned forward, lifting the hair off my neck in hopes of an instantâ€™s coolness.

â€œStand up, Sassenach.â€

Jamie rolled out of bed, stood up, and took me by the hand, pulling me to my feet. Sweat had already broken out on my body like dew, and my cheeks were flushed. He bent and, taking the hem of my shift in both hands, stripped it off over my head.

He smiled faintly, looking at me, then bent and blew softly over my breasts. The coolness was a tiny but blessed relief, and my nipples rose in silent gratitude.

He opened the shutters for more air, then stepped back and pulled off his own shirt. Day had broken fully now, and the flood of pure morning light glimmered on the lines of his pale torso, on the silver web of his scars, the red-gold dusting of hair on his arms and legs, the rust and silver hairs of his sprouting beard. Likewise on the darkly suffused flesh of his genitals in their morning state, standing stiff against his belly and gone the deep, soft color one would find in the heart of a shadowed rose.

â€œAs to putting things right,â€ he said, â€œI canna sayâ€”though I mean to try.â€ His eyes moved over meâ€”stark naked, slightly salt-encrusted, and noticeably grimy about the feet and ankles. He smiled. â€œShall we make a start, Sassenach?â€

â€œYouâ€™re so tired you can barely stand up,â€ I protested. â€œUmâ€”with certain exceptions,â€ I added, glancing down. It was true; there were dark hollows under his eyes, and while the lines of his body were still long and graceful, they were also eloquent of deep fatigue. I felt as though Iâ€™d been run over by a steamroller myself, and I hadnâ€™t been up all night burning down forts.

â€œWell, seeing as weâ€™ve a bed to hand, I didna plan to stand up for it,â€ he replied. â€œMind, I may never get back on my feet again, but I think I might be able to stay awake for the next ten minutes or so, at least. Ye can pinch me if I fall asleep,â€ he suggested, smiling.

I rolled my eyes at him, but didnâ€™t argue. I lay down upon the grubby but now-cool sheets, and with a small tremor in the pit of my stomach, opened my legs for him.

We made love like people underwater, heavy-limbed and slow. Mute, able to speak only through crude pantomime. We had barely touched one another in this way since Malvaâ€™s deathâ€”and the thought of her was still with us.

And not only her. For a time, I tried to focus only on Jamie, fixing my attention on the small intimacies of his body, so well knownâ€”the tiny white cicatrice of the triangular scar at his throat, the whorls of auburn hair and the sunburned skin beneathâ€”but I was so tired that my mind refused to cooperate, and persisted in showing me instead random bits of memory or, even more disturbing, imagination.

â€œItâ€™s no good,â€ I said. My eyes were shut tight, and I was clinging to the bedclothes with both hands, sheets knotted in my fingers. â€œI canâ€™t.â€

He made a small sound of surprise, but at once rolled away, leaving me damp and trembling.

â€œWhat is it, a nighean?â€ he said softly. He didnâ€™t touch me, but lay close.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I said, close to panic. â€œI keep seeingâ€”Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m sorry, Jamie. I see other people; itâ€™s like Iâ€™m making love to other m-men.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ He sounded cautious, but not upset. There was a whish of fabric, and he drew the sheet up over me. That helped a little, but not much. My heart was pounding hard in my chest, I felt dizzy and couldnâ€™t seem to take a full breath; my throat kept closing.

Bolus hystericus, I thought, quite calmly. Do stop, Beauchamp. Easier said than done, but I did stop worrying that I was having a heart attack.

â€œAh . . .â€ Jamieâ€™s voice was cautious. â€œWho? Hodgepile andâ€”â€

â€œNo!â€ My stomach clenched in revulsion at the thought. I swallowed. â€œNo, Iâ€”I hadnâ€™t even thought of that.â€

He lay quietly beside me, breathing. I felt as though I were literally coming apart.

â€œWho is it that ye see, Claire?â€ he whispered. â€œCan ye tell me?â€

â€œFrank,â€ I said, fast, before I could change my mind. â€œAnd Tom. Andâ€”and Malva.â€ My chest heaved, and I felt that I would never have air enough to breathe again.

â€œI couldâ€”all of a sudden, I could feel them all,â€ I blurted. â€œTouching me. Wanting to come in.â€ I rolled over, burying my face in the pillow, as though I could seal out everything.

Jamie was silent for a long time. Had I hurt him? I was sorry that Iâ€™d told himâ€”but I had no defenses anymore. I could not lie, even for the best of reasons; there was simply no place to go, nowhere to hide. I felt beset by whispering ghosts, their loss, their need, their desperate love pulling me apart. Apart from Jamie, apart from myself.

My entire body was clenched and rigid, trying to keep from dissolution, and my face was pushed so deep into the pillow, trying to escape, that I felt I might suffocate, and was obliged to turn my head, gasping for breath.

â€œClaire.â€ Jamieâ€™s voice was soft, but I felt his breath on my face and my eyes popped open. His eyes were soft, too, shadowed with sorrow. Very slowly, he lifted a hand and touched my lips.

â€œTom,â€ I blurted. â€œI feel as though heâ€™s already dead, because of me, and itâ€™s so terrible. I canâ€™t bear it, Jamie, I really canâ€™t!â€

â€œI know.â€ He moved his hand, hesitated. â€œCan ye bear it if I touch ye?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ I swallowed the lump in my throat. â€œTry it and see.â€

That made him smile, though Iâ€™d spoken with complete seriousness. He put his hand gently on my shoulder and turned me, then gathered me against him, moving slowly, so that I might pull back. I didnâ€™t.

I sank into him, and clung to him as though he was a floating spar, the only thing keeping me from drowning. He was.

He held me close and stroked my hair for a long time.

â€œCan ye weep for them, mo nighean donn?â€ he whispered into my hair at last. â€œLet them come in.â€

The mere idea made me go rigid with panic again. â€œI canâ€™t.â€

â€œWeep for them,â€ he whispered, and his voice opened me deeper than his cock. â€œYe canna hold a ghost at bay.â€

â€œI canâ€™t. Iâ€™m afraid,â€ I said, but I was already shaking with grief, tears wet on my face. â€œI canâ€™t!â€

And yet I did. Gave up the struggle and opened myself, to memory and sorrow. Sobbed as though my heart would breakâ€”and let it break, for them, and all I could not save.

â€œLet them come, and grieve them, Claire,â€ he whispered. â€œAnd when theyâ€™ve gone, Iâ€™ll take ye home.â€

OLD MASTER




River Run

IT HAD RAINED HARD THE NIGHT BEFORE, and while the sun had come out bright and hot, the ground was soggy and steam seemed to rise from it, adding to the thickness of the air. Brianna had put her hair up, to keep it off her neck, but wisps escaped constantly, clinging damply to forehead and cheeks, always in her eyes. She wiped a strand away crossly with the back of her hand; her fingers were smeared with the pigment she was grindingâ€”and the humidity wasnâ€™t doing that any good, making the powder clump and cling to the sides of the mortar.

She needed it, though; she had a new commission, due to start this afternoon.

Jem was hanging round, too, bored and poking his fingers into everything. He was singing to himself, half under his breath; she paid no attention, until she happened to catch a few words.

â€œWhat did you say?â€ she asked, rounding on him incredulously. He couldnâ€™t have been singing â€œFolsom Prison Bluesâ€â€”could he?

He blinked at her, lowered his chin to his chest, and saidâ€”in the deepest voice he could produceâ€”â€œHello. Iâ€™m Johnny Cash.â€

She narrowly stopped herself laughing out loud, feeling her cheeks go pink with the effort of containment.

â€œWhere did you get that?â€ she asked, though she knew perfectly well. There was only one place he could have gotten it, and her heart rose up at the thought.

â€œDaddy,â€ he said logically.

â€œHas Daddy been singing?â€ she asked, trying to sound casual. He had to have been. And, just as obviously, had to have been trying Claireâ€™s advice, to shift the register of his voice so as to loosen his frozen vocal cords.

â€œUh-huh. Daddy sings a lot. He teached me the song about Sunday morning, and the one about Tom Dooley, and . . . and lots,â€ he ended, rather at a loss.

â€œDid he? Well, thatâ€™sâ€”put that down!â€ she said, as he idly picked up an open pouch of rose madder.

â€œOops.â€ He looked guiltily at the blob of paint that had erupted from the leather pouch and landed on his shirt, then at her, and made a tentative move toward the door.

â€œOops, he says,â€ she said darkly. â€œDonâ€™t you move!â€ Snaking out a hand, she grabbed him by the collar and applied a turpentine-soaked rag vigorously to the front of his shirt, succeeding only in producing a large pink blotch rather than a vivid red line.

Jem was silent during this ordeal, head bobbing as she pulled him to and fro, swabbing.

â€œWhat are you doing in here, anyway?â€ she demanded crossly. â€œDidnâ€™t I tell you to go find something to do?â€ There was no shortage of things to do at River Run, after all.

He hung his head and muttered something, in which she made out the word â€œscared.â€

â€œScared? Of what?â€ A little more gently, she pulled the shirt off over his head.

â€œThe ghost.â€

â€œWhat ghost?â€ she asked warily, not sure yet how to handle this. She was aware that all of the slaves at River Run believed implicitly in ghosts, simply as a fact of life. So did virtually all of the Scottish settlers in Cross Creek, Campbelton, and the Ridge. And the Germans from Salem and Bethania. So, for that matter, did her own father.

She could not simply inform Jem that there was no such thing as a ghostâ€”particularly as she was not entirely convinced of that herself.

â€œMaighistear Ã rsaidhâ€™s ghost,â€ he said, looking up at her for the first time, his dark blue eyes troubled. â€œJosh says heâ€™s been walkinâ€™.â€

Something skittered down her back like a centipede. Maighistear Ã rsaidh was Old Masterâ€”Hector Cameron. Involuntarily, she glanced toward the window. They were in the small room above the stable block where she did the messier bits of paint preparation, and Hector Cameronâ€™s white marble mausoleum was clearly visible from here, gleaming like a tooth at the side of the lawn below.

â€œWhat makes Josh say that, I wonder?â€ she said, stalling for time. Her first impulse was to observe that ghosts didnâ€™t walk in broad daylightâ€”but the obvious corollary to that was that they did walk by night, and the last thing she wanted to do was give Jem nightmares.

â€œHe says Angelina saw him, night before last. A big olâ€™ ghost,â€ he said, stretching up, hands clawed, and widening his eyes in obvious imitation of Joshâ€™s account.

â€œYeah? What was he doing?â€ She kept her tone light, only mildly interested, and it seemed to be working; Jem was more interested than scared, for the moment.

â€œWalkinâ€™,â€ Jem said with a small shrug. What else did ghosts do, after all?

â€œWas he smoking a pipe?â€ Sheâ€™d caught sight of a tall gentleman strolling under the trees on the lawn below, and had an idea.

Jem looked somewhat taken aback at the notion of a pipe-smoking ghost.

â€œI dunno,â€ he said dubiously. â€œDo ghosts smoke pipes?â€

â€œI sort of doubt it,â€ she said. â€œBut Mr. Buchanan does. See him down there on the lawn?â€ She moved aside, gesturing toward the window with her chin, and Jem rose up on his toes to look out over the sill. Mr. Buchanan, an acquaintance of Duncanâ€™s who was staying at the house, was in fact smoking a pipe at this very moment; the faint aroma of his tobacco reached them through the open window.

â€œI think probably Angelina saw Mr. Buchanan walking around in the dark,â€ she said. â€œMaybe he was in his nightshirt, going out to the necessary, and she just saw the white and thought he was a ghost.â€

Jem giggled at the thought. He seemed willing to be reassured, but hunched his skinny shoulders, peering closely at Mr. Buchanan.

â€œJosh says Angelina says the ghost was cominâ€™ out of old Mr. Hectorâ€™s tomb,â€ he said.

â€œI expect Mr. Buchanan just walked round it, and she saw him coming along the side, and thought he was coming out of it,â€ she said, carefully avoiding any question as to why a middle-aged Scottish gentleman should be walking round tombs in his nightshirt; obviously, that wasnâ€™t a notion that struck Jemmy as odd.

It did occur to her to ask just what Angelina was doing outside in the middle of the night seeing ghosts, but on second thought, better not. The most likely reason for a maidâ€™s stealing out at night wasnâ€™t something a boy of Jemmyâ€™s age needed to hear about, either.

Her lips tightened a little at the thought of Malva Christie, who had perhaps gone to a rendezvous of her own in Claireâ€™s garden. Who? she wondered for the thousandth time, even as she automatically crossed herself, with a brief prayer for the repose of Malvaâ€™s soul. Who had it been? If ever there were a ghost that should walk . . .

A small shiver passed over her, but that in turn gave her a new idea.

â€œI think it was Mr. Buchanan Angelina saw,â€ she said firmly. â€œBut if you ever should be afraid of ghostsâ€”or anything elseâ€”you just make the Sign of the Cross, and say a quick prayer to your guardian angel.â€

The words gave her a slight sense of dizzinessâ€”perhaps it was dÃ©jÃ  vu. She thought that someoneâ€”her mother? her father?â€”had said exactly that to her, sometime in the distant past of her childhood. What she had been afraid of? She no longer remembered that, but did remember the sense of security that the prayer had given her.

Jem frowned uncertainly at that; he knew the Sign of the Cross, but wasnâ€™t so sure about the angel prayer. She rehearsed it with him, feeling slightly guilty as she did so.

It was only a matter of time before he did something overtly Catholicâ€”like make the Sign of the Crossâ€”in front of someone who mattered to Roger. For the most part, people either assumed that the ministerâ€™s wife was Protestant, as wellâ€”or knew the truth, but were in no position to make a fuss about it. She was aware of a certain amount of muttering amongst Rogerâ€™s flock, particularly in the wake of Malvaâ€™s death and the talk about her parentsâ€”she felt her lips press tight again, and consciously relaxed themâ€”but Roger steadfastly refused to hear any such remarks.

She felt a deep pang of longing for Roger, even with the worrying thought of potential religious complications fresh in her mind. Heâ€™d written; Elder McCorkle had been delayed, but should be in Edenton within the week. A week more, maybe, before the Presbytery Session convenedâ€”and then heâ€™d be coming to River Run for her and Jem.

He was so happy at the thought of his ordination; surely once he was ordained, they couldnâ€™t defrock himâ€”if thatâ€™s what happened to miscreant ministersâ€”for having a Catholic wife, could they?

Would she convert, if she had to, for Roger to be what he so clearly wantedâ€”and neededâ€”to be? The thought made her feel hollow, and she put her arms round Jemmy for reassurance. His skin was damp and still baby-soft, but she could feel the hardness of his bones pressing through, giving promise of a size that would likely one day match his father and grandfather. His fatherâ€”there was a small, glowing thought that calmed all her anxieties, and even soothed the ache of missing Roger.

Jemmyâ€™s hair had long since grown again, but she kissed the spot behind his left ear where the hidden mark was, making him hunch his shoulders and giggle at the tickle of her breath on his neck.

She sent him off then, to take the paint-stained shirt to Matilda the laundress to see what might be done, and went back to her grinding.

The mineral smell of the malachite in her mortar seemed vaguely wrong; she lifted it and sniffed, even as she did so aware that that was ridiculous: ground stone couldnâ€™t go bad. Maybe the mixture of turpentine and the fumes from Mr. Buchananâ€™s pipe was affecting her sense of smell. She shook her head, and scraped the soft green powder carefully out into a vial, to be mixed with walnut oil or used in an egg tempera later.

She cast an appraising eye over the selection of boxes and pouchesâ€”some supplied by Aunt Jocasta, others courtesy of John Grey, sent specially from Londonâ€”and the vials and drying trays of the pigments sheâ€™d ground herself, to see what else might be needed.

This afternoon, sheâ€™d only be making preliminary sketchesâ€”the commission was for a portrait of Mr. Forbesâ€™s ancient motherâ€”but she might have only a week or two to finish the job before Rogerâ€™s return; she couldnâ€™t wasteâ€”

A wave of dizziness made her sit down suddenly, and black spots flickered through her vision. She put her head between her knees, breathing deep. That didnâ€™t help; the air was raw with turps, and thick with the meaty, decaying animal smells of the stables below.

She lifted her head, and grabbed for the edge of the table. Her insides seemed to have turned abruptly to a liquid substance that shifted with her movement like water in a bowl, sloshing from belly to throat and back, leaving the bitter yellow smell of bile at the back of her nose.

â€œOh, God.â€

The liquid in her belly rushed up her throat, and she had barely time to seize the washbasin from the table and dump the water on the floor before her stomach turned inside out in the frantic effort to empty itself.

She set the basin down, very carefully, and sat panting, staring at the wet blotch on the floor, as the world beneath her shifted on its axis and settled at a new, uneasy angle.

â€œCongratulations, Roger,â€ she said out loud, her voice sounding faint and uncertain in the close, damp air. â€œI think youâ€™re going to be a daddy. Again.â€



SHE SAT STILL for some time, cautiously exploring the sensations of her body, looking for certainty. She hadnâ€™t been sick with Jemmyâ€”but she remembered the oddly altered quality of her senses; that odd state called synesthesia, where sight, smell, taste, and even sometimes hearing occasionally and weirdly took on characteristics of each other.

It had gone away as abruptly as it had happened; the tang of Mr. Buchananâ€™s tobacco was much stronger, but now it was only the mellow burning of cured leaves, not a mottled green-brown thing that writhed through her sinuses and rattled the membranes of her brain like a tin roof in a hailstorm.

She had been concentrating so hard on her bodily sensations and what they might or might not mean that she hadnâ€™t really noticed the voices in the next room. That was Duncanâ€™s modest lair, where he kept the ledgers and accounts of the estate andâ€”she thoughtâ€”went to hide, when the grandeur of the house became too much for him.

Mr. Buchanan was in there with Duncan now, and what had started out as a genial thrum of conversation was now showing signs of strain. She got up, relieved to feel only a slight residual clamminess now, and picked up the basin. She had the natural human inclinations toward eavesdropping, but lately, she had been careful not to hear anything but what she must.

Duncan and her aunt Jocasta were stout Loyalists, and nothing she could say by way of tactful urging or logical argument would sway them. She had overheard more than one of Duncanâ€™s private conversations with local Tories that made her heart go small with apprehension, knowing as she did what would be the outcome of the present events.

Here in the piedmont, in the heart of the Cape Fear country, most of the solid citizens were Loyalists, convinced that the violence taking place to the north was an overblown rumpus that might be unnecessary, and if it was not, had little to do with themâ€”and that what was most needed here was a firm hand to rein in the wild-eyed Whigs, before their excesses provoked a ruinous retaliation. Knowing that exactly such a ruinous retaliation was comingâ€”and to people she liked, or even lovedâ€”gave her what her father called the grue: a cold sense of oppressive horror, coiling through the blood.

â€œWhen, then?â€ Buchananâ€™s voice came clearly as she opened the door, sounding impatient. â€œThey will not wait, Duncan. I must have the money by Wednesday week, or Dunkling will sell the arms elsewhere; ye ken itâ€™s a sellerâ€™s market the noo. For gold, heâ€™ll waitâ€”but not for long.â€

â€œAye, I ken that fine, Sawny.â€ Duncan sounded impatientâ€”and very uneasy, Brianna thought. â€œIf it can be done, it will be.â€

â€œIF?â€ Buchanan cried. â€œWhat is this â€˜ifâ€™? â€™Til now, itâ€™s been, oh, aye, Sawny, nay difficulty, to be sure, Sawny, tell Dunkling itâ€™s on, oh, of course, Sawnyâ€”â€

â€œI said, Alexander, that if it can be done, it will.â€ Duncanâ€™s voice was low, but suddenly had a note of steel in it that she had never heard before.

Buchanan said something rude in the Gaelic, and suddenly the door of Duncanâ€™s office burst open and the man himself popped out, in so great a huff that he barely saw her, and gave her no more than a brusque nod in passing.

Which was just as well, she thought, since she was standing there holding a bowl full of vomit.

Before she could move to dispose of it, Duncan came out in turn. He looked hot, crossâ€”and extremely worried. He did, however, notice her.

â€œHow dâ€™ye fare, lass?â€ he asked, squinting at her. â€œYeâ€™re that bit green; have ye eaten aught amiss?â€

â€œI think so. But Iâ€™m all right now,â€ she said, hastily turning to put the basin back in the room behind her. She set it on the floor and closed the door on it. â€œAre you, er, all right, Duncan?â€

He hesitated for an instant, but whatever was bothering him was too overwhelming to keep it bottled up. He glanced about, but none of the slaves was up here at this time of day. He leaned close, nonetheless, and lowered his voice.

â€œHave ye by chance . . . seen anything peculiar, a nighean?â€

â€œPeculiar, how?â€

He rubbed a knuckle under his drooping mustache, and glanced round once more.

â€œNear Hector Cameronâ€™s tomb, say?â€ he asked, his voice pitched only just above a whisper.

Her diaphragm, still sore from vomiting, contracted sharply at that, and she put a hand to her middle.

â€œYe have, then?â€ Duncanâ€™s expression sharpened.

â€œNot me,â€ she said, and explained about Jemmy, Angelina, and the supposed ghost.

â€œI thought perhaps it was Mr. Buchanan,â€ she finished, nodding toward the stair down which Alexander Buchanan had vanished.

â€œNow, thereâ€™s a thought,â€ Duncan muttered, rubbing distractedly at his grizzled temple. â€œBut no . . . surely not. He couldnaâ€”but itâ€™s a thought.â€ Brianna thought that he looked very slightly more hopeful.

â€œDuncanâ€”can you tell me whatâ€™s wrong?â€

He took a deep breath, shaking his headâ€”not in refusal, but in perplexityâ€”and let it out again, his shoulders slumping.

â€œThe gold,â€ he said simply. â€œItâ€™s gone.â€



SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS in gold bullion was a substantial amount, in all senses of the word. She had no idea how much such a sum might weigh, but it had completely lined Jocastaâ€™s coffin, standing chastely next to Hector Cameronâ€™s in the family mausoleum.

â€œWhat do you mean â€˜goneâ€™?â€ she blurted. â€œAll of it?â€

Duncan clutched her arm, features contorted in the urge to shush her.

â€œAye, all of it,â€ he said, looking round yet again. â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, lass, keep your voice down!â€

â€œWhen did it go? Or rather,â€ she amended, â€œwhen you did find it gone?â€

â€œLast night.â€ He looked round yet again, and jerked his chin toward his office. â€œCome in, lass; Iâ€™ll tell ye about it.â€

Duncanâ€™s agitation subsided a little as he told her the story; by the time he had finished, he had regained a certain amount of outward calm.

The seven thousand pounds was what was left of the original ten thousand, which in turn was one-third of the thirty thousand sentâ€”too late, but sent nonethelessâ€”from Louis of France in support of Charles Stuartâ€™s doomed attempt on the thrones of England and Scotland.

â€œHector was careful, aye?â€ Duncan explained. â€œHe lived as a rich man, but always within such means as a place like thisâ€â€”he waved his one hand around, indicating the grounds and messuages of River Runâ€”â€œmight provide. He spent a thousand pound acquiring the land and building the house, then over the years, another thousand in slaves, cattle, and the like. And a thousand pound he put to the bankersâ€”Jo said he couldna bear the thought of all that money sitting, earning nay interestâ€â€”he gave her a small, wry smileâ€”â€œthough he was too clever to attract attention by putting it all out. I suppose he meant, maybe, to invest the rest, a bit at a timeâ€”but he died before that was done.â€

Leaving Jocasta as a very wealthy widowâ€”but even more cautious than her husband had been about attracting undue attention. And so the gold had sat, safe in its hiding place, save for the one ingot being gradually whittled away and disposed of by Ulysses. Which had disappeared, she remembered with a qualm. Someone knew there was gold here.

Perhaps whoever had taken that ingot had guessed that there was moreâ€”and hunted, quietly, patiently, until they found it.

But nowâ€”

â€œYeâ€™ll have heard about General MacDonald?â€

Sheâ€™d heard the name frequently of late, in conversationâ€”he was a Scottish general, more or less retired, sheâ€™d assumedâ€”who had been staying here and there, the guest of various prominent families. She hadnâ€™t heard of his purpose, though.

â€œHe means to raise menâ€”three thousand, fourâ€”among the Highlanders, to march to the coast. The Governorâ€™s sent for aid; troopships are coming. So the Generalâ€™s men will come down through the Cape Fear valleyâ€â€”he made a graceful swooping gesture with his handâ€”â€œmeet the Governor and his troopsâ€”and pincer the rebel militias that are a-building.â€

â€œAnd you meant to give him the goldâ€”or no,â€ she corrected herself. â€œYou meant to give him arms and powder.â€

He nodded and chewed his mustaches, looking unhappy.

â€œA man named Dunkling; Alexander knows him. Lord Dunsmore is gathering a great store of powder and arms in Virginia, and Dunkling is one of his lieutenantsâ€”and willing to give up some of that store, in return for gold.â€

â€œWhich is now gone.â€ She took a deep breath, feeling sweat trickle down between her breasts, further dampening her shift.

â€œWhich is now gone,â€ he agreed bleakly. â€œAnd Iâ€™m left to wonder what about this ghost of wee Jemâ€™s, aye?â€

Ghost, indeed. For someone to have entered a place like River Run, teeming with people, and to have moved several hundred pounds by weight of gold, completely unnoticed . . .

The sound of feet on the stairs caused Duncan to jerk his head sharply toward the door, but it was only Josh, one of the black grooms, his hat in his hand.

â€œBest we be going, Miss Bree,â€ he said, bowing respectfully. â€œIf ye be wanting the light, like?â€

For her drawings, he meant. It was a good hourâ€™s trip into Cross Creek to lawyer Forbesâ€™s house, and the sun was rising fast toward noon.

She glanced at her green-smeared fingers, and recalled the hair straggling untidily down from its makeshift bun; sheâ€™d have to tidy herself a bit first.

â€œGo, lass.â€ Duncan waved her toward the door, his lean face still creased with worry but lightened a little by having shared it.

She kissed him affectionately on the forehead and went down after Josh. She was worried, and not only about missing gold and prowling ghosts. General MacDonald, indeed. For if he meant to raise fighting men among the Highlanders, one of the natural places for him to go was to her father.

As Roger had noted to her sometime earlier, â€œJamie can walk the tightrope between Whigs and Tories better than any man I knowâ€”but when push comes to shove . . . heâ€™ll have to jump.â€

The push had come at Mecklenberg. But shove, she thought, was named MacDonald.

A TRIP TO THE SEASIDE




NEIL FORBES, thinking it prudent to be absent from his usual haunts for a time, had removed to Edenton, with the excuse of taking his aged mother to visit her even more aged sister. He had enjoyed the long journey, in spite of his motherâ€™s complaints about the clouds of dust raised by another carriage that preceded them.

He had been loath to sacrifice his sight of that carriageâ€”a small, well-sprung affair, whose windows were sealed and heavily curtained. But he had always been a devoted son, and at the next post stop, he went to speak to the driver. The other coach obligingly dropped back, following them at a convenient distance.

â€œWhatever are ye lookinâ€™ at, Neil?â€ his mother demanded, looking up from fastening her favorite garnet brooch. â€œThatâ€™s the third time yeâ€™ve had a peek out thon window.â€

â€œNot a thing, Mam,â€ he said, inhaling deeply. â€œOnly taking pleasure in the day. Such beautiful weather, is it not?â€

Mrs. Forbes sniffed, but obligingly settled her spectacles on her nose and leaned to peer out.

â€œAye, weel, itâ€™s fair enough,â€ she admitted dubiously. â€œHot, though, and damp enough to wring buckets from your shirt.â€

â€œNever mind, a leannan,â€ he said, patting her black-clad shoulder. â€œWeâ€™ll be in Edenton afore ye know. Itâ€™ll be cooler there. Nothing like a sea-breeze, so they say, to put the roses in your cheeks!â€

NIGHTWATCH




Edenton

THE REVEREND MCMILLANâ€™S HOUSE was on the water. A blessing in the hot, muggy weather. The offshore breeze in the evening swept everything awayâ€”heat, hearth smoke, mosquitoes. The men sat on the big porch after supper, smoking their pipes and enjoying the respite.

Rogerâ€™s enjoyment was spiced by the guilty awareness that Mrs. Reverend McMillan and her three daughters were sweating to and fro, washing dishes, clearing away, sweeping floors, boiling up the leftover ham bones from supper with lentils for tomorrowâ€™s soup, putting children to bed, and generally slaving away in the stuffy, sweltering confines of the house. At home, he would have felt obliged to help with such work, or face Briannaâ€™s wrath; here, such an offer would have been received with drop-jawed incredulity, followed by deep suspicion. Instead, he sat peacefully in the cool evening breeze, watching fishing boats come in across the water of the sound and sipping something that passed for coffee, engaged in pleasant male conversation.

There was, he thought, occasionally something to be said for the eighteenth-century model of sexual roles.

They were talking over the news from the south: the flight of Governor Martin from New Bern, the burning of Fort Johnston. The political climate of Edenton was strongly Whiggish, and the company was largely clericalâ€”the Reverend Doctor McCorkle, his secretary Warren Lee, the Reverend Jay McMillan, Reverend Patrick Dugan, and four â€œinquirersâ€ awaiting ordination besides Rogerâ€”but there were still currents of political disagreement flowing beneath the outwardly cordial surface of the conversation.

Roger himself said little; he didnâ€™t wish to offend McMillanâ€™s hospitality by contributing to any argumentâ€”and something inside him wished for quiet, to contemplate tomorrow.

Then the conversation took a new turn, though, and he found himself paying rapt attention. The Continental Congress had met in Philadelphia two months before, and given General Washington command of the Continental army. Warren Lee had been in Philadelphia at the time, and was giving the company a vivid account of the battle at Breedâ€™s Hill, at which he had been present.

â€œGeneral Putnam, he brought up wagonloads of dirt and brush, to the neck of the Charlestown peninsulaâ€”you said you knew it, sir?â€ he asked, courteously turning toward Roger. â€œWell, Colonel Prescott, heâ€™s there already, with two militia compâ€™nies from Massachusetts, and parts of another from Connecticutâ€”was mebbe a thousand men in all, and dear Lord, was they a stench from the camps!â€

His soft Southern accentâ€”Lee was a Virginianâ€”held a slight touch of amusement, but this faded as he went on.

â€œGeneral Ward, heâ€™d give orders to fortify this one hill, Bunker Hill, they call it, for an old redoubt atop. But Colonel Prescott, he goes up it and donâ€™t care so much for the looks, him and Mr. Gridley, the engineer. So they leave a detachment there, and go on to Breedâ€™s Hill, what they think is maybe better to the purpose, beinâ€™ closer to the harbor.

â€œNow, this is all at night, mind. I was with one of the Massachusetts companies, and we marched right smart, then spent the whole night through, â€™twixt midnight and dawn, digginâ€™ trenches and raising up six-foot walls about the perimeter.

â€œCome the dawn, and we skulked down behind our fortifications, and just in time, too, for thereâ€™s a British ship in the harborâ€”the Lively, they saidâ€”and she opens fire the minute the sunâ€™s up. Looked right pretty, for the fog was still on the water and the cannon lit it up in red flashes. Did no harm, though; most all the balls fell short into the harborâ€”did see one whaleboat at the docks hit, though; stove it like kindling. The crew, theyâ€™d hopped out like fleas when the Lively took to firing. From where I was, I could just see â€™em, hoppinâ€™ up and down on the dock, a-shakinâ€™ their fistsâ€”then the Lively let off another broadside, and they all fell flat or run like rabbits.â€

The light was nearly gone, and Leeâ€™s young face invisible in the shadows, but the amusement in his voice made a small rumble of laughter run among the other men.

â€œThey was some firinâ€™ from a little battery up on Coppâ€™s Hill, and one or two of the other ships, they let off a pop or two, but they could see â€™twanâ€™t no earthly use and ceased. Then come in some fellows from New Hampshire to join up with us, and that was purely heartening. But General Putnam, he sends a good many men back to work on the fortifications at Bunker, and the New Hampshire folk, theyâ€™re crouched way down on the left, where theyâ€™s got no cover beyond rail fences stuffed with mown grass. Lookinâ€™ at â€™em down there, I was pleased as punch to have four feet of solid earthwork in front of me, I tell you, gentlemen.â€

The British troops had set out across the Charles River, bold as brass under the midday sun, with the warships behind them and the batteries on shore all providing covering fire.

â€œWe didnâ€™t fire back, of course. Had no cannon,â€ Lee said with an audible shrug.

Roger, listening intently, couldnâ€™t keep from asking a question at this point.

â€œIs it true that Colonel Stark said, â€˜Donâ€™t fire until you see the whites of their eyesâ€™?â€

Lee coughed discreetly.

â€œWell, sir. I couldnâ€™t say for sure as no one said that, but I didnâ€™t hear it myself. Mind, I did hear one colonel call out, â€˜Any whoreson fool wastes his powder afore the bastards are close enough to kill is gonna get his musket shoved up his arse butt-first!â€™â€

The assembly erupted into laughter. An inquiry from Mrs. McMillan, who had come out to offer further refreshment, as to the source of this merriment shut them all up sharp, though, and they listened with a fair assumption of sober attention to the rest of Leeâ€™s account.

â€œWell, so, then, on they come, and I will say â€™twas a daunting sight. Theyâ€™d several regiments, and all in their different colors, fusiliers and grenadiers, Royal Marines, and a proper boiling of light infantry, all cominâ€™ on over the ground like a horde of ants, and just as mean.

â€œI wouldnâ€™t make great claim to bravery myself, gentlemen, but I would say the fellows standinâ€™ with me had some nerve. We did let â€™em come, and the first ranks werenâ€™t no more than ten feet away when our volley cut into them.

â€œThey rallied, came back on, and we cut them down againâ€”like ninepins. And the officersâ€”there was a powerful lot of the officers went; they were on their horses, see? Iâ€”I shot one such. He keeled over, but he didnâ€™t fall offâ€”his horse carried him away. Kind of lolling, with his head loose. But he didnâ€™t fall.â€

Leeâ€™s voice had lost some of its color, and Roger saw the burly form of the Reverend Doctor McCorkle lean toward his secretary, touching his shoulder.

â€œThey rallied a third time, and came on. And . . . we were most of us out of ammunition. They came on over the earthworks and through the fences. With their bayonets fixed.â€

Roger was sitting on the steps of the porch, Lee above him and several feet away, but could hear the young man swallow.

â€œWe fell back. Thatâ€™s how they say it. We ran, is what we did. Soâ€™d they.â€

He swallowed again.

â€œA bayonetâ€”it makes a terrible sound, goinâ€™ into a man. Justâ€”terrible. I canâ€™t say how it is, describe it properly. Heard it, though, and moreâ€™n once. Was a good many run straight through the body that dayâ€”skewered and then the steel pulled out, and they left to die on the ground, floppinâ€™ like fish.â€

Roger had seenâ€”handledâ€”eighteenth-century bayonets, often. A seventeen-inch triangular blade, heavy and brutal, with a blood groove down one side. He thought, quite suddenly, of the furrowed scar that ran up Jamie Fraserâ€™s thigh, and rose to his feet. Murmuring a brief excuse, he left the porch, and walked down the shore, pausing only for a moment to shed his shoes and stockings.

The tide was going out; sand and shingle were wet and cool under his bare feet. The breeze rattled faintly among palmetto leaves behind him, and a line of pelicans flew down the shore, solemn against the last of the light. He walked a little way into the surf, small rippling waves that tugged at his heels, sucking the sand away beneath him, making him shift and sway to keep his balance.

Far out on the water of Albemarle Sound, he could see lights; fishing boats, with small fires built in sandboxes aboard, to light the torches the fishermen swung over the side. These seemed to float in the air, swinging to and fro, their reflections in the water winking slowly in and out like fireflies.

The stars were coming out. He stood looking up, trying to empty his mind, his heart, open himself to the love of God.

Tomorrow, he would be a minister. Thou art a priest forever, said the ordination service, quoting from the Bible, after the order of Melchizedek.

â€œAre you afraid?â€ Brianna had asked him, when heâ€™d told her.

â€œYeah,â€ he said softly, aloud.

He stood until the tide left him, then followed it, walking into the water, wanting the rhythmic touch of the waves.

â€œWill you do it anyway?â€

â€œYeah,â€ he said, more softly still. He had no idea what he was agreeing to, but said it, anyway. Far down the beach behind him, the breeze brought him now and then a snatch of laughter, a few words from the Reverend McMillanâ€™s porch. They had moved on, then, from the talk of war and death.

Had any of them ever killed a man? Lee, perhaps. The Reverend Doctor McCorkle? He snorted a little at the thought, but did not dismiss it. He turned and walked a little further, until the only sounds were those of the waves and the offshore wind.

Soul-searching. It was what squires used to do, he thought, smiling a little wryly at the thought. The night before he became a knight, a young man would keep vigil in church or chapel, watching through the dark hours, lighted only by the glow of a sanctuary lamp, praying.

For what? he wondered. Purity of mind, singleness of purpose. Courage? Or perhaps forgiveness?

He hadnâ€™t meant to kill Randall Lillington; that had been almost accident, and what wasnâ€™t had been self-defense. But he had been hunting when he did it, had gone out looking for Stephen Bonnet, meaning to kill him in cold blood. And Harley Boble; he could still see the shine of the thieftakerâ€™s eyes, feel the echo of the blow, the shards of the manâ€™s skull reverberating through the bones of his own arm. Heâ€™d meant that, yes. Could have stopped. Didnâ€™t.

Tomorrow, he would swear before God that he believed in the doctrine of predestination, that he had been meant to do what he had done. Perhaps.

Maybe I donâ€™t believe that, so much, he thought, doubt stealing in. But maybe I do. Christâ€”oh, sorryâ€”he apologized mentallyâ€”can I be a proper minister, with doubts? I think everyoneâ€™s got them, but if Iâ€™ve got too manyâ€”maybe yeâ€™d best let me know now, before itâ€™s too late.

His feet had gone numb, and the sky was ablaze with a glory of stars, thick in the black velvet night. He heard the crunch of footsteps among the shingle and the sea wrack nearby.

It was Warren Leeâ€”tall and gangly by starlight, the Reverend Doctor McCorkleâ€™s secretary, erstwhile militiaman.

â€œThought Iâ€™d take a bit of air,â€ Lee said, his voice hardly audible above the hiss of the sea.

â€œAye, well, thereâ€™s a lot of it, and itâ€™s free,â€ Roger said as amiably as he could. Lee chuckled briefly in response, but luckily didnâ€™t seem disposed to talk.

They stood for some time, watching the fishing boats. Then, by unspoken consent, turned to go back. The house was dark, the porch deserted. A single candle burned in the window, though, lighting them home.

â€œThat officer, the one I shot,â€ Lee blurted suddenly. â€œI pray for him. Every night.â€

Lee shut up abruptly, embarrassed. Roger breathed slow and deep, feeling the jerk of his own heart. Had he ever prayed for Lillington, or Boble?

â€œI will, too,â€ he said.

â€œThank you,â€ said Lee very softly, and side by side, they made their way back up the beach, pausing to pick up their shoes, going back barefooted, sand drying on their feet.

They had sat down on the steps to brush it off before going in, when the door behind them opened.

â€œMr. MacKenzie?â€ said the Reverend McMillan, and something in his voice pulled Roger to his feet, heart pounding. â€œYou have a visitor.â€

He saw the tall silhouette behind McMillan, and knew, even before Jamie Fraserâ€™s pale, fierce face appeared, eyes black in the candlelight.

â€œHeâ€™s taken Brianna,â€ Jamie said without preamble. â€œYeâ€™ll come.â€

Anemone




FEET TRAMPLED BACK AND FORTH OVERHEAD, and she could hear voices, but most of the words were too muffled to make out. There was a chorus of jovial shouts on the side nearest shore, and cordial feminine shrieks in reply.

The cabin had a wide, paned windowâ€”did you call it a window on a ship, she wondered, or had it some special nautical name?â€”that ran behind the bunk, raked back with the angle of the stern. It was made in small, thick panes, set in leading. No hope there of escape, but it did offer the possibility of air, and perhaps information regarding their whereabouts.

Repressing a qualm of nauseated distaste, she clambered across the stained and rumpled sheets of the bed. She pressed close to the window and pushed her face into one of the open panes, taking deep breaths to dispel the aromas of the cabin, though the smell of the harbor was no great improvement, rife as it was with the smell of dead fish, sewage, and baking mud.

She could see a small dock, and moving figures on it. A fire was burning on the shore outside a low, whitewashed building roofed with palmetto leaves. It was too dark to see what, if anything, lay beyond the building. There must be at least a small town, though, judging from the noise of the people on the dock.

There were voices outside the cabin door, coming closer. â€œ. . . meet him on Ocracoke, the dark oâ€™ the moon,â€ said one, to which the other replied in an indistinct mumble, before the door flew open.

â€œCare to join the party, sweetheart? Or have ye started without me?â€

She whirled on her knees, heart hammering in her throat. Stephen Bonnet stood inside the door to the cabin, a bottle in one hand and a slight smile on his face. She took a deep breath to quell the shock, and nearly gagged on the stale scent of sex that wafted from the sheets under her knees. She scrambled off the bed, heedless of her clothes, and felt a rip at the waist as her knee caught in her skirt.

â€œWhere are we?â€ she demanded. Her voice sounded shrill, panicked to her own ears.

â€œOn the Anemone,â€ he said patiently, still smiling.

â€œYou know that isnâ€™t what I mean!â€ The neck of her gown and chemise had torn in the struggle when the men pulled her from her horse, and most of one breast was exposed; she put up a hand, pushing the fabric back in place.

â€œDo I?â€ He set the bottle on the desk, and reached to unfasten the stock from his neck. â€œAh, thatâ€™s better.â€ He rubbed at the dark red line across his throat, and she had a sudden, piercing vision of Rogerâ€™s throat, with its ragged scar.

â€œI wish to know what this town is called,â€ she said, deepening her voice and fixing him with a gimlet eye. She didnâ€™t expect that what worked on her fatherâ€™s tenants would work on him, but the assumption of an air of command helped to steady her a bit.

â€œWell, thatâ€™s an easily gratified wish, to be sure.â€ He waved a casual hand toward the shore. â€œRoanoke.â€ He shucked his coat, tossing it carelessly over the stool. The linen of his shirt was crumpled, and clung damply to his chest and shoulders.

â€œYeâ€™d best take off the gown, darlinâ€™; itâ€™s hot.â€

He reached for the strings that tied his shirt, and she moved abruptly away from the bed, glancing round the cabin, searching the shadows for something that could be used as a weapon. Stool, lamp, logbook, bottle . . . there. A piece of wood showed among the rubble on the desk, the blunt end of a marlinespike.

He frowned, attention fastened momentarily on a knot in the string. She took two long steps and seized the marlinespike, yanking it off the desk in a shower of rubbish and clanging oddments.

â€œStand back.â€ She held the thing like a baseball bat, gripped in both hands. Sweat streamed down the hollow of her back, but her hands felt cold and her face went hot and cold and hot again, ripples of heat and terror rolling down her skin.

Bonnet looked at her as though she had gone mad.

â€œWhatever will ye be after doing with that, woman?â€ He left off fiddling with his shirt and took a step toward her. She took one back, raising the club.

â€œDonâ€™t fucking touch me!â€

He stared at her, eyes fixed wide, pale green and unblinking above a small, odd smile. Still smiling, he took another step toward her. Then another, and the fear boiled off in a surge of rage. Her shoulders bunched and lifted, ready.

â€œI mean it! Stand back or Iâ€™ll kill you. Iâ€™ll know who this babyâ€™s father is, if I die for it!â€

He had raised a hand, as though to grasp the club and jerk it away from her, but at this, he stopped abruptly.

â€œBaby? You are with child?â€

She swallowed, her breath still thick in her throat. The blood hammered in her ears, and the smooth wood was slick with sweat from her palms. She tightened her grip, trying to keep the rage alive, but it was already dying.

â€œYes. I think so. Iâ€™ll know for sure in two weeks.â€

His sandy eyebrows lifted.

â€œHm!â€ With a short grunt, he stepped back, surveying her with interest. Slowly, his eyes traveled over her, appraising her one bared breast.

The sudden spurt of rage had drained away, leaving her breathless and empty-bellied. She kept hold of the marlinespike, but her wrists quivered, and she lowered it.

â€œIs that the way of it, then?â€

He leaned forward and reached out, quite without lascivious intent now. Startled, she froze for an instant, and he weighed the breast in one hand, kneading thoughtfully, as though it were a grapefruit he meant to buy at market. She gasped and hit at him one-handed with the club, but she had lost what readiness she had, and the blow bounced off his shoulder, rocking him but having little other effect. He grunted and stepped back, rubbing at his shoulder.

â€œCould be. Well, then.â€ He frowned, and tugged at the front of his breeches, adjusting himself without the slightest embarrassment. â€œLucky weâ€™re in port, I suppose.â€

She made no sense whatever of this remark, but didnâ€™t care; apparently he had changed his mind upon hearing her revelation, and the feeling of relief made her knees go weak and her skin prickle with sweat. She sat down, quite suddenly, upon the stool, the club clanking to the floor beside her.

Bonnet had put his head out into the corridor, and was bellowing for someone named Orden. Whoever Orden was, he didnâ€™t come into the cabin, but within a few moments, a voice mumbled interrogatively outside.

â€œFetch me down a whore from the docks,â€ Bonnet said, in the casual tone of one ordering a fresh pint of bitter. â€œClean, mind, and fairly young.â€

He shut the door then, and turned to the table, scrabbling through the debris until he unearthed a pewter cup. He poured a drink, quaffed half of it, and thenâ€”seeming belatedly to realize that she was still thereâ€”offered her the bottle with a vague â€œEh?â€ of invitation.

She shook her head, wordless. A faint hope had sprung up in the back of her mind. He did have some faint streak of gallantry, or at least decency; he had come back to rescue her from the burning warehouse, and he had left her the stone for what he assumed to be his child. Now he had abandoned his advances, upon hearing that she was with child again. Perhaps he would let her go, then, particularly if she was of no immediate use to him.

â€œSo . . . you donâ€™t want me?â€ she said, edging her feet under her, ready to leap up and run, as soon as the door opened to admit her replacement. She hoped she could run; her knees were still trembling with reaction.

Bonnet glanced at her, surprised.

â€œIâ€™ve split your quim once already, sweetheart,â€ he said, and grinned. â€œI recall the red hairâ€”a lovely sight, sureâ€”but it wasnâ€™t so memorable an experience otherwise that I canâ€™t be waitinâ€™ to repeat it. Time enough, darlinâ€™, time enough.â€ He chucked her negligently under the chin, and gulped more of his drink. â€œFor now, though, LeRoiâ€™s needing a bit of a gallop.â€

â€œWhy am I here?â€ she demanded.

Distracted, he pulled once more at the crotch of his breeches, quite unself-conscious of her presence.

â€œHere? Why, because a gentleman paid me to take ye to London-town, darlinâ€™. Didnâ€™t ye know?â€

She felt as though someone had hit her in the stomach, and sat down on the bed, folding her arms protectively across her midsection.

â€œWhat gentleman? And for Godâ€™s sakeâ€”why?â€

He considered for a moment, but evidently concluded that there was no reason not to tell her.

â€œA man named Forbes,â€ he said, and threw back the rest of his drink. â€œKnow him, do you?â€

â€œI most certainly do,â€ she said, amazement vying with fury. â€œThat bloody bastard!â€ So they were Forbesâ€™s men, the masked bandits that had stopped her and Josh, dragged them from their horses, and shoved them both into a sealed carriage, bumping over unseen roads for days on end, until they reached the coast, and then been pulled out, disheveled and reeking, and bundled aboard the ship.

â€œWhereâ€™s Joshua?â€ she asked abruptly. â€œThe young black man who was with me?â€

â€œWas there?â€ Bonnet looked quizzical. â€œIf they brought him aboard, I imagine theyâ€™ve put him in the hold with the other cargo. A bonus, I suppose,â€ he added, and laughed.

Her fury at Forbes had been tinged with relief at finding out he was the motive behind her abduction; Forbes might be a low-down, sneaking scoundrel, but he wouldnâ€™t be intending to murder her. That laugh of Stephen Bonnetâ€™s, though, made a cold qualm run through her, and she felt suddenly light-headed.

â€œWhat do you mean, a bonus?â€

Bonnet scratched his cheek, gooseberry eyes roaming over her in approval.

â€œOh, well, then. Mr. Forbes only wanted ye out of the way, he said. Whatever did ye do to the man, darlinâ€™? But heâ€™s paid your fare already, and Iâ€™ve the impression that heâ€™s no great interest in where ye end up.â€

â€œWhere I end up?â€ Her mouth had been dry; now saliva was pouring from her membranes, and she had to swallow repeatedly.

â€œWell, after all, darlinâ€™, why bother takinâ€™ ye all the way to London, where yeâ€™d be of no particular use to anyone? Besides, it rains quite a bit in London; Iâ€™m sure ye wouldnâ€™t like it.â€

Before she could draw breath to ask any more questions, the door opened, and a young woman slid through, closing it behind her.

She was likely in her twenties, though with a missing molar that showed when she smiled. She was plump and plain-faced, brown-haired, and clean by local standards, though the scent of her sweat and waves of freshly applied cheap cologne wafted across the cabin, making Brianna want to throw up again.

â€œHallo, Stephen,â€ the newcomer said, standing on tiptoe to kiss Bonnetâ€™s cheek. â€œGive us a drink to be starting with, eh?â€

Bonnet grabbed her, gave her a deep and lingering kiss, then let her go and reached for the bottle.

Coming down onto her heels, she looked at Brianna with detached professional interest, then back at Bonnet, and scratched at her neck.

â€œYouâ€™ll have the two of us, Stephen, or shall it be me and her to start? Itâ€™s a quid more, either way.â€

Bonnet didnâ€™t bother answering, but thrust the bottle into her hand, whipped off the kerchief that hid the swell of her heavy breasts, and began at once to undo his flies. He dropped the breeches on the floor, and without ado, seized the woman by the hips and pressed her against the door.

Guzzling from the bottle she held in one hand, the young woman snatched up her skirts with the other, whisking skirt and petticoat out of the way with a practiced motion that bared her to the waist. Brianna caught a glimpse of sturdy thighs and a patch of dark hair, before they were obscured by Bonnetâ€™s buttocks, blond-furred and clenched with effort.

She turned her head away, cheeks burning, but morbid fascination compelled her to glance back. The whore was standing balanced on her toes, squatting slightly to accommodate him, gazing placidly over his shoulder as he thrust and grunted. One hand still held the bottle; the other stroked Bonnetâ€™s shoulders in a practiced way. She caught Briannaâ€™s eye on her, and winked, still saying, â€œOoh, yes . . . oh, YES! Thatâ€™s good, love, so good . . .â€ in her clientâ€™s ear.

The cabin door quivered with each meaty thump of the whoreâ€™s backside, and Brianna could hear laughter in the corridor outside, both male and female; evidently Orden had brought back enough to supply crew as well as captain.

Bonnet heaved and grunted for a minute or two, then gave a loud groan, his movements suddenly jerky and uncoordinated. The whore put a helpful hand on his buttocks and pulled him close, then relaxed her grip as his body went limp, leaning heavily against her. She supported him for a moment, patting his back matter-of-factly, like a mother burping a baby, then pushed him off.

His face and neck were flushed dark red, and he was breathing heavily. He nodded to the whore, and stooped, fumbling for his breeches. He stood up with them and waved toward the littered desk.

â€œHelp yourself to your pay, darlinâ€™, but give me back the bottle, aye?â€

The whore pouted slightly, but took a final deep gulp of the liquor and handed him the bottle, now no more than a quarter full. She pulled a wadded cloth from the pocket at her waist and clapped it between her thighs, then shook down her skirts and minced across to the desk, poking delicately among the litter for scattered coins, which she picked out with two fingers, dropping them one by one into the depths of her pocket.

Bonnet, clothed once more, went out without a backward glance at the two women. The air in the cabin was hot and thick with the scent of sex, and Brianna felt her stomach clench. Not with revulsion, but with panic. The strong male reek had triggered an instinctive flush of response that tingled across her breasts and gripped her inwardly; for a brief, disorienting moment, she felt Rogerâ€™s skin, slick with sweat against her own, and her breasts tingled, swollen and wanting.

She pressed both lips and legs tight together, and curled her hands into fists, breathing shallowly. The last thing she could stand right now, she thoughtâ€”the very last thingâ€”was to think of Roger and sex, while anywhere within miles of Stephen Bonnet. She resolutely pushed the thought aside, and edged closer to the whore, searching for some remark with which to open conversation.

The whore sensed the movement, and glanced at Brianna, taking in both the torn dress and its quality, but then dismissed her in favor of finding more coins. Once she had her pay, the woman would leave, going back to the docks. It was a chance to get word to Roger and her parents. Not much, perhaps, but a chance.

â€œYou . . . um . . . know him well?â€ she said.

The whore glanced at her, eyebrows lifted.

â€œWho? Oh, Stephen? Aye, heâ€™s a good â€™un, Stephen.â€ She shrugged. â€œDonâ€™t take more than two or three minutes, no bones about the money, never wants nothinâ€™ but a simple swive. Heâ€™s rough now and then, but he donâ€™t hit unless you cross him, and no oneâ€™s fool enough to do that. Not more than once, anyroad.â€ Her gaze lingered for a moment on Briannaâ€™s torn dress, one brow lifting sardonically.

â€œIâ€™ll remember that,â€ Brianna said dryly, and pulled the edge of her ripped chemise up higher. She glimpsed a glass bottle amid the rubble on the desk, filled with a clear liquid, containing a small round object. She leaned closer to look at it, frowning. It couldnâ€™t be . . . but it was. A round, fleshy object, rather like a hard-boiled egg, a pinkish-gray in colorâ€”with a neat round hole drilled completely through it.

She crossed herself, feeling faint.

â€œI was that surprised,â€ the whore went on, eyeing Brianna with open curiosity. â€œHeâ€™s never had two girls together, so far as I know, and heâ€™s not one as wants someone to watch while heâ€™s at his pleasure.â€

â€œIâ€™m notâ€”â€ Brianna began, but then stopped, not wanting to offend the woman.

â€œNot a whore?â€ The young woman grinned broadly, exposing the black gap of her missing tooth. â€œI might haâ€™ guessed as much, chickie. Not as it would make no never mind to Stephen. He sows as he likes, and I can see as how he might like you. Most men would.â€ She looked at Brianna with dispassionate assessment, nodding at her disheveled hair, flushed face, and tidy figure.

â€œI expect they like you, too,â€ Brianna said politely, with a faint feeling of surreality. â€œEr . . . whatâ€™s your name?â€

â€œHepzibah,â€ the woman said with an air of pride. â€œOr Eppie, for short, like.â€ There were coins still on the desk, but the whore left them alone. Bonnet might be generous, but evidently the whore didnâ€™t want to take advantage of himâ€”more likely a sign of fear than of friendship, Brianna thought. She took a deep breath and pressed on.

â€œWhat a lovely name. Pleased to meet you, Eppie.â€ She held out a hand. â€œMy name is Brianna Fraser MacKenzie.â€ She gave all three names, hoping the whore would remember at least one of them.

The woman glanced at the extended hand in puzzlement, then gingerly shook it, dropping it like a dead fish. She pulled up her skirt, and began to clean herself with the rag, fastidiously wiping away all trace of the recent encounter.

Brianna leaned closer, bracing herself against the odors of the stained rag, the womanâ€™s body, and the hot smell of liquor on her breath.

â€œStephen Bonnet kidnapped me,â€ she said.

â€œOh, aye?â€ said the whore, indifferent. â€œWell, he takes as he likes, does Stephen.â€

â€œI want to get away,â€ Brianna said, keeping her voice low, with a glance at the cabin door. She could hear the sound of feet on the deck overhead, and hoped voices wouldnâ€™t carry through the heavy planks.

Eppie wadded up the rag and dropped it on the desk. She rummaged in her pocket, coming out with a small bottle stoppered with a plug of wax. She still held her skirts up, and Brianna could see the silvery streaks of stretch marks across her plump belly.

â€œWell, give him what he wants, then,â€ the whore advised, taking out the plug and pouring a bit of the bottleâ€™s contentsâ€”a surprisingly mild scent of rosewaterâ€”into her hand. â€œChances are heâ€™ll tire of ye in a few days and put ye ashore.â€ She wiped the rosewater lavishly over her pubic hair, then sniffed critically at her hand and made a face.

â€œNo. I mean, thatâ€™s not what he kidnapped me for. I donâ€™t think,â€ she added.

Eppie recorked the bottle, and dropped both it and the rag into her pocket.

â€œOh, he means to ransom you?â€ Eppie eyed her with a little more interest. â€œStill, Iâ€™ve never known scruples interfere with the manâ€™s appetite. Heâ€™d take a virginâ€™s maidenhead and sell her back to her father before her belly started swelling.â€ She pursed her lips, a belated thought coming to her.

â€œSo how did you talk him out of havinâ€™ you, then?â€

Brianna put a hand on her stomach.

â€œI told him I was pregnant. That stopped him. I wouldnâ€™t have thoughtâ€”a man like thatâ€”but it did. Perhaps heâ€™s better than you think?â€ she asked with a wisp of hope.

Eppie laughed at that, small eyes squeezing half-shut with hilarity at the thought.

â€œStephen? God, no!â€ She sniffed with amusement, and smoothed down her skirts.

â€œNo,â€ she went on, more matter-of-factly, â€œbest story you could tell, though, if you donâ€™t want him at you. He called me down to him once, then put me off when he saw Iâ€™d a cake in the ovenâ€”when I joked him about it, he said heâ€™d once taken a whore with her belly the size of a cannonball, and right in the midst of it, she give a groan and the blood come spurting out of her fit to drench the room. Put him right off, he said, and no wonder. Left our Stephen with a horror of swiving girls what are up the spout. Heâ€™s takinâ€™ no chances, see.â€

â€œI see.â€ A trickle of sweat ran down Briannaâ€™s cheek, and she wiped it away with the back of her hand. Her mouth felt dry, and she sucked the inside of her cheek for moisture. â€œThe womanâ€”what happened to her?â€

Hepzibah looked blank for a moment.

â€œOh, the whore? Why, she died, of course, poor cow. Stephen said as how he was struggling to get into his wet breeches, all soused with blood like they were, and he looked up and saw her layinâ€™ still as stone on the floor, but with her belly still wriggling and twitching like a bag full oâ€™ snakes. Said it come to him sudden that the babe meant to come out and take its revenge on him, and he fled the house right then in his shirt, leavinâ€™ his breeches behind.â€

She chortled at this amusing vision, then snorted and settled herself, brushing down her skirts. â€œBut then, Stephenâ€™s Irish,â€ she added tolerantly. â€œThey take morbid fancies, the Irish, especially when theyâ€™re gone in drink.â€ The tip of her tongue came out and passed reminiscently over her lower lip, tasting the lingering traces of Bonnetâ€™s liquor.

Brianna leaned closer, holding out her hand.

â€œLook.â€

Hepzibah glanced into her hand, then looked again, riveted. The thick gold band with its big cabochon ruby winked and glowed in the lantern light.

â€œIâ€™ll give it to you,â€ Brianna said, lowering her voice, â€œif youâ€™ll do something for me.â€

The whore licked her lips again, a sudden look of alertness coming into her heavy face.

â€œAye? Do what?â€

â€œGet word to my husband. Heâ€™s in Edenton, at the Reverend McMillanâ€™s houseâ€”anyone will know where it is. Tell him where I am, and tell himâ€”â€ She hesitated. What should she say? There was no telling how long the Anemone would stay here, or where Bonnet would choose to go next. The only clue she had was what she had overheard in his conversation with his mate, just before he came in.

â€œTell them I think he has a hiding place on Ocracoke. He means to rendezvous with someone there at the dark of the moon. Tell him that.â€

Hepzibah cast an uneasy glance at the cabin door, but it stayed shut. She looked back at the ring, longing for it warring in her face with an obvious fear of Bonnet.

â€œHe wonâ€™t know,â€ Brianna urged. â€œHe wonâ€™t find out. And my father will reward you.â€

â€œHeâ€™s a rich man, then, your father?â€ Brianna saw the look of calculation in the whoreâ€™s eyes, and felt a momentâ€™s misgivingâ€”what if she should simply take the ring and betray her to Bonnet? Still, she hadnâ€™t taken more money than her due; perhaps she was honest. And there was no choice, after all.

â€œVery rich,â€ she said firmly. â€œHis name is Jamie Fraser. My aunt is rich, too. She has a plantation called River Run, just above Cross Creek in North Carolina. Ask for Mrs. Innesâ€”Jocasta Cameron Innes. Yes, if you donâ€™t find Roâ€”my husband, send word there.â€

â€œRiver Run.â€ Hepzibah repeated it obediently, eyes still fixed on the ring.

Brianna twisted it off and dropped it into the whoreâ€™s palm before she could change her mind. The womanâ€™s hand closed tight around it.

â€œMy fatherâ€™s name is Jamie Fraser; my husband is Roger MacKenzie,â€ she repeated. â€œAt the Reverend McMillanâ€™s house. Can you remember?â€

â€œFraser and MacKenzie,â€ Hepzibah repeated uncertainly. â€œOh, aye, to be sure.â€ She was already moving toward the door.

â€œPlease,â€ Brianna said urgently.

The whore nodded but without looking at her, then sidled through the door, shutting it behind her.

The ship creaked and swayed underfoot, and she heard the rattle of wind through the trees on the shore, over the shouts of drunken men. Her knees gave way then and she sat down on the bed, careless of the sheets.



THEY LEFT WITH the tide; she heard the anchor chain rumble and felt the ship quicken, taking life as her sails took wind. Glued to the window, she watched the dark green mass of Roanoke recede. A hundred years before, the first English colony had landed hereâ€”and disappeared without trace. The governor of the colony, returning from England with supplies, had found everyone gone, leaving no clue save the word â€œCroatanâ€ carved into the trunk of a tree.

She wasnâ€™t even leaving that much. Heartsick, she watched until the island sank into the sea.

No one came for some hours. Empty-bellied, she grew nauseated, and threw up in the chamber pot. She could not bear the thought of lying down on those revolting sheets, but instead pulled them off, remade the bed with only the quilts, and lay down.

The windows were open, and the fresh air of the sea stirred her hair and lifted the clamminess from her skin, making her feel a little better. She was unbearably conscious of her womb, a small, heavy, tender weight, and what was likely happening inside it: that orderly dance of dividing cells, a sort of peaceful violence, implacably wresting lives and wrenching hearts.

When had it happened? She tried to think back, remember. It might have been the night before Roger left for Edenton. He had been excited, almost exalted, and they had made love with lingering joy, spiced by longing, for they both knew the morrow would bring separation. She had fallen asleep in his arms, feeling loved.

But then she had waked alone, in the middle of the night, to find him sitting by the window, bathed in the light of a gibbous moon. She had been reluctant to disturb his private contemplation, but he had turned, feeling her eyes on him, and something in his look had made her get out of bed and go to him, taking his head against her bosom, holding him.

He had risen then, laid her on the floor, and had her again, wordless and urgent.

Catholic that she was, she had found it terribly erotic, the notion of seducing a priest on the eve of his ordination, stealing himâ€”if only for a momentâ€”from God.

She swallowed, hands clasped over her belly. Be careful what you pray for. The nuns at school had always told the children that.

The wind was growing cold, chilling her, and she pulled the edge of one quiltâ€”the cleanestâ€”over her. Then, concentrating fiercely, she began very carefully to pray.

PUT TO THE QUESTION




NEIL FORBES sat in the parlor of the Kingâ€™s Inn, enjoying a glass of hard cider and the feeling that all was right with the world. He had had a most fruitful meeting with Samuel Iredell and his friend, two of the most prominent rebel leaders in Edentonâ€”and an even more fruitful meeting with Gilbert Butler and William Lyons, local smugglers.

He had a great fondness for jewels, and in private celebration of his elegant disposal of the threat of Jamie Fraser, he had bought a new stickpin, topped with a beautiful ruby. He contemplated this with quiet satisfaction, noting the lovely shadows that the stone cast on the silk of his ruffle.

His mother was safely planted at her sisterâ€™s house, he had an appointment for luncheon with a local lady, and an hour to spare beforehand. Perhaps a stroll to stimulate appetite; it was a beautiful day.

He had in fact pushed back his chair and begun to rise when a large hand planted itself in the center of his chest and shoved him back into it.

â€œWhatâ€”?â€ He looked up in indignationâ€”and took great care to keep that expression on his face, despite a sudden deep qualm. A tall, dark man was standing over him, wearing a most unfriendly expression. MacKenzie, the chitâ€™s husband.

â€œHow dare you, sir?â€ he said, belligerent. â€œI must demand apology!â€

â€œYou demand what ye like,â€ MacKenzie said. He was pale under his tan, and grim. â€œWhere is my wife?â€

â€œHow should I know?â€ Forbesâ€™s heart was beating fast, but with glee as much as trepidation. He lifted his chin and made to rise. â€œYou will excuse me, sir.â€

A hand on his arm stopped him, and he turned, looking into the face of Fraserâ€™s nephew, Ian Murray. Murray smiled, and Forbesâ€™s sense of self-satisfaction diminished slightly. They said the boy had lived with the Mohawk, become one of themâ€”that he dwelt with a vicious wolf who spoke to him and obeyed his commands, that he had cut a manâ€™s heart out and eaten it in some heathen ritual.

Looking at the ladâ€™s homely face and disheveled dress, though, Forbes was not impressed.

â€œRemove your hand from my person, sir,â€ he said with dignity, straightening in his chair.

â€œNo, I think I wonâ€™t,â€ Murray said. The hand tightened on his arm like the bite of a horse, and Forbesâ€™s mouth opened, though he made no sound.

â€œWhat have ye done with my cousin?â€ Murray said.

â€œI? Why, Iâ€”I have nothing whatever to do with Mrs. MacKenzie. Let go, God damn you!â€

The grip relaxed, and he sat breathing heavily. MacKenzie had pulled up a chair to face him and sat down.

Forbes smoothed the sleeve of his coat, avoiding MacKenzieâ€™s stare and thinking rapidly. How had they found out? Or had they? Perhaps they were only trying a venture, with no sure knowledge.

â€œI am grieved to hear that any misfortune might have befallen Mrs. MacKenzie,â€ he said politely. â€œAm I to take it that you have somehow misplaced her?â€

MacKenzie looked him up and down for a moment without answering, then made a small sound of contempt.

â€œI heard ye speak in Mecklenberg,â€ he said, his tone conversational. â€œVery glib ye were. A great deal about justice, I heard, and protection of our wives and children. Such eloquence.â€

â€œFine talk,â€ Ian Murray put in, â€œfor a man who would abduct a helpless woman.â€ He was still crouching on the floor like a savage, but had moved round a little, so as to stare directly into Forbesâ€™s face. The lawyer found it slightly unnerving, and chose instead to meet MacKenzieâ€™s eyes, man to man.

â€œI regret your misfortune extremely, sir,â€ he said, striving for a tone of concern. â€œI should be pleased to help, in any way possible, of course. But I do notâ€”â€

â€œWhere is Stephen Bonnet?â€

The question struck Forbes like a blow to the liver. He gaped for a moment, thinking that he had made a mistake in choosing MacKenzie to look at; that flat green gaze was like a snakeâ€™s.

â€œWho is Stephen Bonnet?â€ he asked, licking his lips. His lips were dry, but the rest of him was heavily bedewed; he could feel sweat pooling in the creases of his neck, soaking the cambric of his shirt beneath his oxters.

â€œI heard ye, ken,â€ Murray remarked pleasantly. â€œWhen ye made the bargain wiâ€™ Richard Brown. In your warehouse, it was.â€

Forbesâ€™s head snapped round. He was so shocked that it was a moment before he realized that Murray was holding a knife, laid casually across his knee.

â€œWhat? You sayâ€”what? I tell you, sir, you are mistakenâ€”mistaken!â€ He half-rose, stammering. MacKenzie shot to his feet and seized him by the shirtfront, twisting.

â€œNo, sir,â€ he said very softly, his face so close that Forbes felt the heat of his breath. â€œIt is yourself has been mistaken. Most grievously mistaken, in choosing my wife to serve your wicked ends.â€

There was a ripping sound as the fine cambric tore. MacKenzie shoved him back violently into the chair, then leaned forward, seizing his neckcloth in a grip that threatened to choke him on the spot. His mouth opened, gasping, and black spots flickered in his visionâ€”but not sufficiently as to obscure those brilliant, cold green eyes.

â€œWhere has he taken her?â€

Forbes gripped the arms of his chair, breathing heavily.

â€œI know nothing about your wife,â€ he said, his voice pitched low and venomous. â€œAnd as for grievous error, sir, you are in the process of committing one. How dare you assault me? I shall prefer charges, I do assure you!â€

â€œOh, assault, forbye,â€ Murray said, scoffing. â€œWe havena done any such thing. Yet.â€ He sat back on his haunches, tapping the knife thoughtfully against his thumbnail and regarding Forbes with an air of estimation, like one planning to carve a suckling pig on a platter.

Forbes set his jaw and glared up at MacKenzie, who was still standing, looming over him.

â€œThis is a public place,â€ he pointed out. â€œYou cannot harm me without notice being taken.â€ He glanced behind MacKenzie, hoping that someone would come into the parlor and interrupt this grossly uncomfortable tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, but it was a quiet morning, and all the chambermaids and ostlers inconveniently about their duties elsewhere.

â€œDo we care if anyone notices, a charaid?â€ Murray inquired, glancing up at MacKenzie.

â€œNot really.â€ Nonetheless, MacKenzie resumed his seat and resumed his stare. â€œWe can wait a bit, though.â€ He glanced at the case clock by the mantel, its pendulum moving with a serene tick-tock. â€œIt wonâ€™t be long.â€

Belatedly, it occurred to Forbes to wonder where Jamie Fraser was.



ELSPETH FORBES was rocking gently on the veranda of her sisterâ€™s house, enjoying the coolness of the morning air, when a visitor was announced.

â€œWhy, Mr. Fraser!â€ she exclaimed, sitting up. â€œWhat brings ye to Edenton? Is it Neil yeâ€™re in search of? Heâ€™s gone toâ€”â€

â€œAh, no, Mistress Forbes.â€ He swept her a low bow, the morning sun gleaming off his hair as though it were bronze metal. â€œIt is yourself Iâ€™ve come for.â€

â€œOh? Oh!â€ She sat up in her chair, hastily brushing away crumbs of toast on her sleeve, and hoping her cap was on straight. â€œWhy, sir, what could ye possibly want with an old woman?â€

He smiledâ€”such a nice-looking lad he was, so fine in his gray coatie, and that look of mischief in his eyesâ€”and leaned close to whisper in her ear.

â€œIâ€™ve come to steal ye away, Mistress.â€

â€œOch, awaâ€™ with ye!â€ She flapped a hand at him, laughing, and he took it, kissing her knuckles.

â€œI shallna take â€˜noâ€™ for answer, now,â€ he assured her, and gestured toward the edge of the porch, where he had left a large, promising-looking basket, covered with a checkered cloth. â€œIâ€™ve a mind to eat my luncheon in the country, under a tree. Iâ€™ve the very tree in mindâ€”a braw, fine treeâ€”but itâ€™s a poor meal, taken without company.â€

â€œSurely to goodness ye could find better company than mine, lad,â€ she said, thoroughly charmed. â€œAnd whereâ€™s your dear wife, then?â€

â€œAh, sheâ€™s left me,â€ he said, affecting sorrow. â€œHereâ€™s me, with a wonderful picnic planned, and her off to a birthing. So I said to myself, well, Jamie, itâ€™s shame to waste such a feastâ€”who might be at liberty to share it with ye? And what should I see next but your most elegant self, taking your ease. An answer to prayer, it was; surely ye wouldna go against heavenly guidance, Mistress Forbes?â€

â€œHmph,â€ she said, trying not to laugh at him. â€œOch, well. If itâ€™s a matter of wasting . . .â€

Before she could say more, he had stooped down and plucked her from her chair, lifting her in his arms. She whooped with surprise.

â€œIf itâ€™s a proper abduction, I must carry ye away, aye?â€ he said, smiling down at her.

To her mortification, the sound she made could be called nothing but a giggle. He seemed not to mind, though, and bending to sweep up the basket in one strong hand, carried her like a bit of thistledown out to his carriage.



â€œYOU CANNOT KEEP ME prisoner here! Let me pass, or I will shout for help!â€

They had, in fact, held him for more than an hour, blocking all attempts on his part to rise and leave. He was right, though, Roger thought; traffic was beginning to pick up in the street outside, and he could hearâ€”as could Forbesâ€”the noises of a maid setting out the tables for dinner in the next room.

He glanced at Ian. They had discussed it; if word hadnâ€™t come within an hour, they would have to try to remove Forbes from the inn, take him to a more private place. That could be a dicey business; the lawyer was intimidated, but stubborn as a ball bearing. And he would call for help.

Ian pursed his lips thoughtfully, and drew the knife he had been playing with down the side of his breeches, polishing the blade.

â€œMr. MacKenzie?â€ A small boy had popped up beside him like a mushroom, dirt-smeared and round-faced.

â€œI am,â€ he said, a wave of thankfulness washing through him. â€œHave ye got something for me?â€

â€œAye, sir.â€ The urchin handed over a small twist of paper, accepted a coin in return, and was gone, in spite of Forbesâ€™s call of â€œWait, boy!â€

The lawyer had half-risen from his seat in agitation. Roger made a sharp move toward him, though, and he sank back at once, not waiting to be pushed. Good, Roger thought grimly, he was learning.

Undoing the twist of paper, he found himself holding a large brooch in the shape of a bunch of flowers, done in garnets and silver. It was a good piece of workmanship, but rather ugly. Its impression on Forbes, though, was substantial.

â€œYou wouldnâ€™t. He wouldnâ€™t.â€ The lawyer was staring at the brooch in Rogerâ€™s hand, his heavy face gone pale.

â€œOh, I expect he would, if ye mean Uncle Jamie,â€ Ian Murray said. â€œHeâ€™s fond of his daughter, aye?â€

â€œNonsense.â€ The lawyer was making a game attempt to bluff it out, but he couldnâ€™t keep his eyes off the brooch. â€œFraser is a gentleman.â€

â€œHeâ€™s a Highlander,â€ Roger said brutally. â€œLike your father, aye?â€ Heâ€™d heard stories about the elder Forbes, who by all accounts had escaped Scotland just ahead of the hangsman.

Forbes chewed his lower lip.

â€œHe would not harm an old woman,â€ he said, with as much bravado as he could summon.

â€œWould he not?â€ Ianâ€™s sketchy brows lifted. â€œAye, perhaps not. He might just send her awaâ€™, thoughâ€”to Canada, maybe? Ye seem to ken him fair weel, Mr. Forbes. What dâ€™ye think?â€

The lawyer drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair, breathing through his teeth, evidently reviewing what he knew of Jamie Fraserâ€™s character and reputation.

â€œAll right,â€ he said suddenly. â€œAll right!â€

Roger felt the tension running through him snap like a cut wire. Heâ€™d been strung like a puppet since Jamie had come to fetch him last night.

â€œWhere?â€ he said, feeling breathless. â€œWhere is she?â€

â€œSheâ€™s safe,â€ Forbes said hoarsely. â€œI wouldnâ€™t have her harmed.â€ He looked up, wild-eyed. â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, I wouldnâ€™t harm her!â€

â€œWhere?â€ Roger clamped the brooch tight, not caring that its edges cut into his hand. â€œWhere is she?â€

The lawyer sagged like a half-filled bag of meal.

â€œAboard a ship called Anemone, Captain Bonnet.â€ He swallowed hard, unable to keep his eyes away from the brooch. â€œSheâ€”I toldâ€”they are bound for England. But she is safe, I tell you!â€

Shock tightened Rogerâ€™s grip, and he felt the sudden slick of blood on his fingers. He flung the brooch onto the floor, wiping his hand on his breeches, struggling for words. The shock had tightened his throat, as well; he felt as though he were strangling.

Seeing his trouble, Ian stood abruptly and pressed his knife against the lawyerâ€™s throat.

â€œWhen did they sail?â€

â€œIâ€”Iâ€”â€ The lawyerâ€™s mouth opened and closed at random, and he looked helplessly from Ian to Roger, eyes bulging.

â€œWhere?â€ Roger forced the word past the blockage in his throat, and Forbes flinched at the sound.

â€œSheâ€”she was put aboard here. In Edenton. Twoâ€”two days ago.â€

Roger nodded abruptly. Safe, he said. In Bonnetâ€™s hands. Two days, in Bonnetâ€™s hands. But he had sailed with Bonnet, he thought, trying to steady himself, keep a grip on his rationality. He knew how the man worked. Bonnet was a smuggler; he would not sail for England without a full cargo. He mightâ€”mightâ€”be going down the coast, picking up small shipments before turning to the open sea and the long voyage for England.

And if notâ€”he might still be caught, with a fast ship.

No time to be lost; people on the docks might know where the Anemone was headed next. He turned and took a step toward the door. Then a red wave washed through him and he whirled back, smashing his fist into Forbesâ€™s face with the full weight of his body behind it.

The lawyer gave a high-pitched scream, and clutched both hands to his nose. All noises in the inn and in the street seemed to stop; the world hung suspended. Roger took a short, deep breath, rubbing his knuckles, and nodded once more.

â€œCome on,â€ he said to Ian.

â€œOh, aye.â€

Roger was halfway to the door when he realized that Ian was not with him. He looked back, and was just in time to see his cousin-by-marriage take Forbes gently by one ear and cut it off.

SLEEPING WITH A SHARK




STEPHEN BONNET was as good as his wordâ€”if thatâ€™s how one would describe it. He made no sexual advances toward her, but did insist that she share his bed.

â€œI like a warm body in the night,â€ he said. â€œAnd I think ye might prefer my bed to the cargo hold, sweetheart.â€

She would most emphatically have preferred the cargo hold, though her explorationsâ€”once free of land, she was allowed out of the cabinâ€”had revealed the hold as a dark and comfortless hole, in which several hapless slaves were chained among a collection of boxes and barrels, in constant danger of being crushed should the cargo shift.

â€œWhere are we going, miss? And what will happen when we get there?â€ Josh spoke in Gaelic, his handsome face small and frightened in the shadows of the hold.

â€œI think weâ€™re going to Ocracoke,â€ she said in the same language. â€œBeyond thatâ€”I donâ€™t know. Do you still have your rosary?â€

â€œOh, yes, miss.â€ He touched his chest, where the crucifix hung. â€œItâ€™s the only thing that keeps me from despair.â€

â€œGood. Keep praying.â€ She glanced at the other slaves: two women, two men, all with slender bodies and delicate, fine-boned faces. She had brought food for Josh from her own supper, but had nothing to offer them, and was troubled.

â€œDo they feed you down here?â€

â€œYes, miss. Fairly well,â€ he assured her.

â€œDo theyâ€â€”she moved her chin a little, delicately indicating the other slavesâ€”â€œknow anything? About where weâ€™re going?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know, miss. I canâ€™t talk to them. Theyâ€™re Africanâ€”Fulani, I can see that from the way they look, but thatâ€™s all I know.â€

â€œI see. Well . . .â€ She hesitated, eager to be out of the dark, clammy hold, but reluctant to leave the young groom there.

â€œYou go along, miss,â€ he said quietly in English, seeing her doubt. â€œI be fine. We all be fine.â€ He touched his rosary, and did his best to give her a smile, though it wavered round the edges. â€œHoly Mother see us safe.â€

Having no words of comfort to impart, she nodded, and climbed the ladder into the sunlight, feeling five sets of eyes upon her.

Bonnet, thank God, spent most of his time on deck during the day. She could see him now, coming down the rigging like a nimble ape.

She stood very still, no movement save the brush of windblown hair, of skirts against her frozen limbs. He was as sensitive to the movements of her body as was Rogerâ€”but in his own way. The way of a shark, signaled to and drawn by the flappings of its prey.

She had spent one night in his bed so far, sleepless. He had pulled her casually against himself, said, â€œGood night, darlinâ€™,â€ and fallen instantly asleep. Whenever she had tried to move, to extricate herself from his grip, though, he had shifted, moving with her, to keep her firmly by him.

She was obliged to an unwelcome intimacy with his body, an acquaintance that awoke memories she had with great difficulty put awayâ€”the feel of his knee pushing her thighs apart, the rough joviality of his touch between her legs, the sun-bleached blond hairs that curled crisply on his thighs and forearms, the unwashed, musky male smell of him. The mocking presence of LeRoi, rising at intervals during the night, pressed in firm and mindless hunger against her buttocks.

She had a moment of intense thankfulness, both for her present pregnancyâ€”for she was in no doubt of it nowâ€”and for her certain knowledge that Stephen Bonnet had not fathered Jemmy.

He dropped from the rigging with a thud, saw her, and smiled. He said nothing, but squeezed her bottom familiarly as he passed, making her clench her teeth and cling to the rail.

Ocracoke, at the dark of the moon. She looked up into the brilliant sky, wheeling with clouds of terns and gulls; they could not be far offshore. How long, for Godâ€™s sake, â€™til the dark of the moon?

THE PRODIGAL




THEY HAD NO TROUBLE IN FINDING persons familiar with Anemone and her captain. Stephen Bonnet was well-known on the Edenton docks, though his reputation varied, depending on his associations. An honest captain was the usual opinion, but hard in his dealings. A blockade runner, a smuggler, said othersâ€”and whether that was good or bad depended on the politics of the person saying it. Heâ€™d get you anything, they saidâ€”for a price.

Pirate, said a few. But those few spoke in low tones, looking frequently over their shoulders, and strongly desired not to be quoted.

The Anemone had left quite openly, with a homely cargo of rice and fifty barrels of smoked fish. Roger had found one man who recalled seeing the young woman go aboard with one of Bonnetâ€™s hands: â€œGreat huge doxy, with flaming hair a-loose, flowing down to her arse,â€ the man had said, smacking his lips. â€œMr. Bonnetâ€™s a good-size man himself, though; expect he can handle her.â€

Only Ianâ€™s hand on his arm had stopped him hitting the man.

What they had not yet found was anyone who knew for sure where Anemone was headed.

â€œLondon, I think,â€ said the harbormaster, dubious. â€œBut not directly; heâ€™s not yet got a full cargo. Likely heâ€™ll be going down the coast, trading here and thereâ€”perhaps sail for Europe from Charlestown. But then again,â€ the man added, rubbing his chin, â€œcould be heâ€™s bound for New England. Terrible risky business, getting anything into Boston these daysâ€”but well worth it if you do. Rice and smoked fish like to be worth their weight in gold up there, if you can get it ashore without the navyâ€™s warships blowing you out of the water.â€

Jamie, looking a little pale, thanked the man. Roger, unable to speak for the knot in his throat, merely nodded, and followed his father-in-law out of the harbormasterâ€™s office, back into the sun of the docks.

â€œNow what?â€ Ian asked, stifling a belch. He had been trawling through the dockside taverns, buying beer for casual laborers who might have helped load Anemone, or who might have spoken with her hands regarding her destination.

â€œThe best I can think of is maybe for you and Roger Mac to take ship down the coast,â€ Jamie said, frowning at the masts of the sloops and packet boats rocking at anchor. â€œClaire and I could go up, toward Boston.â€

Roger nodded, still unable to speak. It was far from being a good plan, particularly in light of the disruption the undeclared war was having on shippingâ€”but the need of doing something was acute. He felt as though the marrow of his bones was burning; only movement would quench it.

To hire a small shipâ€”even a fishing smackâ€”or take passage on a packet boat, though, was expensive business.

â€œAye, well.â€ Jamie curled his hand in his pocket, where the black diamond still lay. â€œIâ€™ll go and see Judge Iredell; he can maybe put me in touch with an honest banker whoâ€™ll advance me money against the sale of the stone. Letâ€™s go and tell Claire whatâ€™s to do, first.â€

As they turned off the docks, though, a voice hailed Roger.

â€œMr. MacKenzie!â€

He turned, to find the Reverend Doctor McCorkle, his secretary, and the Reverend McMillan, carrying bags, all staring at him.

There was a brief scuffle of introductionâ€”they had of course met Jamie when he came to fetch Roger, but not Ianâ€”and then a slightly awkward pause.

â€œYouâ€”â€ Roger cleared his throat, addressing the elder. â€œYou are leaving, then, sir? For the Indies?â€

McCorkle nodded, his large, kindly face set in concern.

â€œI am, sir. I regret so much that I must goâ€”and that you were not able toâ€”well.â€ Both McCorkle and the Reverend McMillan had tried to persuade him to return to them the day before, to take his place at the service of ordination. But he could not. Could not spare hours to such a thing, could not possibly engage himself to undertake the commitment with anything less than a single mindâ€”and while his mind was in fact single just now, it was not toward God. There was room in his heart just now for only one thingâ€”Brianna.

â€œWell, doubtless it is Godâ€™s will,â€ McCorkle said with a sigh. â€œYour wife, Mr. MacKenzie? There is no word of her?â€

He shook his head, and muttered acknowledgment of their concern, their promises to pray for him and for the safe return of his wife.He was too much worried to find this much solace, yet still, he was touched by their kindness, and parted from them with many good wishes in both directions.

Roger, Jamie, and Ian walked silently back toward the inn where they had left Claire.

â€œJust by way of curiosity, Ian, what did ye do with Forbesâ€™s ear?â€ Jamie asked, breaking the silence as they turned into the wide street where the inn was.

â€œOh, I have it safe, Uncle,â€ Ian assured him, patting the small leather pouch at his belt.

â€œWhat in the name of Gâ€”â€ Roger stopped abruptly, then resumed. â€œWhat dâ€™ye mean to do with it?â€

â€œKeep it with me until we find my cousin,â€ Ian said, seeming surprised that this was not obvious. â€œIt will help.â€

â€œIt will?â€

Ian nodded, serious.

â€œWhen ye set about a difficult questâ€”if yeâ€™re Kahnyenâ€™kehaka, I meanâ€”ye generally go aside for a time, to fast and pray for guidance. We havena time to be doing that now, of course. But often, while yeâ€™re doing that, ye choose a talismanâ€”or to be right about it, it chooses youâ€”â€ He sounded completely matter-of-fact about this procedure, Roger noted.

â€œAnd ye carry it with ye through the quest, to keep the attention of the spirits upon your desire and ensure your success.â€

â€œI see.â€ Jamie rubbed the bridge of his nose. He appearedâ€”like Rogerâ€”to be wondering what the Mohawk spirits might make of Neil Forbesâ€™s ear. It would, probably, ensure their attention, at least. â€œThe ear . . . did ye pack it in salt, I hope?â€

Ian shook his head.

â€œNay, I smoked it over the kitchen fire at the inn last night. Dinna fash yourself, Uncle Jamie; it will keep.â€

Roger found a perverse sort of comfort in this conversation. Between the prayers of the Presbyterian clergy and the support of the Mohawk spirits, perhaps they had a chanceâ€”but it was the presence of his two kinsmen, stalwart and determined on either side of him, that kept him in hope. They would not give up until Brianna was found, no matter what it took.

He swallowed the lump in his throat for the thousandth time since hearing the news, thinking of Jemmy. The little boy was safe at River Runâ€”but how could he tell Jem that his mother was gone? Well . . . he wouldnâ€™t, that was all. Theyâ€™d find her.

In this mood of resolution, he led the way through the door of the Brewster, only to be hailed again.

â€œRoger!â€

This time, it was Claireâ€™s voice, sharp with excitement. He turned at once, to see her rising from a bench in the taproom. Seated across the table from her were a plump young woman and a slightly built young man with a cap of tightly curled black hair. Manfred McGillivray.



â€œI SAW YE BEFORE, sir, two days ago.â€ Manfred bobbed his head apologetically toward Jamie. â€œI . . . er . . . well, I hid myself, sir, and I do regret it. But of course, Iâ€™d no way of knowing, until Eppie came back from Roanoke and showed me the ring. . . .â€

The ring lay on the table, its cabochon ruby casting a tiny, calm pool of ruddy light on the boards. Roger picked it up and turned it in his fingers. He barely heard the explanationsâ€”that Manfred lived with the whore, who made periodic expeditions to the ports near Edenton, and upon seeing the ring had overcome his sense of shame and come to find Jamieâ€”too much overcome by this small, hard, tangible evidence of Brianna.

Roger closed his fingers over it, finding the warmth of it a comfort, and came to himself in time to hear Hepzibah say earnestly, â€œOcracoke, sir. At the dark of the moon.â€ She coughed modestly, ducking her head. â€œThe lady did say, sir, as you might feel some gratitude for the news of her whereabouts. . . .â€

â€œYeâ€™ll be paid, and paid well,â€ Jamie assured her, though he was clearly giving her no more than a fraction of his attention. â€œThe dark of the moon,â€ he said, turning to Ian. â€œTen days?â€

Ian nodded, his face shining with excitement.

â€œAye, about that. She didna ken whereabouts on Ocracoke Island this was?â€ he asked the whore.

Eppie shook her head.

â€œNay, sir. I ken Stephenâ€™s got a house there, a large one, hidden in the trees, but thatâ€™s all.â€

â€œWeâ€™ll find it.â€ Rogerâ€™s own voice surprised him; he hadnâ€™t meant to speak aloud.

Manfred had been looking uneasy throughout. He leaned forward, putting his hand on top of Eppieâ€™s.

â€œSirâ€”when ye do find it . . . yeâ€™ll not say to anybody, will ye, about Eppie telling ye? Mr. Bonnetâ€™s a dangerous man, and I wouldna have her imperiled from him.â€ He glanced at the young woman, who blushed and smiled at him.

â€œNo, we wonâ€™t say anything about her,â€ Claire assured him. She had been scrutinizing both Manfred and Hepzibah carefully while they talked, and now leaned across the table to touch Manfredâ€™s forehead, which showed a stippling of some sort of rash. â€œSpeaking of peril . . . sheâ€™s in a great deal more danger from you, young man, than from Stephen Bonnet. Did you tell her?â€

Manfred went a little paler, and for the first time, Roger noticed that the young man looked truly ill, his face thin and deeply lined.

â€œI did, Frau Fraser. From the first.â€

â€œOh, about the pox?â€ Hepzibah affected nonchalance, though Roger could see her hand tighten on Manfredâ€™s. â€œAye, he did tell me. But I says to him as it makes no difference. I daresay Iâ€™ve had a few men what are poxed before, not knowing. If I should get it . . . well. Godâ€™s will, innit?â€

â€œNo,â€ Roger said to her quite gently. â€œIt isnâ€™t. But youâ€™ll go with Mrs. Claire, you and Manfred both, and do exactly what she tells you. Yeâ€™ll be all right, and so will he. Wonâ€™t they?â€ he asked, turning to Claire, suddenly a little uncertain.

â€œYes, they will,â€ she said dryly. â€œFortunately, I have quite a bit of penicillin with me.â€

Manfredâ€™s face was a study in confusion.

â€œButâ€”do ye mean, meine Frau, that ye canâ€”can cure it?â€

â€œThat is exactly what I mean,â€ Claire assured him, â€œas I tried to tell you before you ran away.â€

His mouth hung open, and he blinked. Then he turned to Hepzibah, who was staring at him in puzzlement.

â€œLiebchen! I can go home! We can go home,â€ he amended quickly, seeing her face change. â€œWe will be married. We will go home,â€ he repeated, in the tones of one seeing a beatific vision but not quite trusting in its reality yet.

Eppie was frowning in uncertainty.

â€œIâ€™m a whore, Freddie,â€ she pointed out. â€œAnd from the stories you tell about your mother . . .â€

â€œI rather think that Frau Ute will be so happy to have Manfred back that she wonâ€™t be disposed to ask too many questions,â€ Claire said, with a glance at Jamie. â€œThe Prodigal Son, you know?â€

â€œYe wonâ€™t need to be a whore any longer,â€ Manfred assured her. â€œIâ€™m a gunsmith; Iâ€™ll earn a good living. Now that I know I shall be living!â€ His thin face was suddenly suffused with joy, and he flung his arms around Eppie and kissed her.

â€œOh,â€ she said, flustered, but looking pleased. â€œWell. Hm. This . . . er . . . this pennyâ€”?â€ She looked inquiringly at Claire.

â€œThe sooner, the better,â€ Claire said, standing up. â€œCome with me.â€ Her own face was a little flushed, Roger saw, and she put out a quick hand to Jamie, who took it and pressed it hard.

â€œWeâ€™ll go and see to things,â€ he said, glancing at Ian and Roger in turn. â€œWith luck, weâ€™ll sail this evening.â€

â€œOh!â€ Eppie had already stood up to follow Claire, but at this reminder of their business, she turned to Jamie, a hand to her mouth. â€œOh. Iâ€™ve thought of the one more thing.â€ Her pleasant round face was puckered in concentration. â€œThere are wild horses that run near the house. On Ocracoke. I heard Stephen speak oâ€™ them once.â€ She looked from one man to the other. â€œMight that help?â€

â€œIt might,â€ Roger said. â€œThank youâ€”and God bless you.â€

It wasnâ€™t until they were outside, heading for the docks again, that he realized the ring was still clutched tight in his hand. What was it Ian had said?

â€œYe choose a talismanâ€”or to be right about it, it chooses you.â€

His hands were slightly bigger than Briannaâ€™s, but he pushed the ring onto his finger, and closed his hand around it.



SHE WOKE FROM a damp and restless sleep, mother-sense at once aroused. She was halfway out of bed, moving by instinct toward Jemmyâ€™s trundle, when a hand grabbed her wrist, a convulsive grip like the bite of a crocodile.

She jerked back, groggy and alarmed. The sound of footsteps came to her from the deck overhead and she realized belatedly that the sound of distress that had wakened her had not come from Jemmy, but from the darkness at her side.

â€œDonâ€™t go,â€ he whispered, and the fingers dug deep into the soft flesh of her inner wrist.

Unable to wrench free, she reached out with the other hand, to push him away. She touched damp hair, hot skinâ€”and a trickle of wetness, cool and surprising on her fingers.

â€œWhat is it?â€ she whispered back, and leaned toward him by instinct. She reached again, touched his head, smoothed his hairâ€”all the things she had waked prepared to do. She felt her hand rest on him and thought to stop, but did not. It was as though the spurt of maternal comfort, once called forth, could not be pressed back into her, no more than the spurt of breast milk summoned by an infantâ€™s cry could be recalled to its source.

â€œAre you all right?â€ She kept her voice low, and as impersonal as the words allowed. She lifted her hand, and he moved, rolling toward her, pressing his head hard against the curve of her thigh.

â€œDonâ€™t go,â€ he said again, and caught his breath in what might have been a sob. His voice was low and rough, but not as she had ever heard it before.

â€œIâ€™m here.â€ Her trapped wrist was growing numb. She laid her free hand on his shoulder, hoping he would let go if she seemed willing to stay.

He did relax his grip, but only to reach out and seize her by the waist, pulling her back into bed. She went, because there was no choice, and lay in silence, Bonnetâ€™s breathing harsh and warm on the back of her neck.

At length, he let go and rolled onto his back with a sigh, allowing her to move. She rolled onto her own back, cautious, trying to keep a few inches between them. Moonlight came through the stern windows in a silver flood, and she could see the silhouette of his face, catch the glint of light from forehead and cheek as he turned his head.

â€œBad dream?â€ she ventured. Sheâ€™d meant to sound sarcastic, but her own heart was still tripping fast from the alarm of the awakening, and the words had a tentative sound.

â€œAye, aye,â€ he said with a shuddering sigh. â€œThe same. It comes to me over and over again, see? Yeâ€™d think Iâ€™d know what it was about and wake, but I never do. Not â€™til the waters close over my head.â€ He rubbed a hand under his nose, sniffing like a child.

â€œOh.â€ She didnâ€™t want to ask for details, didnâ€™t want to encourage any further sense of intimacy. What she wanted, though, had nothing much to do with things anymore.

â€œSince I was a lad, Iâ€™ve dreamed of drowning,â€ he said, and his voice, normally so assured, was unsteady. â€œThe sea comes in, and I cannot moveâ€”not at all. The tideâ€™s risinâ€™, and I know it will kill me, but thereâ€™s no way to move.â€ His hand clutched the sheet convulsively, pulling it away from her.

â€œItâ€™s gray water, full of mud, and there are blind things swimminâ€™ in it. Theyâ€™re waitinâ€™ on the sea to finish its business witâ€™ me, seeâ€”and then theyâ€™ve business of their own.â€

She could hear the horror of it in his voice, and was torn between wanting to edge farther away from him and the ingrained habit of offering comfort.

â€œIt was only a dream,â€ she said at last, staring up at the boards of the deck, no more than three feet above her head. If only this were a dream!

â€œAh, no,â€ he said, and his voice had dropped to little more than a whisper in the darkness beside her. â€œAh, no. Itâ€™s the sea herself. Callinâ€™ me, see?â€

Quite suddenly, he rolled toward her, seizing her and pressing her hard against him. She gasped, stiffening, and he pressed harder, responding, sharklike, to her struggles.

To her own horror, she felt LeRoi rising, and forced herself to be still. Panic and the need to escape his dream might all too easily make him forget his aversion to having sex with pregnant women, and that was the very last thing, the very last thing . . .

â€œSshh,â€ she said firmly, and clutched him round the head, forcing his face down into her shoulder, patting him, stroking his back. â€œShh. It will be all right. It was only a dream. I wonâ€™t let it hurt youâ€”I wonâ€™t let anything hurt you. Hush, hush now.â€

She went on patting him, her eyes closed, trying to imagine herself holding Jemmy after such a nightmare, quiet in their cabin, the hearth fire low, Jemâ€™s little body relaxing in trust, the sweet little-boy smell of his hair near her face. . . .

â€œI wonâ€™t let you drown,â€ she whispered. â€œI promise. I wonâ€™t let you drown.â€

She said it over and over, and slowly, slowly, his breathing eased, and his grip on her slackened as sleep overcame him. Still she repeated it, a soft, hypnotic murmur, her words half-lost in the sound of water, hissing past the side of the ship, and she spoke no longer to the man beside her, but to the slumbering child within.

â€œI wonâ€™t let anything hurt you. Nothing will hurt you. I promise.â€

RENDEZVOUS




ROGER PAUSED TO WIPE the sweat out of his eyes. Heâ€™d tied a folded kerchief round his head, but the humidity in the thick growth of the tidal forest was so high that sweat formed in his eye sockets, stinging and blurring his vision.

From a taproom in Edenton, the knowledge that Bonnet wasâ€”or would beâ€”on Ocracoke had seemed all heady conviction; the search narrowed suddenly to one tiny sandbar, versus the millions of other places the pirate could have been; how difficult could it be? Once on the bloody sandbar, the perspective had altered. The frigging island was narrow, but several miles long, with large patches of scrub forest, and most of its coastline fraught with hidden bars and dangerous eddies.

The skipper of the fishing boat theyâ€™d hired had got them there in good time; then theyâ€™d spent two days sailing up and down the length of the damn thing, looking for possible landing spots, likely pirate hideouts, and herds of wild horses. So far, none of these had appeared.

Having spent long enough retching over the sideâ€”Claire hadnâ€™t brought her acupuncture needles, having not foreseen the need of themâ€”Jamie had insisted upon being put ashore. He would walk the length of the island, he said, keeping an eye out for anything untoward. They could pick him up at sundown.

â€œAnd what if you run smack into Stephen Bonnet, all on your own?â€ Claire had demanded, when he refused to allow her to accompany him.

â€œIâ€™d rather be run through than puke to death,â€ was Jamieâ€™s elegant reply, â€œand besides, Sassenach, I need ye to stay here and make sure yon misbegotten son of aâ€”of a captain doesna sail away without us, aye?â€

So they had rowed him ashore and left him, watching as he strode away, staggering only slightly, into the thicket of scrub pines and palmetto.

Another day of frustration, spent sailing slowly up and down the coast, seeing nothing but the occasional ramshackle fishing shack, and Roger and Ian had begun to see the wisdom of Jamieâ€™s approach, as well.

â€œSee yon houses?â€ Ian pointed at a tiny cluster of shacks on the shore.

â€œIf ye want to call them that, yes.â€ Roger shaded his hand over his eyes to look, but the shacks looked deserted.

â€œIf they can get boats off there, we can get one on. Letâ€™s go ashore and see will the folk there tell us anything.â€

Leaving Claire glowering behind them, they had rowed ashore to make inquiriesâ€”to no avail. The only inhabitants of the tiny settlement were a few women and children, all of whom heard the name â€œBonnetâ€ and scuttled into their homes like clams digging into the sand.

Still, having felt solid ground under their feet, they were less than eager to admit defeat and go back to the fishing shack. â€œLetâ€™s have a look, then,â€ Ian had said, gazing thoughtfully into the sun-striped forest. â€œWeâ€™ll crisscross, aye?â€ He drew a quick series of Xâ€™s in the sand in illustration. â€œWeâ€™ll cover more ground, and meet up every so often. Whoever reaches the shore first each time will wait on the other.â€

Roger had nodded agreement, and with a cheery wave at the fishing boat and the small, indignant figure on its bow, had turned inland.

It was hot and still under the pines, and his progress was impaired by all sorts of low bushes, creepers, patches of sandburs and other stickery things. The going was a little easier near the shore, as the forest thinned and gave way to stretches of coarse sea oats, with dozens of tiny crabs that scuttled out of his wayâ€”or occasionally crunched under his feet.

Still, it was a relief to move, to feel that somehow he was doing something, was making progress toward finding Breeâ€”though he admitted to himself that he wasnâ€™t sure exactly what they were looking for. Was she here? Had Bonnet arrived on the island already? Or would he be coming in a day or two, at the dark of the moon, as Hepzibah had said?

Despite the worry, the heat, and the millions of gnats and mosquitoesâ€”they didnâ€™t bite, for the most part, but insisted upon crawling into his ears, eyes, nose, and mouthâ€”he smiled at the thought of Manfred. Heâ€™d been praying for the boy ever since his disappearance from the Ridge, that he might be restored to his family. Granted, to find him firmly attached to an ex-prostitute was likely not quite the answer to prayer that Ute McGillivray had been hoping for, but heâ€™d learned before that God had His own methods.

Lord, let her be safe. He didnâ€™t care how that prayer was answered, provided only that it was. Let me have her back, please.

It was well past mid-afternoon, and his clothes stuck to him with sweat, when he came to one of the dozens of small tidal inlets that cut into the island like the holes in Swiss cheese. It was too wide to leap across, so he made his way down the sandy bank and into the water. It was deeper than heâ€™d thoughtâ€”he was up to his neck by mid-channel, and had to swim a few strokes before he found solid footing on the other side.

The water pulled at him, rushing toward the sea; the tide had begun to turn. Likely the inlet would be much shallower when the tide was outâ€”but he thought a boat could make it up the inlet easily, with the tide coming in.

That was promising. Encouraged, he crawled out on the far side and began to follow the channel inland. Within minutes, he heard a sound in the distance and stopped dead, listening.

Horses. He would swear it was the sound of neighing, though so far away he couldnâ€™t be sure of it. He turned in a circle, trying to locate it, but the sound had vanished. Still, it seemed a sign, and he pushed on with renewed vigor, frightening a family of raccoons washing their meal in the water of the channel.

But then the inlet began to narrow, the water level dropping to no more than a footâ€”and then less, only a few inches of water running clear over dusky sand. He was loath to give up, though, and shoved his way under a low canopy of pine and twisted scrub oak. Then he stopped dead, skin tingling from scalp to sole.

Four of them. Crude stone pillars, pale in the shadow of the trees. One stood actually in the channel itself, tilted drunkenly by the action of the water. Another, on the bank, had carvings on its face, abstract symbols that he didnâ€™t recognize. He stood frozen, as though they were live things that might see him if he moved.

It seemed abnormally silent; even the insects seemed temporarily to have deserted him. He had no doubt that this was the circle the man Donner had described to Brianna. Here, the five men had chanted, walked their pattern, and turned, passing to the left of the inscribed stone. And here at least one of them had died. A profound shiver ran through him, despite the oppressive heat.

He moved at last, very carefully, backing away, as though the stones might wake, but did not turn his back on them until he was a good distance awayâ€”so far away that the stones were lost to sight, buried in the heavy growth. Then he turned and walked back toward the sea, fast, and then faster, â€™til the breath burned in his throat, feeling as though invisible eyes bored into his back.



I SAT IN THE SHADE of the forecastle, sipping cool beer and watching the shore. Just like bloody men, I thought, frowning at the tranquil stretch of sand. Charge in pigheaded, leaving the women to mind the store. Still . . . I wasnâ€™t so sure that I would have wanted to slog the length of the beastly island on foot myself. By repute, Blackbeard and a number of his confederates had used the place as a lair, and the reason why was obvious. A less hospitable shore Iâ€™d seldom seen.

The chance of finding anything in that secretive, wooded place by randomly poking into holes was low. Still, sitting on my bum in a boat while Brianna was dealing with Stephen Bonnet was making me twitch with anxiety and the urgent desire to do something.

But there was nothing to do, and the afternoon wore slowly away. I watched the shore steadily; now and then, I would see Roger or Ian pop out of the undergrowth, then the two of them would confer briefly before popping back in. Now and then, I looked to the northâ€”but there was no sign of Jamie.

Captain Roarke, who was in fact a misbegotten son of a poxed whore, as he cheerfully admitted himself, sat down with me for a time and accepted a bottle of beer. I congratulated myself on my forethought in having brought a few dozen, a few of which Iâ€™d put over the side in a net to keep cool; the beer was doing a lot to soothe my impatience, though my stomach was still knotted with worry.

â€œNone oâ€™ your men are what ye might call sailing men, are they?â€ Captain Roarke observed, after a thoughtful silence.

â€œWell, Mr. MacKenzieâ€™s spent a bit of time on fishing boats in Scotland,â€ I said, dropping an empty bottle into the net. â€œBut I wouldnâ€™t say heâ€™s an able seaman, no.â€

â€œAh.â€ He drank a bit more.

â€œAll right,â€ I said finally. â€œWhy?â€

He lowered his bottle and belched loudly, then blinked.

â€œOh. Well, maâ€™amâ€”I believe I did hear one oâ€™ the young men say as how there was a rondayvooz to occur, at dark oâ€™ moon?â€

â€œYes,â€ I said a little guardedly. We had told the captain as little as possible, not knowing whether he might have some association with Bonnet. â€œThe dark of the moon is tomorrow night, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œIt is,â€ he agreed. â€œBut what I mean to say isâ€”when one says â€˜dark oâ€™ moon,â€™ most likely one does mean nighttime, aye?â€ He peered into the empty neck of his bottle, then lifted it and blew thoughtfully across it, making a deep woooog sound.

I took the hint and handed him another.

â€œThank you kindly, maâ€™am,â€ he said, looking happy. â€œSee, the tide turns about half-eleven, this time oâ€™ monthâ€”and itâ€™s going out,â€ he added with emphasis.

I gave him a blank look.

â€œWell, if you look careful, maâ€™am, youâ€™ll see the tide is half out nowâ€â€”he pointed toward the southâ€”â€œyet thereâ€™s middling deep water close to shore all along oâ€™ here. Come the nighttime, though, it wonâ€™t be.â€

â€œYes?â€ I was still missing his point, but he was patient.

â€œWell, with the tide out, itâ€™s easier to see the bars and inlets, sureâ€”and were you coming in with a boat with a shallow draft, that would be the time to choose. But was the rondayvooz to be with something bigger, maybe anything that draws more than four feet . . . well, then.â€ He took a gulp, and pointed the bottom of his bottle toward a spot far down the shore. â€œThe water there is deep, maâ€™amâ€”see the color of it? Was I a ship of any size, that would be the safest place to anchor, when the tide is on the ebb.â€

I regarded the spot heâ€™d indicated. The water was distinctly darker there, a deeper blue-gray than the waves surrounding it.

â€œYou could have told us that earlier,â€ I said with a certain note of reproach.

â€œSo I could, maâ€™am,â€ he agreed cordially, â€œsave for not knowinâ€™ as youâ€™d like to hear it.â€ He got up then and wandered toward the stern, an empty bottle in hand, absently going woog-woog-woog, like a distant foghorn.

As the sun sank into the sea, Roger and Ian appeared on the shore, and Captain Roarkeâ€™s hand, Moses, rowed ashore to fetch them off. Then we hoisted sail and made our way slowly up the coast of Ocracoke, until we found Jamie, waving from a tiny spit of sand.

Anchored offshore for the night, we exchanged notes of our findingsâ€”or lack of them. All the men were drained, exhausted from heat and searching and with little appetite for supper, despite their exertions. Roger, in particular, looked drawn and pale, and said almost nothing.

The last sliver of the waning moon rose in the sky. With a minimum of conversation, the men took their blankets and lay down on deck, asleep within minutes.

Quantities of beer notwithstanding, I was wide awake. I sat beside Jamie, my own blanket wrapped about my shoulders against the coolness of the night wind, watching the low black mystery of the island. The anchorage Captain Roarke had pointed out to me was invisible in the darkness. Would we know, I wondered, if a ship were to come tomorrow night?



IN FACT, it came that night. I woke in the very early morning, dreaming of corpses. I sat up, heart pounding, to see Roarke and Moses at the rail, and a dreadful smell in the air. It wasnâ€™t a smell one would ever forget, and when I got to my feet and went to the rail to look, I was not at all surprised to hear Roarke murmur, â€œSlaver,â€ nodding toward the south.

The ship was anchored half a mile or so away, its masts black against the paling sky. Not a huge ship, but definitely too big to make its way into the small channels of the island. I watched a long time, joined by Jamie, Roger, and Ian as they wokeâ€”but no boats were lowered.

â€œWhat dâ€™ye suppose itâ€™s doing there?â€ Ian said. He spoke in a low voice; the slave ship made everyone nervous.

Roarke shook his head; he didnâ€™t like it, either.

â€œDamned if I know,â€ he said. â€œWouldnâ€™t expect such a thing in such a place. Not at all.â€

Jamie rubbed a hand across his unshaven chin. He hadnâ€™t shaved in days, and, green-faced and hollow-eyed beneath the stubbleâ€”heâ€™d vomited over the rail within minutes of rising, though the swell was very gentleâ€”looked even more disreputable than Roarke himself.

â€œCan ye lay us alongside her, Mr. Roarke?â€ he said, eyes on the slave ship. Roger glanced at him sharply.

â€œYe donâ€™t suppose Briannaâ€™s aboard?â€

â€œIf she is, weâ€™ll find out. If sheâ€™s notâ€”weâ€™ll maybe find out who yon ship has come to see.â€

It was full daylight by the time we came along the ship, and there were a number of hands on deck, all of whom peered curiously down over the rail at us.

Roarke hallooed up, asking permission to come aboard. There was no immediate response to this, but after a few minutes, a large man with an air of authority and an ill-tempered face appeared.

â€œWhat dâ€™ye want?â€ he called down.

â€œTo come aboard,â€ Roarke bellowed back.

â€œNo. Shove off.â€

â€œWe are in search of a young woman!â€ Roger called up. â€œWe should like to ask you a few questions!â€

â€œAny young women on this ship are mine,â€ the captainâ€”if thatâ€™s what he wasâ€”said definitely. â€œBugger off, I said.â€ He turned and gestured to his hands, who scattered at once, reappearing in moments with muskets.

Roger cupped his hands to his mouth.

â€œBRIANNA!â€ he bellowed. â€œBRIANNAAAA!â€

One man raised his gun and fired, the ball whistling safely over our heads, and ripping through the mainsail.

â€œOi!â€ shouted Roarke, incensed. â€œWhatâ€™s the matter of you?â€

The only answer to this was a fusillade of further shots, followed by the opening of the port lids nearest us, and the sudden appearance of the long black noses of several cannon, along with a more intense gust of stink.

â€œJesus God,â€ said Roarke, astonished. â€œWell, if thatâ€™s how you feel aboutâ€”well, God damn you!â€ he shouted, brandishing a fist. â€œGod damn you, I say!â€

Moses, less interested in rhetoric, had made sail with the first shot and was already at the tiller; we slid past the slave ship and into clean water within moments.

â€œWell, somethingâ€™s going on,â€ I remarked, looking back at the ship. â€œWhether itâ€™s to do with Bonnet or not.â€

Roger was clinging to the rail, his knuckles white.

â€œIt is,â€ Jamie said. He wiped a hand across his mouth, and grimaced. â€œCan ye keep in sight of her, but out of range, Mr. Roarke?â€ A fresh wave of the smell of sewage, corruption, and hopelessness hit us, and he turned the color of rancid suet. â€œAnd maybe upwind, too?â€

We were obliged to sail well out into the ocean and tack to and fro in order to meet these various conditions, but at length had beaten our way back and anchored a safe distance away, the slave ship barely visible. Here we lay through the rest of the day, taking it in turns to keep an eye on the strange ship through Captain Roarkeâ€™s telescope.

Nothing happened, though; no boats came from the ship, nor from the shore. And as we all sat silent on deck, watching the stars come out in a moonless sky, the ship was swallowed by the dark.





107




THE DARK OF THE MOON




THEY ANCHORED LONG BEFORE DAWN, and a small boat took them ashore.

â€œWhere is this?â€ she asked, voice rusty with disuseâ€”Bonnet had wakened her in the dark. They had made three stops along the way, at nameless coves where mysterious men came out of the shrubbery, rolling barrels or carrying bales, but she had not been taken off at any of them. This was a long, low island, thick with scrub forest and hazy with mist, looking haunted under a dying moon.

â€œOcracoke,â€ he answered, leaning forward to peer into the fog. â€œA bit farther to port, Denys.â€ The seaman at the oars leaned harder to the side, and the nose of the boat turned slowly, drawing nearer to the shore.

It was cold on the water; she was grateful for the thick cloak he had wrapped around her before handing her into the boat. Even so, the chill of the night and the open sea had little to do with the small, constant shiver that made her hands tremble and numbed her feet and fingers.

Soft murmurs between the pirates, further direction. Bonnet jumped off into waist-deep, muddy water, and waded into the shadows, pushing aside the heavy growth so that the water of the hidden inlet showed suddenly, a smooth dark gleam before them. The boat nosed its way under the overhanging trees, then paused, so that Bonnet could pull himself over the gunwales, splashing and dripping.

A shattering cry sounded near them, so close that she jerked, heart pounding, before realizing that it was only a bird somewhere in the swamp around them. Otherwise, the night was quiet, save for the muted, regular splash of the oars.

They had put Josh and the Fulani men into the boat, too; Josh sat at her feet, a hunched black form. He was shivering; she could feel it. Disengaging a fold of the cloak, she put it over him, and put a hand on his shoulder under it, meaning to give him what encouragement she could. A hand rose and settled softly over hers, squeezing, and thus linked, they sailed slowly into the dark unknown beneath the dripping trees.

The sky was lightening by the time the boat reached a small landing, and streaks of rose-tinted cloud reached across the horizon. Bonnet hopped out, and reached down to take her hand. Reluctantly, she let go of Josh, and stood up.

There was a house, half-hidden in the trees. Made of gray clapboards, it seemed to sink into the remnants of fog, as though it werenâ€™t quite real and might disappear at any moment.

The wind-borne stink, though, was real enough. Sheâ€™d never smelled it before herself, but had heard her motherâ€™s vivid description of it, and recognized it instantlyâ€”the smell of a slaver, anchored offshore. Josh recognized it, too; she heard his sudden gasp, and then a hasty murmurâ€”he was saying the Hail Mary in Gaelic, as fast as he could.

â€œTake these to the barracoon,â€ Bonnet said to the seaman, pushing Josh in his direction and waving at the Fulani. â€œThen go back to the ship. Tell Mr. Orden we sail for England in four daysâ€™ time; heâ€™ll see to the rest of the provisioning. Come for me Saturday, an hour before high tide.â€

â€œJosh!â€ She called after him, and he looked back, eyes white with fear, but the seaman hustled him along, and Bonnet dragged her in the other direction, up the path toward the house.

â€œWait! Where is he taking him? What are you going to do with him?â€ She dug her feet into the mud, and grabbed hold of a mangrove, refusing to move.

â€œSell him, what else?â€ Bonnet was matter-of-fact about that, and also about her refusal to move. â€œCome along, darlinâ€™. Ye know I can make ye, and ye know ye wonâ€™t like it if I do.â€ He reached out, flipped back the edge of her cloak, and pinched her nipple, hard, in illustration.

Burning with anger, she snatched the cloak back and wrapped it tight around her, as though that might soothe the pain. He had already turned, and was making his way up the path, quite certain that she would follow. To her everlasting shame, she did.



THE DOOR WAS OPENED by a black man, nearly as tall as Bonnet himself, and even wider through the chest and shoulder. A thick vertical scar between his eyes ran nearly from his hairline to the bridge of his nose, but it had the clean look of a deliberate tribal scar, not the result of accident.

â€œEmmanuel, me man!â€ Bonnet greeted the man cheerfully, and pushed Brianna ahead of him into the house. â€œLook what the cat dragged in, will ya?â€

The black man looked her up and down with an expression of doubt.

â€œShe damn tall,â€ he said, in a voice that held an African lilt. He took her by the shoulder and turned her round, running a hand down her back and cupping her buttocks briefly through the cloak. â€œNice fat arse, though,â€ he admitted grudgingly.

â€œIsnâ€™t it, though? Well, be seeing to her, then come tell me how it is here. The holdâ€™s near fullâ€”oh, and Iâ€™ve picked up fourâ€”no, fiveâ€”more blacks. The men can go to Captain Jackson, but the womenâ€”ah, now, those are somethinâ€™ special.â€ He winked at Emmanuel. â€œTwins.â€

The black manâ€™s face went rigid.

â€œTwins?â€ he said in a tone of horror. â€œYou bring them in the house?â€

â€œI will,â€ Bonnet said firmly. â€œFulani, and gorgeous things they are, too. No English, no trainingâ€”but theyâ€™ll go for fancies, sure. Speakinâ€™ of which, have we word from Signor Ricasoli?â€

Emmanuel nodded, though his brow was furrowed; the scar pulled the frown lines into a deep â€œV.â€

â€œHe be here on Thursday. Monsieur Houvener comes then, too. Mister Howard be here tomorrow, though.â€

â€œSplendid. Iâ€™m wanting me breakfast nowâ€”and I imagine youâ€™re hungry as well, arenâ€™t ye, darlinâ€™?â€ he asked, turning to Brianna.

She nodded, torn between fear, outrage, and morning sickness. She had to eat something, and fast.

â€œFine, then. Take her somewhereâ€â€”he flipped a hand toward the ceiling, indicating rooms upstairsâ€”â€œand feed her. Iâ€™ll eat in me office; come find me there.â€

Without acknowledgment of the order, Emmanuel clamped a hand like a vise on the back of her neck, and shoved her toward the stairs.



THE BUTLER â€”if one could describe something like Emmanuel with such a domestic termâ€”pushed her into a small room and shut the door behind her. It was furnished, but sparsely: a bed frame with a bare mattress, one woolen blanket, and a chamber pot. She made use of the latter object with relief, then made a rapid reconnaissance of the room itself.

There was only one window, a small one, set with metal bars. There was no glass, only inside shutters, and the breath of sea and scrub forest filled the room, vying with dust and the stale smell of the stained mattress. Emmanuel might be a factotum, but he wasnâ€™t much of a housekeeper, she thought, trying to keep her spirits up.

A familiar sound came to her, and she craned her neck to see. Not much was visible from the windowâ€”only the white crushed shells and sandy mud that surrounded the house, and the tops of stunted pines. If she pressed her face to the side of the window, though, she could see a small slice of a distant beach, with white breakers rolling in. As she watched, three horses galloped across it, vanishing out of her viewâ€”but with the wind-borne sound of neighing, then came five more, and then another group of seven or eight. Wild horses, the descendants of Spanish ponies left here a century ago.

The sight of them charmed her, and she watched for a long time, hoping they would come back, but they didnâ€™t; only a flight of pelicans passed by, and a few gulls, diving for fish.

The sight of the horses had made her feel less alone for a few moments, but no less empty. She had been in the room for half an hour, at least, and there were no sounds of footsteps in the hall outside, bringing food. Cautiously, she tried the door, and was surprised to find it unlocked.

There were sounds downstairs; someone was here. And the warm, grainy aromas of porridge and baking bread were faint in the air.

Swallowing to keep her stomach down, she moved soft-footed through the house and down the stairs. There were male voices in a room at the front of the houseâ€”Bonnet and Emmanuel. The sound of them made her diaphragm tighten, but the door was closed, and she tiptoed past.

The kitchen was a cookshack, a separate small building outside, connected to the house by a short breezeway and surrounded by a fenced yard that also enclosed the back of the house. She gave the fenceâ€”very tall, and spikedâ€”a glance, but first things first: she had to have food.

There was someone in the kitchen; she could hear the movements of pots, and a womanâ€™s voice, muttering something. The smell of food was strong enough to lean against. She pushed open the door and went in, pausing to let the cook see her. Then she saw the cook.

She was so battered by circumstance at this point that she only blinked, certain she was seeing things.

â€œPhaedre?â€ she said uncertainly.

The girl swung around, wide-eyed and open-mouthed with shock.

â€œOh, sweet Jesus!â€ She glanced wildly behind Brianna, then, seeing that she was alone, grabbed Briannaâ€™s arm and pulled her out into the yard.

â€œWhat you doing here?â€ she demanded, sounding fierce. â€œHow do you come to be here?â€

â€œStephen Bonnet,â€ Brianna said briefly. â€œHow on earth did youâ€”did he kidnap you? From River Run?â€ She couldnâ€™t think howâ€”or whyâ€”but everything from the moment she had learned she was pregnant had had the surreal feel of hallucination, and how much of this was due to pregnancy alone she had no real idea.

Phaedre was shaking her head, though.

â€œNo, miss. That Bonnet, he got me a month ago. From a man name Butler,â€ she added, mouth twisting in an expression that made clear her loathing of Butler.

The name seemed vaguely familiar to Brianna. She thought it was the name of a smuggler; she had never met him, but had heard the name now and then. He wasnâ€™t the smuggler who provided her aunt with tea and other contraband luxuries, thoughâ€”she had met that man, a disconcertingly effete and dainty gentleman named Wilbraham Jones.

â€œI donâ€™t understand. Butâ€”wait, is there anything to eat?â€ she asked, the floor of her stomach dropping suddenly.

â€œOh. Surely. You wait here.â€ Phaedre vanished back into the kitchen, light-footed, and was back in an instant with half a loaf of bread and a crock of butter.

â€œThank you.â€ She grabbed the bread and ate some hastily, not bothering to butter it, then put down her head between her knees and breathed for a few minutes, until the nausea subsided.

â€œSorry,â€ she said, raising her head at last. â€œIâ€™m pregnant.â€

Phaedre nodded, plainly unsurprised.

â€œWho by?â€ she asked.

â€œMy husband,â€ Brianna answered. Sheâ€™d spoken tartly, but then realized, with a small lurch of her unsettled innards, that it could so easily be otherwise. Phaedre had been gone from River Run for monthsâ€”God only knew what had happened to her in that span of time.

â€œHeâ€™s not had you long, then.â€ Phaedre glanced at the house.

â€œNo. You said a monthâ€”have you tried to get away?â€

â€œOnce.â€ The girlâ€™s mouth twisted again. â€œYou see that man Emmanuel?â€

Brianna nodded.

â€œHe an Ibo. Track a haunt through a cypress swamp, and make it sorry when he catch it.â€ She wrapped her arms around herself, though the day was warm.

The yard was fenced with eight-foot pointed pine stakes, laced with rope. She might get over them, with a foot up from Phaedre . . . but then she saw the shadow of a man pass by on the other side, a gun across his shoulder.

She would have guessed as much, had she been capable of organized thought. This was Bonnetâ€™s hideawayâ€”and judging from the piles of boxes, bundles, and casks stacked haphazardly in the yard, it was also where he kept valuable cargo before selling it. Naturally, it would be guarded.

A faint breeze wafted through the pickets of the fence, carrying the same vile stench she had smelled when they came ashore. She took another quick bite of bread, forcing it down as ballast for her queasy stomach.

Phaedreâ€™s nostrils flared, then pinched at the reek.

â€œBe a slave ship, anchored past the breakers,â€ she said very quietly, and swallowed. â€œCaptain come in yesterday, see if Mr. Bonnet have something for him, but he ainâ€™t back yet. Captain Jackson say he come again tomorrow.â€

Brianna could feel Phaedreâ€™s fear, like a pale yellow miasma wavering over her skin, and took another bite of bread.

â€œHe wonâ€™tâ€”he wouldnâ€™t sell you to this Jackson?â€ She wouldnâ€™t put anything at all past Bonnet. But she did by now understand things about slavery. Phaedre was a prime item: light-skinned, young, and prettyâ€”and trained as a body servant. Bonnet could get a very good price for her almost anywhere, and from what little she knew of slavers, they dealt in raw slaves from Africa.

Phaedre shook her head, her lips gone pale.

â€œI donâ€™t think so. He say Iâ€™m what he call a â€˜fancy.â€™ Thatâ€™s why heâ€™s kept me so long; he got some men he know, come up from the Indies this week. Planters.â€ She swallowed again, looking ill. â€œThey buy pretty women.â€

The bread Brianna had eaten melted suddenly into a soggy, slimy mass in her stomach, and with a certain feeling of fatality, she got up and took a few steps away before throwing up over a bale of raw cotton.

Stephen Bonnetâ€™s voice echoed in her head, cheerfully jovial.

â€œWhy bother takinâ€™ ye all the way to London, where yeâ€™d be of no particular use to anyone? Besides, it rains quite a bit in London; Iâ€™m sure ye wouldnâ€™t like it.â€

â€œThey buy pretty women,â€ she whispered, leaning against the palisades, waiting for the sense of clamminess to fade. But white women?

Why not? said the coldly logical part of her brain. Women are property, black or white. If you can be owned, you can be sold. She herself had owned Lizzie, for a time.

She wiped her sleeve over her mouth, and went back to Phaedre, who was sitting on a roll of copper, her fine-boned face thin and drawn with worry.

â€œJoshâ€”he took Josh, too. When we came ashore, he told them to take Josh to the barracoon.â€

â€œJoshua?â€ Phaedre sat up straight, eyes huge. â€œJoshua, Miss Joâ€™s groom? Heâ€™s here?â€

â€œYes. Whereâ€™s the barracoon, do you know?â€

Phaedre had hopped to her feet and was striding to and fro, agitated.

â€œI ainâ€™t knowing for sure. I cook up food for the slaves there, but be one of the seamen takes it. Canâ€™t be far from the house, though.â€

â€œIs it a big one?â€

Phaedre shook her head emphatically at that.

â€œNoâ€™m. Mr. Bonnet, he ainâ€™t really in the slaving business. He pick up a few, here and thereâ€”and then he got his â€˜fanciesâ€™â€â€”she grimaced at thatâ€”â€œbut canâ€™t be moreâ€™n a dozen here, amount of food they eat. Three girls in the houseâ€”five, counting they Fulani he say heâ€™s bringing.â€

Feeling better, Brianna began to cast about the yard, searching for anything that might be of use. It was a hodgepodge of valuable thingsâ€”everything from bolts of Chinese silk, wrapped in linen and oiled cloth, and crates of porcelain dishes, to rolls of copper, casks of brandy, bottles of wine packed in straw, and chests of tea. She opened one of these, breathing in the soft perfume of the leaves and finding it wonderfully soothing to her internal distress. Sheâ€™d give almost anything for a hot cup of tea just now.

Even more interesting, though, were a number of small barrels, thick-walled and tightly sealed, containing gunpowder.

â€œIf only I had a few matches,â€ she muttered to herself, looking at them longingly. â€œOr even a striker.â€ But fire was fire, and there was certainly one in the kitchen. She looked at the house carefully, thinking exactly where to place the barrelsâ€”but she couldnâ€™t blow the place up, not with the other slaves inside, and not without knowing what sheâ€™d do next.

The sound of the door opening galvanized her; by the time Emmanuel looked out, she had jumped away from the gunpowder, and was examining an enormous box enclosing a grandfather clock, the gilded faceâ€”decorated with three animated sailing ships on a sea of silverâ€”peeping out behind the protective laths nailed over it.

â€œYou, girl,â€ he said to Brianna, and jerked his chin. â€œYou come wash yourself.â€ He gave Phaedre a hard lookâ€”Brianna saw that she wouldnâ€™t meet his eyes, but hastily began to pick up sticks of kindling from the ground.

The hand clamped hard on her neck again, and she was marched ignominiously back into the house.



THIS TIME, Emmanuel did lock the door. He brought her a basin and ewer, a towel, and a clean shift. Much, much later, he came back, bringing a tray of food. But he ignored all questions, and locked the door again upon leaving.

She pulled the bed over to the window and knelt on it, elbows wedged between the bars. There was nothing to do but thinkâ€”and that was something she would as soon put off a little longer. She watched the forest and the distant beach, the shadows of the scrub pines creeping over the sand, the oldest of sundials, marking the snaillike progress of the hours.

After a long time, her knees grew numb and her elbows hurt, and she spread the cloak over the nasty mattress, trying not to consider the various stains on it, nor the smell. Lying on her side, she watched the sky through the window, the infinitesimal changes of the light from one moment to the next, and considered in detail the specific pigments and the exact brushstrokes she would use to paint it. Then she got up and began pacing to and fro, counting her steps, estimating distance.

The room was about eight feet by ten; 5,280 feet in a mile. Five hundred and twenty-eight laps. She really hoped Bonnetâ€™s office was underneath her.

Nothing, though, was enough, and as the room darkened and she reached two miles, she found Roger in her mindâ€”where he had been all along, unacknowledged.

She sank down on the bed, hot from the exercise, and watched the last of the flaming color fade from the sky.

Had he been ordained, as he wanted so much? He had been worried about the question of predestination, not sure that he could take the Holy Orders he desired, if he were not able to subscribe wholeheartedly to that notionâ€”well, she called it a notion; to Presbyterians, it was dogma. She smiled wryly, thinking of Hiram Crombie.

Ian had told her about Crombie earnestly attempting to explain the doctrine of predestination to the Cherokee. Most of them had listened politely, then ignored him. Birdâ€™s wife, Penstemon, though, had been interested by the argument, and followed Crombie about during the day, playfully pushing him, then crying out, â€˜Did your God know I would do that? How could he know thatâ€”I didnâ€™t know I would do that!â€™, or in more thoughtful mood, trying to get him to explain how the idea of predestination might work in terms of gamblingâ€”like most of the Indians, Penstemon would bet on almost anything.

She thought Penstemon had probably had a lot to do with the shortness of Crombieâ€™s initial visit to the Indians. She had to give him credit, though: heâ€™d gone back. And back again. He believed in what he was doing.

As did Roger. Damn, she thought wearily, there he was again, those soft moss-green eyes of his dark with thought, running a finger slowly down the bridge of his nose.

â€œDoes it really matter?â€ sheâ€™d said at last, tiring of the discussion of predestination, and privately pleased that Catholics werenâ€™t required to believe any such thing and were content to let God work in mysterious ways. â€œDoesnâ€™t it matter more that you can help people, that you can offer comfort?â€

Theyâ€™d been in bed, the candle extinguished, talking by the glow of the hearth. She could feel the shift of his body as he moved, his hand playing with a strand of her hair as he considered.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ heâ€™d said at last. Heâ€™d smiled a little then, looking up at her.

â€œDo ye not think any time-traveler must be a bit of a theologian, though?â€

Sheâ€™d taken a deep, martyred breath, and heâ€™d laughed then, and let it go, kissing her instead and descending to far earthier matters.

Heâ€™d been right, though. No one who had traveled through the stones could help asking it: why me? And who would answer that question, if not God?

Why me? And the ones who didnâ€™t make itâ€”why them? She felt a small chill, thinking of those. The anonymous bodies, listed in Geillis Duncanâ€™s notebook; Donnerâ€™s companions, dead on arrival. And speaking of Geillis Duncan . . . the thought came to her suddenly; the witch had died here, out of her own time.

Putting metaphysics aside and looking at the matter purely in terms of scienceâ€”and it must have a scientific basis, she argued stubbornly, it wasnâ€™t magic, no matter what Geilie Duncan had thoughtâ€”the laws of thermodynamics held that neither mass nor energy could be created nor destroyed. Only changed.

Changed how, though? Did movement through time constitute change? A mosquito whined past her ear, and she flapped her hand to drive it away.

You could go both ways; they knew that for a fact. The obvious implicationâ€”which neither Roger nor her mother had mentioned, so perhaps they hadnâ€™t seen itâ€”was that one could go into the future from a starting point, rather than only into the past and back.

So perhaps if someone traveled to the past and died there, as Geillis Duncan and Otter-Tooth had both demonstrably done . . . perhaps that must be balanced by someone traveling to the future and dying there?

She closed her eyes, unableâ€”or unwillingâ€”to follow that train of thought any further. Far in the distance, she heard the sound of the surf, pounding on the sand, and thought of the slave ship. Then she realized that the smell of it was here, and rising suddenly, went to the window. She could just see the far end of the path that led to the house; as she watched, a big man in a dark-blue coat and hat stumped rapidly out of the trees, followed by two others, shabbily dressed. Sailors, she thought, seeing the roll of their gait.

This must be Captain Jackson, then, come to conduct his business with Bonnet.

â€œOh, Josh,â€ she said out loud, and had to sit down on the bed, a wave of faintness washing over her.

Who had it been? One of the Saint Theresasâ€”Theresa of Avila? Whoâ€™d said in exasperation to God, â€œWell, if this is how You treat Your friends, no wonder You have so few of them!â€



SHE HAD FALLEN asleep hinking of Roger. She waked in the morning thinking of the baby.

For once, the nausea and the odd sense of dislocation were absent. All she felt was a deep peace, and a sense of . . . curiosity?

Are you there? she thought, hands across her womb. Nothing so definite as an answer; but knowledge was there, as sure as the beating of her own heart.

Good, she thought, and fell asleep again.

Noises from below awakened her sometime later. She sat up suddenly, hearing loud voices raised, then swayed, feeling faint, and lay down again. The nausea had returned, but if she closed her eyes and kept very still, it lay dormant, like a sleeping snake.

The voices continued, rising and falling, with the occasional loud thud for punctuation, as though a fist had struck a wall or table. After a few minutes, though, the voices ceased, and she heard nothing further until light footsteps came to her door. The lock rattled, and Phaedre came in, with a tray of food.

She sat up, trying not to breathe; the smell of anything fried . . .

â€œWhatâ€™s going on down there?â€ she asked.

Phaedre pulled a face.

â€œThat Emmanuel, heâ€™s not best pleased with they Fulani women. Ibo, they think twins are bad, bad luckâ€”any woman bear twins, she take them out in the forest, leave them there to die. Emmanuel want to send the Fulani off with Captain Jackson first thing, get them out the house, but Mr. Bonnet, he say he waiting on the gentlemen from the Indies, get a lots better price.â€

â€œGentlemen from the Indiesâ€”what gentlemen?â€

Phaedre lifted her shoulders.

â€œI ainâ€™t knowing. Gentlemen he think he sell things to. Sugar planters, I reckon. You eat that; I be back later.â€

Phaedre turned to go, but Brianna suddenly called after her.

â€œWait! You didnâ€™t tell me yesterdayâ€”who took you from River Run?â€

The girl turned back, looking reluctant.

â€œMr. Ulysses.â€

â€œUlysses?â€ Brianna said, disbelieving. Phaedre heard the doubt in her voice, and gave her a flat, angry look.

â€œWhat, you donâ€™t believe me?â€

â€œNo, no,â€ Brianna hastily assured her. â€œI do believe you. Onlyâ€”why?â€

Phaedre breathed in deeply through her nose.

â€œBecause I am one damn stupid nigger,â€ she said bitterly. â€œMy mama told me, she say never, ever cross Ulysses. But did I listen?â€

â€œCross him,â€ Brianna said warily. â€œHow did you cross him?â€ She gestured to the bed, inviting Phaedre to sit down. The girl hesitated for a moment, but then did, smoothing a hand over the white cloth tied round her head, over and over, while she searched for words.

â€œMr. Duncan,â€ she said at last, and her face softened a little. â€œHe a nice, nice man. You know he never been with a woman? He got kicked by a horse when he young, hurt his balls, think he canâ€™t do nothing that way.â€

Brianna nodded; sheâ€™d heard something of Duncanâ€™s trouble from her mother.

â€œWell,â€ Phaedre said with a sigh. â€œHe wrong about that.â€ She glanced at Brianna, to see how she might take this admission. â€œHe wasnâ€™t meaning no harm, and nor was I. It justâ€”happened.â€ She shrugged. â€œBut Ulysses, he find it out; he find out every single thing goes on at River Run, sooner or later. Maybe one of the girls told him, maybe some other way, but he knew. And he told me that ainâ€™t right, I put a stop to it this minute.â€

â€œBut you didnâ€™t?â€ Brianna guessed.

Phaedre shook her head slowly, lips pushed out.

â€œTold him Iâ€™d stop when Mr. Duncan didnâ€™t want to no moreâ€”not his business. See, I thought Mr. Duncan, he the master. Ainâ€™t true, though; Ulysses be the master at River Run.â€

â€œSo heâ€”he took you awayâ€”sold you?â€”to stop you sleeping with Duncan?â€ Why would he care? she wondered. Was he afraid Jocasta would discover the affair and be hurt?

â€œNo, he sell me because I told him if he donâ€™t leave me and Mr. Duncan be, then I tell about him and Miss Jo.â€

â€œHim and . . .â€ Brianna blinked, not believing what she was hearing. Phaedre looked at her, and gave a small, ironic smile.

â€œHe share Miss Joâ€™s bed these twenty years and more. Since before Old Master die, my mama said. Every slave there knows it; ainâ€™t one stupid enough to say so to his face, â€™cept me.â€

Brianna knew she was gaping like a goldfish, but couldnâ€™t help it. A hundred tiny things sheâ€™d seen at River Run, myriad small intimacies between her aunt and the butler, suddenly took on new significance. No wonder her aunt had gone to such lengths to get him back after the death of Lieutenant Wolff. And no wonder, either, that Ulysses had taken instant action. Phaedre might have been believed, or not; the mere accusation would have destroyed him.

Phaedre sighed, and rubbed a hand over her face.

â€œHe ainâ€™t waste no time. That very night, he and Mr. Jones come take me from my bed, wrap me up tight in a blanket, and carry me away in a wagon. Mr. Jones, he say he ainâ€™t no slaver, but he do it as a favor for Mr. Ulysses. So he donâ€™t keep me; he take me way downriver, though, sell me in Wilmington to a man what owns an ordinary. Thatâ€™s not too bad, but then a couple months later, Mr. Jones comes and takes me backâ€”Wilmingtonâ€™s not far enough away to suit Ulysses. So he give me to Mr. Butler, and Mr. Butler, he take me to Edenton.â€

She looked down, pleating the quilt between long, graceful fingers. Her lips were tight, and her face slightly flushed. Brianna forbore to ask what she had done for Butler in Edenton, thinking that she had likely been employed in a brothel.

â€œAnd . . . er . . . Stephen Bonnet found you there?â€ she hazarded.

Phaedre nodded, not looking up.

â€œWon me in a card game,â€ she said succinctly. She stood up. â€œI got to go; I had me enough of crossing black menâ€”ainâ€™t risking no more beatings from that Emmanuel.â€

Brianna was beginning to emerge from the shock of hearing about Ulysses and her aunt. A sudden thought occurred to her, and she jumped out of bed, hurrying to catch Phaedre before she reached the door.

â€œWait, wait! Just one more thingâ€”do youâ€”do the slaves at River Runâ€”know anything about the gold?â€

â€œWhat, in Old Masterâ€™s tomb? Surely.â€ Phaedreâ€™s face expressed a cynical surprise that there could be any doubt about it. â€œAinâ€™t nobody touch it, though. Everybody know there a curse on it.â€

â€œDo you know anything about its disappearing?â€

Phaedreâ€™s face went blank.

â€œDisappearing?â€

â€œOh, waitâ€”no, you wouldnâ€™t know; you . . . left, long before it disappeared. I just wondered, you know, whether maybe Ulysses had something to do with that.â€

Phaedre shook her head.

â€œI donâ€™t know nothing about that. But I ainâ€™t put one thing past Ulysses, curse or no.â€ There was a sound of heavy footsteps on the stair, and she paled. Without a word or gesture of farewell, she slipped out the door and closed it; Brianna heard the frantic fumbling of the key on the other side, and then the click of the closing lock.



EMMANUEL, silent as a lizard, brought her a dress in the afternoon. It was too short by a good bit, and too tight in the bosom, but a heavy blue watered silk, and well-made. It had plainly been worn before; there were sweat stains on it and it smelledâ€”of fear, she thought, repressing a shudder as she struggled into it.

She was sweating herself as Emmanuel led her downstairs, though a pleasant breeze swept through the open windows, stirring the curtains. The house was very simple, for the most part, with bare wooden floors and little more than stools and bed frames by way of furniture. The room downstairs to which Emmanuel showed her was such a contrast that it might have belonged to a different house entirely.

Rich Turkey rugs covered the floor in a overlapping riot of color, and the furniture, while of several different styles, was all heavy and elaborate, carved wood and silk upholstery. Silver and crystal glittered from every available surface, and a chandelierâ€”much too large for the roomâ€”hung with crystal pendants sprayed the room with tiny rainbows. It was a pirateâ€™s idea of a rich manâ€™s roomâ€”lavish abundance, displayed with no sense of style or taste.

The rich man seated by the window appeared not to mind his surroundings, though. A thin man in a wig, with a prominent Adamâ€™s apple, he looked to be in his thirties, though his skin was lined and yellowed by some tropical disease. He glanced sharply at the door as she entered, then rose to his feet.

Bonnet had been entertaining his guest; there were glasses and a decanter on the table, and the smell of brandy was sweet and heavy in the air. Brianna felt her stomach shift queasily, and wondered what theyâ€™d do if she were to vomit on the Turkey rug.

â€œThere ye are, darlinâ€™,â€ Bonnet said, coming to take her by the hand. She pulled it away from him, but he affected not to notice, and instead pushed her toward the thin man, a hand in the small of her back. â€œCome and make your bob to Mr. Howard, sweetheart.â€

She drew herself to her full heightâ€”she was a good four inches taller than Mr. Howard, whose eyes widened at sight of herâ€”and glowered down at him.

â€œI am being held against my will, Mr. Howard. My husband and my father willâ€”ow!â€ Bonnet had gripped her wrist and twisted it, hard.

â€œLovely, is she not?â€ he said conversationally, as though she had not spoken.

â€œOh, yes. Yes, indeed. Very tall, though . . .â€ Howard walked round her, examining her dubiously. â€œAnd red hair, Mr. Bonnet? I do really prefer blond.â€

â€œOh, do you indeed, you little pissant!â€ she snapped, in spite of Bonnetâ€™s grip on her arm. â€œWhere do you get off, preferring things?â€ With a wrench, she pulled away from Bonnet and rounded on Howard.

â€œNow, look,â€ she said, trying to sound reasonableâ€”he was blinking at her in a faintly bewildered fashionâ€” â€œI am a woman of goodâ€”of excellentâ€”family, and I have been kidnapped. My fatherâ€™s name is James Fraser, my husband is Roger MacKenzie, and my aunt is Mrs. Hector Cameron, of River Run Plantation.â€

â€œIs she really of good family?â€ Howard addressed this question to Bonnet, appearing to be more interested.

Bonnet bowed slightly in affirmation.

â€œOh, indeed she is, sir. The finest blood!â€

â€œHmmm. And good health, I see.â€ Howard had resumed his examination, leaning close to peer at her. â€œHas she bred before?â€

â€œAye, sir, a healthy son.â€

â€œGood teeth?â€ Howard rose on his toes, looking inquisitive, and Bonnet obligingly yanked one arm behind her back to hold her still, then took a handful of her hair and jerked her head back, making her gasp.

Howard took her chin in one hand and pried at the corner of her mouth with the other, poking experimentally at her molars.

â€œVery nice,â€ he said approvingly. â€œAnd I will say the skin is very fine. Butâ€”â€

She jerked her chin out of his grasp, and bit down as hard as she could on Howardâ€™s thumb, feeling the meat of it shift and tear between her molars with a sudden copper taste of blood.

He shrieked and struck at her; she let go and dodged, enough so his hand glanced off her cheek. Bonnet let go, and she took two fast steps back and fetched up hard against the wall.

â€œSheâ€™s bitten me thumb off, the bitch!â€ Eyes watering in agony, Mr. Howard swayed to and fro, cradling his wounded hand against his chest. Fury flooded his face and he lunged toward her, free hand drawn back, but Bonnet seized him by the wrist and pulled him aside.

â€œNow then, sir,â€ he said. â€œI cannot allow ye to damage her, sure. Sheâ€™s not yours yet, is she?â€

â€œI donâ€™t care if sheâ€™s mine or not,â€ Howard cried, face suffused with blood. â€œIâ€™ll beat her to death!â€

â€œOh, no, surely ye donâ€™t mean that, Mr. Howard,â€ Bonnet said, his voice jovially soothing. â€œA cruel waste that would be. Leave her to me, will ye, then?â€ Not waiting for an answer, he pulled Brianna after him, dragging her stumbling across the room, and thrust her toward the silent factotum, who had waited motionless by the door through the conversation.

â€œTake her out, Manny, and teach her her manners, will ye? And gag her before ye bring her back.â€

Emmanuel didnâ€™t smile, but a faint light seemed to burn in the black depths of his pupilless eyes. His fingers dug between the bones of her wrist and she gasped with pain, jerking in a vain attempt to free herself. With a single quick movement, the Ibo whirled her round and twisted up her arm behind her back, bending her half forward. Sharp pain shot up her arm as she felt her shoulder tendons begin to part. He pulled harder and a dark wave passed over her vision. Through it, she heard Bonnetâ€™s voice calling out behind them as Emmanuel propelled her through the door.

â€œNot in the face, mind, Manny, and no permanent marks.â€



HOWARDâ€™S VOICE had quite lost its choked note of fury. It was still choked, but with something more like awe.

â€œMy God,â€ he said. â€œOh, my God.â€

â€œA charminâ€™ sight, is it not?â€ Bonnet agreed cordially.

â€œCharming,â€ Howard echoed. â€œOhâ€”the most charming thing I believe I have ever seen. Such a shade! Might Iâ€”â€ The hunger in his voice was evident, and Brianna felt the vibration of his footstep on the carpet, a split second before his hands clamped tight on her buttocks. She screamed behind the gag, but she was bent hard across the table, with the edge cutting into her diaphragm, and the sound came out as no more than a grunt. Howard laughed joyfully, and let go.

â€œOh, look,â€ he said, sounding enchanted. â€œLook, do you see? The most perfect print of my handsâ€”so white on the crimson . . . she is so hot . . . oh, itâ€™s fading. Let me justâ€”â€

She clenched her legs tight together and stiffened as he fondled her naked privates, but then his touch was gone, and Bonnet had taken his hand off her neck, and was pulling his customer away from her.

â€œAh, now, thatâ€™s enough, sir. After all, sheâ€™s not your propertyâ€”not yet.â€ Bonnetâ€™s tone was jovial, but firm. Howardâ€™s response was immediately to offer a sum that made her gasp behind the gag, but Bonnet only laughed.

â€œThatâ€™s generous, sir, so it is, but â€™twouldnâ€™t be fair on my other customers, would it, to be takinâ€™ your offer without letting them make their own? No, sir, I do appreciate it, but I mean to auction this one; Iâ€™m afraid yeâ€™ll needs be waiting on the day.â€

Howard was disposed to protest, to offer moreâ€”he was most urgently in earnest, he protested that he could not wait, was ravished by desire, a great deal too warm to abide delay . . . but Bonnet only demurred, and in a few moments had ushered him out of the room. Brianna heard his voice protesting, dying away as Emmanuel removed him.

She had stood up as soon as Bonnet took his hand off her neck, wriggling madly to shake her skirts down. Emmanuel had tied her hands behind her back, as well as gagging her. If he hadnâ€™t, she would have tried to kill Stephen Bonnet with her bare hands.

This thought must have been visible on her face, for Bonnet glanced at her, looked again, and laughed.

â€œYe did amazing well, darlinâ€™,â€ he said, and leaning over, negligently pulled the gag down from her mouth. â€œThat man will empty his purse for the chance to get his hands on your arse again.â€

â€œYou God damn . . . youâ€”â€ She shook with rage, and with the futility of finding any epithet that came close to being strong enough. â€œI will fucking kill you!â€

He laughed again.

â€œOh, now, sweetheart. For a sore arse? Consider it a repaymentâ€”in partâ€”for my left ball.â€ He chucked her under the chin, and went toward the table where the tray with the decanters stood. â€œYeâ€™ve earned a drink. Brandy or porter?â€

She ignored the offer, trying to keep her rage in check. Her cheeks flamed with furious blood, and so did her outraged bottom.

â€œWhat do you mean, â€˜auctionâ€™?â€ she demanded.

â€œI should think that clear enough, sweetheart. Yeâ€™ve heard the word, sure.â€ Bonnet gave her a glance of mild amusement, and pouring himself a tot of brandy, drank it off in two swallows. â€œHah.â€ He exhaled, blinking, and shook his head.

â€œHoo. Iâ€™ve two more customers in the market for someone like you, darlinâ€™. Theyâ€™ll be here tomorrow or next day to be having a look. Then Iâ€™ll ask for bids, and yeâ€™ll be off to the Indies by Friday, I expect.â€

He spoke casually, without the slightest hint of jeering. That, more than anything, made her insides waver. She was a matter of business, a piece of merchandise. To him, and to his goddamned bloody customers, tooâ€”Mr. Howard had made that clear. It didnâ€™t matter what she said; they werenâ€™t at all interested in who she was or what she might want.

Bonnet was watching her face, his pale green eyes assessing. He was interested, she realized, and her insides curled up into a knot.

â€œWhat did ye use on her, Manny?â€ he asked.

â€œA wooden spoon,â€ the manservant said indifferently. â€œYou said no marks.â€

Bonnet nodded, thoughtful.

â€œNothing permanent, I said,â€ he corrected. â€œWeâ€™ll leave her as she is for Mr. Ricasoli, I think, but Mr. Houvener . . . well, weâ€™ll wait and see.â€

Emmanuel merely nodded, but his eyes rested on Brianna with sudden interest. Her stomach everted itself neatly and she vomited, absolutely ruining the fine silk dress.



THE SOUND OF high-pitched whinnying reached her; wild horses, rioting down the beach. If this were a romance novel, she thought grimly, sheâ€™d make a rope from the bedclothes, let herself down from the window, find the horse herd, and, by exercising her mystical skills with horses, persuade one of them to carry her to safety.

As it was, there were no bedclothesâ€”only a ratty mattress made of ticking stuffed with sea grassâ€”and as for getting within a mile of wild horses . . . She would have given a lot for Gideon, and felt tears prickle at thought of him.

â€œOh, now you are losing your mind,â€ she said aloud, wiping her eyes. â€œCrying over a horse.â€ Especially that horse. That was so much better than thinking of Roger, thoughâ€”or Jem. No, she absolutely could not think about Jemmy, nor the possibility of his growing up without her, without knowing why she had abandoned him. Or the new one . . . and what life might be like for the child of a slave.

But she was thinking of them, and the thought was enough to overcome her momentary despair.

All right, then. She was getting out of here. Preferably before Mr. Ricasoli and Mr. Houvener, whoever they were, turned up. For the thousandth time, she moved restlessly around the room, forcing herself to move slowly, look at what was there.

Damn little, and what there was, stoutly built, was the discouraging answer. Sheâ€™d been given food, water for washing, a linen towel, and a hairbrush with which to tidy herself. She picked it up, assessing its potential as a weapon, then threw it down again.

The chimney stack rose through this room, but there was no open hearth. She thumped the bricks experimentally, and pried at the mortar with the end of the spoon theyâ€™d given her to eat with. She found one place where the mortar was cracked enough to pry, but a quarter of an hourâ€™s trying managed to dislodge only a few inches of mortar; the brick itself stayed firmly in place. Given a month or so, that might be worth a tryâ€”though the chances of someone her size managing to squeeze up an eighteenth-century flue . . .

It was getting up to rain; she heard the excited rattle of the palmetto leaves as the wind came through, sharp with the smell of rain. It was not quite sunset, but the clouds had darkened the sky so the room seemed dim. She had no candle; no one expected her to read or sew.

She threw her weight against the bars of the window for the dozenth time, and for the dozenth time found them solidly set and unyielding. Again, in a month, she might contrive to sharpen the spoonâ€™s end by grinding it against the chimney bricks, then use it as a chisel to chip away enough of the frame to dislodge one or two bars. But she didnâ€™t have a month.

Theyâ€™d taken away the fouled dress, and left her in shift and stays. Well, that was something. She pulled off the stays, and by picking at the ends of the stitching, extracted the buskâ€”a flat, twelve-inch strip of ivory that ran from sternum to navel. A better weapon than a hairbrush, she thought. She took it over to the chimney, and began to rasp the end against the brick, sharpening its point.

Could she stab someone with it? Oh, yes, she thought fiercely. And please let it be Emmanuel.





108




DAMN TALL




ROGER WAITED IN THE COVER of the thick bayberry bushes near the shore; a little way beyond, Ian and Jamie lay likewise in wait.

The second ship had arrived in the morning, coming to anchor a fastidious distance beyond the slaver. Sloshing nets over the side of Roarkeâ€™s ship in the guise of fishermen, they had been able to watch as first the captain of the slaver went ashore, and then, an hour later, a boat from the second ship was lowered and rowed ashore, with two menâ€”and a small chestâ€”in it.

â€œA gentleman,â€ Claire had reported, scanning them through the telescope. â€œWig, nicely dressed. The other manâ€™s a servant of some kindâ€”is the gentleman one of Bonnetâ€™s customers, do you think?â€

â€œI do,â€ Jamie had said, watching the boat pull to the shore. â€œTake us a bit to the north, if ye please, Mr. Roarke; weâ€™ll go ashore.â€

The three of them had landed half a mile from the beach and worked their way down through the wood, then took up their positions in the shrubbery and settled down to wait. The sun was hot, but so close to the shore, there was a fresh breeze, and it was not uncomfortable in the shade, bar the insects. For the hundredth time, Roger brushed away something crawling on his neck.

The waiting was making him jumpy. His skin itched with salt, and the scent of the tidal forest, with its peculiar mix of aromatic pine and distant seaweed, the crunch of shell and needle beneath his feet, brought back to him in vivid detail the day he had killed Lillington.

He had gone thenâ€”as nowâ€”with the intent of killing Stephen Bonnet. But the elusive pirate had been warned, and an ambush laid. It had been by the will of Godâ€”and the skill of Jamie Fraserâ€”that he hadnâ€™t left his own carcass in a similar forest, bones scattered by wild pigs, bleaching among the gleam of dry needles and the white of empty shells.

His throat was tight again, but he couldnâ€™t shout or sing to loosen it.

He should pray, he thought, but could not. Even the constant litany that had echoed through his heart since the night he had learned she was goneâ€”Lord, that she might be safeâ€”even that small petition had somehow dried up. His present thoughtâ€”Lord, that I might kill himâ€”he couldnâ€™t voice that, even to himself.

The deliberate intent and desire to murderâ€”surely he couldnâ€™t expect such a prayer to be heard.

For a moment, he envied Jamie and Ian their faith in gods of wrath and vengeance. While Roarke and Moses had brought the fishing boat in, he had heard Jamie murmur to Claire and take her hands in his. And heard her then bless him in the Gaelic, with the invocation to Michael of the red domain, the blessing of a warrior on his way to battle.

Ian had merely sat, cross-legged and silent, watching the shore draw nearer, his face remote. If he prayed, there was no telling to whom. When they landed, though, he had paused on the bank of one of the myriad inlets, and scooping up mud in his fingers, had carefully painted his face, drawing a line from forehead to chin, then four parallel streaks across his left cheek, a thick dark circle around his right eye. It was remarkably unsettling.

Quite obviously, neither of them had the slightest qualms about the business, nor the least hesitation in asking God to aid their efforts. He envied them.

And sat in stubborn silence, the gates of heaven closed against him, his hand on the hilt of his knife and a loaded pistol in his belt, planning murder.

A little past noon, the burly captain of the slaver came back, footsteps crunching indifferently on the layer of dried pine needles. They let him pass, waiting.

Late in the afternoon, it began to rain.



SHE HAD DOZED off again, from sheer boredom. It began to rain; the sound roused her briefly, then drove her more deeply into slumber, drops pattering softly on the palmetto thatch above. She woke abruptly when one of the drops fell cold on her face, followed quickly by a few of its fellows.

She jerked upright, blinking with momentary disorientation. She rubbed a hand over her face and looked up; there was a small wet patch on the plaster ceiling, surrounded by a much larger stain from previous leaks, and drops were forming in its center like magic, each perfect bead falling one after another after another to splat on the mattress ticking.

She got up to push the bed out from under the leak, and then stopped. Slowly she straightened up, and put up a hand to the wet patch. The ceiling was a normal one for the time, less than seven feet; she could reach it easily.

â€œShe damn tall,â€ she said aloud. â€œDamn right she is.â€

She put her hand flat on the wet patch and pushed as hard as she could. The wet plaster gave way at once, and so did the rotten laths behind it. She jerked back her hand, scratching her arm on the jagged edges of lath, and a small cascade of dirty water, centipedes, mouse droppings, and fragments of palmetto leaf poured in through the hole sheâ€™d made.

She wiped her hand on her shift, reached up, seized the edge of the hole, and pulled, ripping down chunks of lath and plaster, until sheâ€™d made a hole that would accommodate her head and shoulders.

â€œOkay,â€ she whispered to the baby, or herself. She glanced around the room, put on her stays over her shift, then tucked the sharpened busk down the front.

Then, standing on the bed, she took a deep breath, shoved her steepled hands upward as though about to dive, and grabbed for anything solid enough to provide leverage. Little by little, she hauled herself, sweating and grunting, up into the steaming thatch of sharp-edged leaves, teeth gritted and eyes closed against the dirt and dead insects.

Her head thrust into moist open air and she gasped for breath. She had an elbow hooked over a beam and, using that for leverage, pulled farther up. Her legs kicked vainly in empty air, trying to propel her upward, and she felt the wrench of shoulder muscles, but sheer desperation propelled her upwardâ€”that, and the nightmare vision of Emmanuel coming into the room and seeing the bottom half of her hanging out of the ceiling.

With a rending shower of leaves, she hauled herself out, to lie flat on the rain-wet thatch of the roof. The rain was still coming down heavily, and she was soaked in moments. A little way away, she saw some sort of structure sticking up amid the palmetto leaves of the thatch, and wriggled her way cautiously toward it, constantly fearful lest the roof give way beneath her weight, probing with hands and elbows for the firmness of the roof beams below the thatched leaves.

The structure proved to be a small platform, firmly set on the beams, with a railing on one side. She scrambled onto this and crouched, panting. It was still raining onshore, but out to sea, the sky was mostly clear, and the setting sun behind her spilled a burnt, bloody orange over sky and water through black streaks of shattered cloud. It looked like the end of the world, she thought, her ribs heaving against the lacing of her stays.

From the vantage point of the roof, she could see over the scrub forest; the slice of beach she had glimpsed from her window was clearly visibleâ€”and beyond it, two ships, lying close offshore.

Two boats were pulled up on shore, though well separated from each otherâ€”probably one from each ship, she thought. One of the ships must be the slaver, the other likely Howardâ€™s. A wash of humiliated rage ran over herâ€”she was surprised that the rain didnâ€™t steam off her skin. There was no time to dwell on that, though.

Voices came faintly through the patter of rain, and she ducked down, then realized that no one was likely to look up and see her. Raising her head to peer through the railing, she saw figures come out of the trees onto the beachâ€”a single file of chained men, with two or three guards.

â€œJosh!â€ She strained her eyes to see, but in the eerie twilight, the figures were no more than silhouettes. She thought she made out the tall, slender figures of the two Fulani menâ€”perhaps the shorter one behind them was Josh, but she couldnâ€™t tell.

Her fingers curled tight around the railing, impotent. She couldnâ€™t help, she knew it, but to be obliged simply to watch . . . As she watched, a thin scream came from the beach, and a smaller figure ran out of the wood, skirts flying. The guards turned, startled; one of them seized Phaedreâ€”it had to be her; Brianna could hear her screaming â€œJosh! Josh!â€, the sound of it harsh as the cry of a distant gull.

She was struggling with the guardâ€”some of the chained men turned abruptly, lunging at the other. A struggling knot of men fell to the sand. Someone was running toward them from the boat, something in his hand . . .

The vibration in her feet jerked her attention from the scene on the beach.

â€œCrap!â€ she said involuntarily. Emmanuelâ€™s head poked up over the edge of the roof, staring in disbelief. Then his face contorted, and he heaved himself upâ€”there must be a ladder attached to the side of the house, she thought, well, of course there would be, you wouldnâ€™t have a lookout platform and no way to get up to it. . . .

While her mind was busying itself with that nonsense, her body was taking more concrete steps. She had drawn the sharpened busk and was crouched against the platform, hand low as Ian had taught her.

Emmanuel made a derisive face at the thing in her hand and grabbed at her.



THEY COULD HEAR the gentleman coming well before they saw him. He was singing softly to himself, a French air of some kind. He was alone; the servant must have gone back to the ship while they were making their way through the woods.

Roger got softly to his feet, crouched behind his chosen bush. His limbs were stiff, and he stretched inconspicuously.

As the gentleman drew even with him, Jamie stepped out into the path in front of him. The manâ€”a small, foppish-looking sortâ€”uttered a girlish shriek of alarm. Before he could flee, though, Jamie had stepped forward and grasped his arm, smiling pleasantly.

â€œYour servant, sir,â€ he said courteously. â€œHave ye been calling upon Mr. Bonnet, by chance?â€

The man blinked at him, confused.

â€œBonnet? Why, why . . . yes.â€

Roger felt a tightness in his chest ease suddenly. Thank God. Theyâ€™d found the right place.

â€œWho are you, sir?â€ the small man was demanding, trying to draw his forearm out of Jamieâ€™s grip, to no avail.

There was no need to keep hidden now; Roger and Ian stepped out of the bushes, and the gentleman gasped at sight of Ian in his war paint, then glanced wildly back and forth between Jamie and Roger.

Evidently settling on Roger as the most civilized-looking person present, the gentleman appealed to him.

â€œI beg you, sirâ€”who are you, and what do you want?â€

â€œWe are in search of an abducted young woman,â€ Roger said. â€œA very tall young woman with red hair. Have youâ€”â€ Before he could finish, he saw the manâ€™s eyes dilate with panic. Jamie saw it, too, and twisted the manâ€™s wrist, sending him to his knees, mouth awry with pain.

â€œI think, sir,â€ Jamie said, with impeccable courtesy, holding tight, â€œwe must oblige you to tell us what ye know.â€



SHE COULDNâ€™T LET him get hold of her. That was her only conscious thought. He grabbed at her weaponless arm and she yanked free, skin slippery with rain, and struck at him in the same motion. The point of the busk skidded up his arm, leaving a reddening furrow, but he ignored this and lunged at her. She fell backward over the railing, landing awkwardly on her hands and knees in the leaves, but he hadnâ€™t got her; heâ€™d fallen on his own knees on the platform, with a thud that shook the whole roof.

She scrabbled madly to the edge of the roof, hands and knees poking randomly through the thatch, and threw her legs over the edge into space, kicking frantically for the rungs of the ladder.

He was after her, had her wrist in a grip like an eelâ€™s bite, was hauling her back onto the roof. She drew back her free hand and lashed him hard across the face with the busk. He roared and his grip loosened; she wrenched free and dropped.

She hit the sand flat on her back with a bone-shaking thump! and lay paralyzed, unable to breathe, the rain pelting down on her face. A hoot of triumph came from the roof, and then a growl of exasperated dismay. He thought heâ€™d killed her.

Great, she thought muzzily. Keep thinking that. The shock of impact was beginning to wear off, her diaphragm lurched into motion, and glorious air rushed into her lungs. Could she move?

She didnâ€™t know, and didnâ€™t dare to try. Through rain-clotted lashes, she saw Emmanuelâ€™s bulk ease over the edge of the roof, foot groping for the crude ladder rungs she could now see, nailed to the wall.

Sheâ€™d lost the busk when she fell, but saw it gleaming dully, a foot from her head. With Emmanuelâ€™s back momentarily turned, she whipped her hand up and grabbed it, then lay still, playing possum.



THEY HAD NEARLY reached the house when sounds from the nearby forest stopped them. Roger froze, then ducked off the path. Jamie and Ian had already melted into the wood. The sounds werenâ€™t coming from the path, though, but from somewhere off to the leftâ€”voices, menâ€™s voices, shouting orders, and the shuffling of feet, the clink of chains.

A thrill of panic shot through him. Were they taking her away? He was already soaked with rain, but felt the bloom of cold sweat over his body, colder than the rain.

Howard, the man theyâ€™d apprehended in the wood, had assured them Brianna was safe in the house, but what would he know? He listened, straining his ears for the sound of a womanâ€™s voice, and heard it, a high, thin scream.

He jerked toward it, only to find Jamie beside him, gripping his arm.

â€œThatâ€™s not Brianna,â€ his father-in-law said urgently. â€œIan will go. You and Iâ€”for the house!â€

There was no time for argument. The sounds of violence on the beach came faintlyâ€”shouts and criesâ€”but Jamie was right, that voice wasnâ€™t Briannaâ€™s. Ian was running toward the beach, making no effort now to be silent.

An instantâ€™s hesitation, instinct urging him to go after Ian, then Roger was on the path, following Jamie toward the house at the run.



EMMANUEL BENT OVER HER; she felt his bulk and lunged upward like a striking snake, sharpened busk like a fang. Sheâ€™d aimed for his head, hoping for eye or throat, but counting at least on his jerking reflexively back, putting him at a disadvantage.

He jerked, all right, up and away, but was much faster than sheâ€™d thought. She struck with all her force, and the sharpened busk drove under his arm with a rubbery shock. He froze for a moment, mouth open in incredulity, looking at the ivory rod that stuck out of his armpit. Then he wrenched it out, and lunged for her with an outraged bellow.

She was already on her feet, though, and running for the woods. From somewhere ahead, she heard more yellingâ€”and a bloodcurdling scream. Another, and then more, these coming from the front of the house.

Dazed and terrified, she kept running, her mind only slowly grasping that some of the screams had words.

â€œCasteal DHUUUUUUUIN!â€

Da, she thought, in absolute astonishment, then tripped over a branch on the ground and fell arse over teakettle, landing in a disheveled heap.

She struggled to her feet, thinking absurdly, This canâ€™t be good for the baby, and groping for another weapon.

Her fingers were trembling, wouldnâ€™t work. She scrabbled the ground, vainly. Then Emmanuel popped up beside her like the Demon King, grabbing her arm with a gloating, â€œHA!â€

The shock made her sway, her vision going gray at the edges. She could still hear bloodcurdling screams on the distant beach, but no more yelling at the house. Emmanuel was saying something, full of satisfaction and threat, but she wasnâ€™t listening.

There seemed to be something wrong with his face; it went in and out of focus, and she blinked hard, shaking her head to clear her sight. It wasnâ€™t her eyes, thoughâ€”it was him. His face melted slowly from bare-toothed menace to a look of faint astonishment. He frowned, lips pursing so she saw the pink lining of his mouth, and blinked two or three times. Then he made a small choked noise, put a hand to his chest, and dropped to his knees, still gripping her arm.

He fell over, and she landed on top of him. She pulled awayâ€”his fingers came away easily, all their strength suddenly goneâ€”and stumbled to her feet, panting and shaking.

Emmanuel was lying on his back, legs bent under him at what would have been an excruciating angle, had he been alive. She gulped for air, trembling, afraid to believe it. But he was dead; there was no mistaking the look of it.

Her breath was coming better now, and she began to be conscious of the cuts and bruises on her bare feet. She still felt stunned, unable to decide what to do next.

The decision was made for her in the next instant, as Stephen Bonnet came dashing toward her through the wood.



SHE JERKED TO instant alertness, and spun on her heel to flee. She made it no more than six paces before he had an arm about her throat, dragging her off her feet.

â€œHush, now, darlinâ€™,â€ he said in her ear, sounding breathless. He was hot, and his stubble rasped her cheek. â€œI mean ye no harm. Iâ€™ll leave ye safe on the shore. But yeâ€™re the only thing Iâ€™ve got right now will keep your men from killinâ€™ me.â€

He ignored the body of Emmanuel entirely. The heavy forearm left her throat and he grabbed her arm, trying to drag her in the direction away from the beachâ€”evidently, he meant to make for the hidden inlet on the opposite side of the island, where they had landed the day before. â€œMove, darlinâ€™. Now.â€

â€œLet go!â€ She dug her feet in hard, yanking on her trapped arm. â€œIâ€™m not going anywhere with you. HELP!â€ she shrieked as loudly as she could. â€œHELP! ROGER!â€

He looked startled, and raised his free arm to wipe the streaming rain out of his eyes. There was something in his hand; the last of the light gleamed orange on glass. Holy Lord, heâ€™d brought his testicle.

â€œBree! Brianna! Where are you?â€ Rogerâ€™s voice, frantic, and a jolt of adrenaline shot through her at the sound, giving her the strength to jerk her arm from Bonnetâ€™s grasp.

â€œHere! Here I am! Roger!â€ she shouted at the top of her voice.

Bonnet glanced over his shoulder; the bushes were shaking, two men at least coming through them. He wasted no time, but darted into the forest, bending low to avoid a branch, and was gone.

In the next instant, Roger crashed out of the brush and seized her, crushing her against him.

â€œYouâ€™re all right? Has he hurt you?â€ Heâ€™d dropped his knife, and held her by the arms, eyes trying to look everywhere at onceâ€”her face, her body, into her eyes. . . .

â€œIâ€™m fine,â€ she said, feeling dizzy. â€œRoger, Iâ€™mâ€”â€

â€œWhere has he gone?â€ It was her father, soaking wet and grim as death, dirk in his hand.

â€œThatâ€”â€ She turned to point, but he was already gone, running wolflike. She saw the marks of Bonnetâ€™s passage now, the scuffed footmarks clear in the muddy sand. Before she could turn round again, Roger was after him.

â€œWait!â€ she shrieked, but no answer came save the rapidly receding rustle of brush as heavy bodies flung themselves heedlessly through.

She stood still for a moment, head hanging as she breathed. The rain was pooling in the sockets of Emmanuelâ€™s open eyes; the orange light glowed in them, making them look like the eyes of a Japanese movie monster.

That random thought passed across her mind, then vanished, leaving her blank and numb. She wasnâ€™t sure what to do at this point. There were no sounds from the beach anymore; the noises of Bonnetâ€™s flight had long since faded.

The rain was still falling, but the last of the sun shone through the wood, the long rays nearly horizontal, filling the space between the shadows with an odd, shifting light that seemed to waver as she watched, as though the world around her were about to disappear.

In the midst of it, dreamlike, she saw the women appear, the Fulani twins. They turned the identical faces of fawns to her, huge eyes black with fear, and ran into the wood. She called out to them, but they disappeared. Feeling unutterably tired, she trudged after them.

She didnâ€™t find them. Nor was there a sign of anyone else. The light began to die, and she turned back, limping, toward the house. She ached everywhere, and began to suffer from the illusion that there was no one left in the world but her. Nothing but the burning light, fading to ashes moment by moment.

Then she remembered the baby in her womb, and felt better. No matter what, she wasnâ€™t alone. Nonetheless, she gave a wide berth to the place where she thought Emmanuelâ€™s body lay. She had meant to circle back toward the house, but went too far. As she turned to go back, she caught a glimpse of them, standing together in the shelter of the trees on the other side of a stream.

The wild horses, tranquil as the trees around them, flanks gleaming bay and chestnut and black with the wet. They raised their heads, scenting her, but didnâ€™t run, only stood regarding her with big, gentle eyes.



THE RAIN HAD stopped when she reached the house. Ian sat on the stoop, wringing water out of his long hair.

â€œYou have mud on your face, Ian,â€ she said, sinking down beside him.

â€œOh, have I?â€ he said, giving her a half-smile. â€œHow is it, then, coz?â€

â€œOh. Iâ€™m . . . I think Iâ€™m fine. Whatâ€”?â€ She gestured at his shirt, stained with watery blood. Something seemed to have hit him in the face; besides the smudges of mud, his nose was puffed, there was a swelling just above his brow, and his clothes were torn, as well as wet.

He drew a deep, deep breath and sighed, as though he were as tired as she was.

â€œI got back the wee black lass,â€ he said. â€œPhaedre.â€

That pierced the dreamlike fugue that filled her mind, but only a little.

â€œPhaedre,â€ she said, the name feeling like that of someone she had once known, long ago. â€œIs she all right? Whereâ€”â€

â€œIn there.â€ Ian nodded back toward the house, and she became aware that what she had thought the sound of the sea was in fact someone weeping, the small sobs of someone who has already wept herself to exhaustion, but cannot stop.

â€œNay, leave her to herself, coz.â€ Ianâ€™s hand on her arm stopped her from rising. â€œYe canna help.â€

â€œButâ€”â€

He stopped her, reaching into his shirt. From around his neck, he took a battered wooden rosary, and handed it to her.

â€œSheâ€™ll maybe want thisâ€”later. I picked it up from the sand, after the ship . . . left.â€

For the first time since her escape, the nausea was back, a sense of vertigo that threatened to pull her down into blackness.

â€œJosh,â€ she whispered. Ian nodded silently, though it hadnâ€™t been a question.

â€œIâ€™m sorry, coz,â€ he said very softly.



IT WAS NEARLY DARK when Roger appeared at the edge of the wood. She hadnâ€™t been worrying, only because she was in a state of shock too deep even to think of what was happening. At sight of him, though, she was on her feet and flying toward him, all the fears she had suppressed erupting at last into tears, running down her face like the rain.

â€œDa,â€ she said, choking and sniffling into his wet shirt. â€œHeâ€™sâ€”is heâ€”â€

â€œHeâ€™s all right. Breeâ€”can ye come with me? Are ye strong enoughâ€”just for a bit?â€

Gulping and wiping her nose on the soggy arm of her shift, she nodded, and leaning on his arm, limped into the darkness under the trees.

Bonnet was lying against a tree, head lolling to one side. There was blood on his face, running down onto his shirt. She felt no sense of victory at sight of him, only an infinitely weary distaste.

Her father was standing silently under the same tree. When he saw her, he stepped forward and folded her wordlessly into his arms. She closed her eyes for one blissful moment, wanting nothing more than to abandon everything, let him pick her up like a child and carry her home. But they had brought her here for a reason; with immense effort, she lifted her head and looked at Bonnet.

Did they want congratulations? she wondered fuzzily. But then she remembered what Roger had told her, describing her father leading her mother through the scene of butchery, making her look, so that she would know her tormentors were dead.

â€œOkay,â€ she said, swaying a little. â€œAll right, I mean. Iâ€”I see. Heâ€™s dead.â€

â€œWell . . . no. Actually, he isnâ€™t.â€ Rogerâ€™s voice held an odd note of strain, and he coughed, with a look that shot daggers at her father.

â€œDâ€™ye want him dead, lass?â€ Her father touched her shoulder, gently. â€œIt is your right.â€

â€œDo Iâ€”â€ She looked wildly from one to the other of the grave, shadowed faces, then at Bonnet, realizing for the first time that blood was running down his face. Dead men, as her mother had often explained, donâ€™t bleed.

They had found Bonnet, Jamie said, run him to earth like a fox, and set about him. It had been an ugly fight, close-to, with knives, as their pistols were useless in the wet. Knowing that he fought for his life, Bonnet had struck viciouslyâ€”there was a red-stained gash in the shoulder of Jamieâ€™s coat, a scratch high on Rogerâ€™s throat, where a knife blade had passed within a fraction of slashing his jugular. But Bonnet had fought to escape, and not to killâ€”retreating into a space between trees where only one could come at him, he had grappled with Jamie, thrown him off, then bolted.

Roger had given chase, and boiling with adrenaline, had thrown himself at Bonnet bodily, knocking the pirate headfirst into the tree he now lay against.

â€œSo there he lies,â€ Jamie said, giving Bonnet a bleak eye. â€œI had hoped heâ€™d broken his neck, but no such thing, alas.â€

â€œBut he is unconscious,â€ Roger said, and swallowed.

She understood, and in her present mood, this particular male quirk of honor seemed reasonable. To kill a man in fair fightâ€”or even an unfair fightâ€”was one thing; to cut his throat while he lay unconscious at your feet was another.

But she hadnâ€™t understood at all. Her father wiped his dirk on his breeches and handed it to her, hilt first.

â€œWhat . . . me?â€ She was too shocked even to feel astonishment. The knife was heavy in her hand.

â€œIf ye wish it,â€ her father said, with grave courtesy. â€œIf not, Roger Mac or I will do it. But it is your choice, a nighean.â€

Now she understood Rogerâ€™s lookâ€”they had been arguing about it, before he had come to fetch her. And she understood exactly why her father offered her the choice. Whether it was vengeance or forgiveness, she held the manâ€™s life in her hand. She took a deep breath, the awareness that it would not be vengeance coming over her with something like relief.

â€œBrianna,â€ Roger said softly, touching her arm. â€œSay the word if yeâ€™ll have him dead; Iâ€™ll do it.â€

She nodded, and took a deep breath. She could hear the savage longing in his voiceâ€”he did. She could hear the choked sound of his voice in memory, too, when he had told her of killing Bobleâ€”when he woke from dreams of it, drenched in sweat.

She glanced at her fatherâ€™s face, nearly drowned in shadow. Her mother had said only a little of the violent dreams that haunted him since Cullodenâ€”but that little was enough. She could hardly ask her father to do thisâ€”to spare Roger what he suffered himself.

Jamie raised his head, feeling her eyes on him, and met her gaze, straight on. Jamie Fraser had never turned from a fight he saw as hisâ€”but this was not his fight, and he knew it. She had a sudden flash of awareness; it wasnâ€™t Rogerâ€™s fight, either, though he would take the weight of it from her shoulders, and gladly.

â€œIf youâ€”if weâ€”if we donâ€™t kill him here and nowâ€”â€ Her chest was tight, and she stopped for breath. â€œWhat will we do with him?â€

â€œTake him to Wilmington,â€ her father said matter-of-factly. â€œThe Committee of Safety there is strong, and they know him for a pirate; theyâ€™ll deal with him by lawâ€”or what passes for it now.â€

Theyâ€™d hang him; he would be just as deadâ€”but his blood wouldnâ€™t be on Rogerâ€™s hands, or in his heart.

The light was gone. Bonnet was no more than a lumpen shape, dark against the sandy ground. He might die of his wounds, she thought, and dimly hoped soâ€”it would save trouble. But if they took him to her mother, Claire would be compelled to try to save him. She never turned from a fight that was hers, either, Brianna thought wryly, and was surprised to feel a small lightening of spirit at the thought.

â€œLet him live to be hanged, then,â€ she said quietly, and touched Rogerâ€™s arm. â€œNot for his sake. For yours and mine. For your baby.â€

For an instant, she was sorry that sheâ€™d told him now, in the night-dark wood. She would so much have liked to see his face.

THE SMELL OF LIGHT




October 2, 1775

IT WAS NOT THINKABLE TO RETURN Phaedre to River Run, even though she technically remained the property of Duncan Cameron. We had discussed the matter at some length, and finally decided not to tell Jocasta that her slave had been recovered, though we did send brief word with Ian, when he went to collect Jemmy, telling of Briannaâ€™s safe return and regretting the loss of Joshuaâ€”omitting a good bit of detail regarding the whole affair.

â€œShould we tell them about Neil Forbes?â€ Iâ€™d asked, but Jamie had shaken his head.

â€œForbes willna trouble any member of my family again,â€ he said definitely. â€œAnd to tell my aunt or Duncan about it . . . I think Duncan has sufficient trouble on his hands; heâ€™d feel obliged to take issue wiâ€™ Forbes, and thatâ€™s a stramash he doesna need to start just now. As for my aunt . . .â€ He didnâ€™t complete the statement, but the bleakness of his countenance spoke well enough. The MacKenzies of Leoch were a vengeful lot, and neither he nor I would put it past Jocasta to invite Neil Forbes to dinner and poison him.

â€œAlways assuming that Mr. Forbes is accepting dinner invitations these days,â€ I joked uneasily. â€œDo you know what Ian did with the . . . er . . .â€

â€œHe said he was going to feed it to his dog,â€ Jamie replied thoughtfully. â€œBut I dinna ken was he serious or not.â€

Phaedre had been a good deal shocked, both by her experiences and by the loss of Josh, and Brianna insisted that we bring her back to the Ridge with us to recover, until we could find a reasonable place for her.

â€œWe have to get Aunt Jocasta to free her,â€ Bree had argued.

â€œI think that willna be difficult,â€ Jamie had assured her with a certain grimness. â€œNot knowing what we know. But wait a bit, until we find a place for the lassâ€”then Iâ€™ll see to it.â€

As it was, that particular matter took care of itself with stunning abruptness.

I opened the door to a knock one afternoon in October, to find three weary horses and a pack mule in the dooryard, and Jocasta, Duncan, and the black butler Ulysses standing on the stoop.

The sight of them was so utterly incongruous that I merely stood there gaping at them, until Jocasta said acerbically, â€œWeel, lass, dâ€™ye mean us to stand here until weâ€™re melted away like sugar in a dish oâ€™ tea?â€

It was in fact raining quite hard, and I stepped back so quickly to let them in that I trod on Adsoâ€™s paw. He uttered a piercing yowl, which brought Jamie out of his study, Mrs. Bug and Amy from the kitchenâ€”and Phaedre out of the surgery, where she had been grinding herbs for me.

â€œPhaedre!â€ Duncanâ€™s jaw dropped, and he took two steps toward her. He stopped abruptly, just before taking her into his arms, but his face suffused with joy.

â€œPhaedre?â€ said Jocasta, sounding utterly astounded. Her face had gone quite blank with shock.

Ulysses said nothing, but the look on his face was one of unalloyed horror. Within a second, it was gone, replaced by his usual austere expression of dignity, but Iâ€™d seen itâ€”and kept a narrow eye on him during the ensuing confusion of exclamations and embarrassments.

Finally, I got them all out of the front hall. Jocasta suffered a diplomatic headacheâ€”though seeing her drawn face, I thought it wasnâ€™t entirely feignedâ€”and was escorted upstairs by Amy, who put her to bed with a cold compress. Mrs. Bug went back to the kitchen, excitedly revising the supper menu. Phaedre, looking frightened, disappeared, doubtless to take refuge in Briannaâ€™s cabin and tell her all about the unexpected arrivalâ€”which meant there would be another three for supper.

Ulysses went to deal with the horses, leaving Duncan at last alone to explain matters to Jamie in the study.

â€œWe are emigrating to Canada,â€ he said, closing his eyes and inhaling the aroma of the glass of whisky in his hand as though it were smelling salts. He looked like he needed them; he was gaunt, and his face was nearly as gray as his hair.

â€œCanada?â€ Jamie said, as surprised as I was. â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, Duncan, what have ye been doing?â€

Duncan smiled wearily, opening his eyes.

â€œMore what I didna do, Mac Dubh,â€ he said. Brianna had told us about the disappearance of the secret hoard of gold, and had mentioned something about Duncanâ€™s dealings with Lord Dunsmore in Virginia, but had been vague about itâ€”understandably so, as she had been kidnapped a few hours afterward, and had no details.

â€œI should never haâ€™ believed matters could come to such a passâ€”nor sae quickly,â€ he said, shaking his head. Loyalists had gone suddenly from being a majority in the piedmont to being a threatened and frightened minority. Some folk had been literally chased from their homes, to take refuge skulking in swamps and woods; others had been beaten and badly injured.

â€œEven Farquard Campbell,â€ Duncan said, and rubbed a hand tiredly over his face. â€œThe Committee of Safety called him before them, on charges of being loyal to the Crown, and threatened to confiscate his plantation. He put up a great deal of money, pledged as surety for his good behavior, and they let him goâ€”but it was a near thing.â€

Near enough to have frightened Duncan badly. The debacle of the promised guns and powder had deprived him of any influence with the local Loyalists and left him completely isolated, vulnerable to the next wave of hostilitiesâ€”which any fool could see would not be long in coming.

He had therefore moved swiftly to sell River Run at a decent price, before it was seized. He had kept one or two warehouses on the river and a few other assets, but had disposed of the plantation, slaves, and livestock, and proposed to remove at once with his wife to Canada, as many other Loyalists were doing.

â€œHamish MacKenzie is there, ken,â€ he explained. â€œHe and some others from Leoch settled in Nova Scotia, when they left Scotland in the wake of Culloden. Heâ€™s Jocastaâ€™s nephew, and weâ€™ve money enoughâ€”â€ He glanced vaguely toward the hall, where Ulysses had dumped the saddlebags. â€œHeâ€™ll help us to find a place.â€

He smiled crookedly.

â€œAnd if things shouldna turn out well . . . they do say the fishingâ€™s good.â€

Jamie smiled at the feeble joke, and poured him more whisky, but he shook his head when he came to join me in the surgery, before dinner.

â€œThey mean to travel overland to Virginia, and with luck take ship there for Nova Scotia. They can perhaps get out of Newport News; itâ€™s a small port, and the British blockade isna tight thereâ€”or so Duncan hopes.â€

â€œOh, dear.â€ It would be a grueling journeyâ€”and Jocasta was not a young woman. And the state of her eye . . . I was not fond of Jocasta, in light of what we had learned about her recently, but to think of her ripped from her home, forced to emigrate while suffering excruciating painâ€”well, it caused one to think there might be such a thing as divine retribution, after all.

I lowered my voice, looking over my shoulder to be sure Duncan had in fact gone upstairs. â€œWhat about Ulysses? And Phaedre?â€

Jamieâ€™s lips pressed tight.

â€œAh. Well, as to the lassâ€”I asked Duncan to sell her to me. I shall set her free as quickly as I can; perhaps send her to Fergus, in New Bern. He agreed at once, and wrote out a bill of sale on the spot.â€ He nodded toward his office. â€œAs for Ulysses . . .â€ His face was grim. â€œI think that matter will adjust itself, Sassenach.â€

Mrs. Bug came bustling down the hall to announce that the supper was served, and I had no chance to ask him what he meant by that remark.



I SQUEEZED OUT the poultice of witch hazel and Carolina allspice, and laid it gently over Jocastaâ€™s eyes. Iâ€™d already given her willow-bark tea for the pain, and the poultice would do nothing for the underlying glaucomaâ€”but it would be soothing, at least, and it was a relief to both patient and physician to be able to offer something, even though that might be the merest palliative.

â€œWill ye have a keek in my saddlebags, lass?â€ she asked, stretching a little to ease herself on the bed. â€œThereâ€™s a bittie parcel in there of an herb ye might find of interest.â€

I found it immediatelyâ€”by smell.

â€œWhere on earth did you get that?â€ I asked, halfway amused.

â€œFarquard Campbell,â€ she replied matter-of-factly. â€œWhen ye told me what the difficulty was with my eyes, I asked Fentiman if he kent anything that might be of help, and he told me that heâ€™d heard somewhere that hemp might be of use. Farquard Campbell has a field of it under cultivation, so I thought I might as well try it. It does seem to help. Would ye put it in my hand, please, niece?â€

Fascinated, I put the parcel of hemp and the little stack of papers down on the table beside her, and guided her hand to it. Rolling carefully onto her side to prevent the poultice falling off, she took a good pinch of aromatic herb, sprinkled it down the center of the paper, and rolled as tidy a joint as I had ever seen in Boston.

Without comment, I held the candle flame for her to light it, and she eased herself back on the pillow, nostrils flaring as she took a deep lungful of smoke.

She smoked in silence for some time, and I busied myself in putting things away, not wanting to leave her lest she fall asleep and set the bed on fireâ€”she was clearly exhausted, and relaxing further by the moment.

The pungent, heady smell of the smoke brought back instant, though fragmentary memories. Several of the younger medical students had smoked it on weekends, and would come to the hospital with the scent of it in their clothes. Some of the people brought into the emergency room had reeked of it. Now and then, Iâ€™d smelled the faintest hint of it on Briannaâ€”but never inquired.

I hadnâ€™t ever tried it, myself, but now found the smell of the fragrant smoke rather soothing. Rather too soothing, and I went and sat down by the window, open a crack to admit fresh air.

It had been raining off and on all day, and the air was sharp with ozone and tree resins, welcomely cold against my face.

â€œYe know, donâ€™t you?â€ Jocastaâ€™s voice came softly from behind me. I looked round; she hadnâ€™t moved, but lay like a tomb figure on the bed, straight as a die. The poultice bandage over her eyes made her look like the image of Justiceâ€”ironic, that, I thought.

â€œI know,â€ I said, matching her own calm tone. â€œNot very fair to Duncan, was it?â€

â€œNo.â€ The word drifted out with the smoke, almost soundless. She lifted the cigarette lazily and drew air through it, making the end glow red. I kept a narrow eye, but she seemed to have a feel for the ash, tapping it now and then into the saucer base of the candlestick.

â€œHe knows, too,â€ she said, almost casually. â€œAbout Phaedre. I told him, finally, to stop him searching for her. I am sure he knows about Ulysses, tooâ€”but he doesna speak of it.â€

She reached out, unerring, and tapped the ash neatly from the joint.

â€œI told him I wouldna blame him if he left me, ken.â€ Her voice was very soft, nearly without emotion. â€œHe wept, but then he stopped, and said to me that he had said, â€˜For better or for worseâ€™â€”and so had I, had I not? I said I had, and he said, â€˜Well, then.â€™ And here we are.â€ She shrugged a little, settling herself more comfortably, and fell silent, smoking.

I turned my face again to the window and leaned my forehead against the frame. Below, I saw a sudden spill of light as the door opened, and a dark figure came quickly out. The door closed, and I lost sight of him in the darkness for an instant; then my eyes adapted and I saw him again, just before he vanished on the path to the barn.

â€œHeâ€™s gone, isnâ€™t he?â€ Startled, I turned round to look at her, realizing that she must have heard the closing of the door below.

â€œUlysses? Yes, I think so.â€

She was still for quite a while, the cigarette burning unregarded in her hand. Just before I thought I must rise and take it from her, she lifted it again to her lips.

â€œHis true name was Joseph,â€ she said softly, releasing the smoke. Wisps of it swirled slowly in a cloud around her head. â€œSo appropriate, I always thoughtâ€”for he was sold into slavery by his own people.â€

â€œHave you ever seen his face?â€ I asked suddenly. She shook her head, and ground out the last of the cigarette.

â€œNay, but I kent him always,â€ she said very softly. â€œHe smelled of light.â€



JAMIE FRASER sat patiently in the darkness of his barn. It was a small one, with stallage for only half a dozen animals, but soundly built. Rain beat solidly on the roof, and wind whined like a ban-sidhe round the corners, but not a drip came through the shingled roof, and the air inside was warm with the heat of somnolent beasts. Even Gideon was a-nod over his manger, half-chewed hay hanging from the corner of his mouth.

It was past midnight now, and he had been waiting for more than two hours, the pistol loaded and primed, resting on his knee.

There it was; above the rain, he heard the soft grunt of someone pushing at the door, and the rumble as it slid open, admitting a breath of cold rain to mingle with the warmer scents of hay and manure.

He sat still, not moving.

He could see a tall form pause against the lighter black of the rain-drenched night, waiting for his eyes to adapt to the dark within, then throw his weight against the heavy door to open it enough to slip inside.

The man had brought a dark-lantern, not trusting that he could find the necessary bits of harness and apply them in the dark. He drew back the slide and turned the lantern slowly, letting the shaft of light travel over the stalls, one by one. The three horses Jocasta had brought were here, but done in. Jamie heard the man click his tongue softly in consideration, turning the light back and forth between the mare, Jerusha, and Gideon.

Making up his mind, Ulysses set the lantern on the floor, and made to pull the pin fastening the door to Gideonâ€™s stall.

â€œIt would serve ye right, and I let ye take him,â€ Jamie said conversationally.

The butler let out a sharp yelp and whirled round, glaring, his fists clenched. He couldnâ€™t see Jamie in the dark, but the evidence of his ears caught up with him a second later, and he breathed deeply and lowered his fists, realizing who it was.

â€œMr. Fraser,â€ he said. His eyes were live in the lantern light, and watchful. â€œYou took me by surprise.â€

â€œWell, I did intend to,â€ Jamie replied equably. â€œYe mean to be off, I suppose.â€

He could see thoughts flit through the butlerâ€™s eyes, quick as dragonflies, wondering, calculating. But Ulysses was no fool, and came to the correct conclusion.

â€œThe girlâ€™s told you, then,â€ he said, quite calmly. â€œShall you kill meâ€”for your auntâ€™s honor?â€ Had that last been said with any trace of a sneer, Jamie might have killed him indeedâ€”heâ€™d been of two minds on the matter while he waited. But it was said simply, and Jamieâ€™s finger eased on the trigger.

â€œIf I were a younger man, I would,â€ he said, matching Ulyssesâ€™s tone. And if I did not have a wife and daughter who once called a black man friend.

â€œAs it is,â€ he went on, lowering the pistol, â€œI try not to kill these days unless I must.â€ Or until I must. â€œDo ye offer me denial? For I think there can be nay defense.â€

The butler shook his head slightly. The light gleamed on his skin, dark, with a reddish undertone that made him look as though carved from aged cinnabar.

â€œI loved her,â€ he said softly, and spread his hands. â€œKill me.â€ He was dressed for traveling, in cloak and hat, with a pouch and canteen hung at his belt, but no knife. Slaves, even trusted ones, dared not go armed.

Curiosity warred with distaste, andâ€”as usual in such warfareâ€”curiosity won.

â€œPhaedre said ye lay with my aunt, even before her husband died. Is that true?â€

â€œIt is,â€ Ulysses said softly, his expression unreadable. â€œI do not justify it. I cannot. But I loved her, and if I must die for that . . .â€

Jamie believed the man; his sincerity was evident in voice and gesture. And knowing his aunt as he did, he was less inclined to blame Ulysses than the world at large would be. At the same time, he was not letting down his guard; Ulysses was good-size, and quick. And a man who thought he had nothing to lose was very dangerous indeed.

â€œWhere did ye mean to go?â€ he asked with a nod toward the horses.

â€œVirginia,â€ the black man replied with a barely perceptible hesitation. â€œLord Dunsmore has offered freedom to any slave who will join his army.â€

He hadnâ€™t meant to ask, though it was a question that had raised itself in his mind from the moment he heard Phaedreâ€™s story. With this opening, though, he could not resist.

â€œWhy did she not free you?â€ he asked. â€œAfter Hector Cameron died?â€

â€œShe didâ€ was the surprising answer. The butler touched the breast of his coat. â€œShe wrote the papers of manumission nearly twenty years agoâ€”she said she could not bear to think that I came to her bed only because I must. But a request for manumission must be approved by the Assembly, you know. And if I had been openly freed, I could not have stayed to serve her as I did.â€ That was true enough; a freed slave was compelled to leave the colony within ten days or risk being enslaved again, by anyone who chose to take him; the vision of large gangs of free Negroes roaming the countryside was one that made the Council and Assembly shit themselves with fear.

The butler looked down for a moment, eyes hooded against the light.

â€œI could choose Joâ€”or freedom. I chose her.â€

â€œAye, verra romantic,â€ Jamie said with extreme drynessâ€”though in fact, he was not unaffected by the statement. Jocasta MacKenzie had married for duty, and duty againâ€”and he thought she had had little happiness in any of her marriages until finding some measure of contentment with Duncan. He was shocked at her choice, disapproving of her adultery, and very angry indeed at her deception of Duncan, but some part of himâ€”the MacKenzie part, doubtlessâ€”could not but admire her boldness in taking happiness where she could.

He sighed deeply. The rain was easing now; the thundering on the roof had dwindled to a soft pattering.

â€œWell, then. I have one question more.â€

Ulysses inclined his head gravely, in a gesture Jamie had seen a thousand times. At your service, sir, it saidâ€”and that was done with more irony than there was in anything the man had said.

â€œWhere is the gold?â€

Ulyssesâ€™s head jerked up, eyes wide with startlement. For the first time, Jamie felt a shred of doubt.

â€œYou think I took it?â€ the butler said incredulously. But then his mouth twisted to one side. â€œI suppose you would, after all.â€ He rubbed a hand under his nose, looking worried and unhappyâ€”as well he might, Jamie reflected.

They stood regarding each other in silence for some time, at an impasse. Jamie did not have the feeling that the other was attempting to deceive himâ€”and God knew the man was good at that, he thought cynically.

At last, Ulysses heaved his wide shoulders, and let them drop in helplessness.

â€œI cannot prove that I did not,â€ he said. â€œI can offer nothing save my word of honorâ€”and I am not entitled to have such a thing.â€ For the first time, bitterness rang in his voice.

Jamie suddenly felt very tired. The horses and mules had long since gone back to their drowse, and he wanted nothing so much as his own bed, and his wife beside him. He also wanted Ulysses to be gone, long before Duncan discovered his perfidy. And while Ulysses was patently the most obvious person to have taken the gold, the fact remained that he could have taken it anytime in the last twenty years, with a good deal less danger. Why now?

â€œWill ye swear on my auntâ€™s head?â€ he asked abruptly. Ulyssesâ€™s eyes were sharp, shining in the lantern light, but steady.

â€œYes,â€ he said at last, quietly. â€œI do so swear.â€

Jamie was about to dismiss him, when one last thought occurred to him.

â€œDo you have children?â€ he asked.

Indecision crossed the chiseled face; surprise and wariness, mingled with something else.

â€œNone I would claim,â€ he said at last, and Jamie saw what it wasâ€”scorn, mixed with shame. His jaw tensed, and his chin rose slightly. â€œWhy do you ask me that?â€

Jamie met his gaze for a moment, thinking of Brianna growing heavy with child.

â€œBecause,â€ he said at last, â€œit is only the hope of betterment for my children, and theirs, that gives me the courage to do what must be done here.â€ Ulyssesâ€™s face had gone blank; it gleamed black and impassive in the light.

â€œIf you have no stake in the future, you have no reason to suffer for it. Such children as you may haveâ€”â€

â€œThey are slaves, born of slave women. What can they be, to me?â€ Ulyssesâ€™s hands were clenched, pressed against his thighs.

â€œThen go,â€ Jamie said softly, and stood aside, gesturing toward the door with the barrel of his pistol. â€œDie free, at least.â€

JANUARY TWENTY-FIRST




January 21, 1776

JANUARY 21 WAS THE COLDEST DAY of the year. Snow had fallen a few days before, but now the air was like cut crystal, the dawn sky so pale it looked white, and the packed snow chirped like crickets under our boots. Snow, snow-shrouded trees, the icicles that hung from the eaves of the houseâ€”the whole world seemed blue with cold. All of the stock had been put up the night before in stable or barn, with the exception of the white sow, who appeared to be hibernating under the house.

I peered dubiously at the small, melted hole in the crust of snow that marked the sowâ€™s entrance; long, stertorous snores were audible inside, and a faint warmth emanated from the hole.

â€œCome along, mo nighean. Yon creature wouldna notice if the house fell down atop her.â€ Jamie had come down from feeding the animals in the stable, and was hovering impatiently behind me, chafing his hands in the big blue mittens Bree had knitted for him.

â€œWhat, not even if it was on fire?â€ I said, thinking of Lambâ€™s â€œEssay on Roast Pork.â€ But I turned obligingly to follow him down the trampled path past the side of the house, then slowly, slipping on the icy patches, across the wide clearing toward Bree and Rogerâ€™s cabin.

â€œYeâ€™re sure the hearth fireâ€™s out?â€ Jamie asked, for the third time. His breath wreathed round his head like a veil as he looked over his shoulder at me. He had lost his woolen cap hunting, and instead had a woolly white muffler wrapped around his ears and tied on top of his head, the long ends flopping, which made him look absurdly like an enormous rabbit.

â€œIt is,â€ I assured him, suppressing an urge to laugh at sight of him. His long nose was pink with cold, and twitched suspiciously, and I buried my face in my own muffler, making small snorting noises that emerged as puffs of white, like a steam engine.

â€œAnd the bedroom candle? The wee lamp in your surgery?â€

â€œYes,â€ I assured him, emerging from the depths of the muffler. My eyes were watering and I would have liked to wipe them, but I had a huge bundle in one arm and a covered basket hung on the other. This contained Adso, who had been forcibly removed from the house, and wasnâ€™t pleased about it; small growls emerged from the basket, and it swayed and thumped against my leg.

â€œAnd the rush dip in the pantry, and the candle in the wall sconce in the hall, and the brazier in your office, and the fish-oil lantern you use in the stables. I went over the whole house with a nit comb. Not a spark anywhere.â€

â€œWell enough, then,â€ he saidâ€”but couldnâ€™t help an uneasy glance backward at the house. I looked, too; it looked cold and forlorn, the white of its boards rather grimy against the pristine snow.

â€œIt wonâ€™t be an accident,â€ I said. â€œNot unless the white sow is playing with matches in her den.â€

That made him smile, in spite of the circumstances. Frankly, at the moment, the circumstances struck me as slightly absurd; the whole world seemed deserted, frozen solid and immobile under a winter sky. Nothing seemed less likely than that cataclysm could descend to destroy the house by fire. Still . . . better safe than sorry. And as Jamie had remarked more than once during the years since Roger and Bree had brought word of that sinister newspaper clipping, â€œIf ye ken the house is meant to burn down on a certain day, why would ye be standing in it?â€

So we werenâ€™t standing in it. Mrs. Bug had been told to stay at home, and Amy McCallum and her two little boys were already at Briannaâ€™s cabinâ€”puzzled, but obliging. If Himself said that no one was to set foot in the house until dawn tomorrow . . . well, then, there was nothing more to be said, was there?

Ian had been up since before dawn, chopping kindling and hauling in firewood from the shed; everyone would be snug and warm.

Jamie himself had been up all night, tending stock, dispersing his armoryâ€”there was not a grain of gunpowder anywhere in the house, eitherâ€”and prowling restlessly upstairs and down, alert to every cracking ember on a hearth, every burning candle flame, any faint noise without that might portend the approach of an enemy. The only thing he hadnâ€™t done was to sit on the roof with a wet sack, keeping a suspicious eye out for lightningâ€”and that, only because it had been a cloudless night, the stars immense and bright overhead, burning in the frozen void.

I hadnâ€™t slept a great deal, either, disturbed equally by Jamieâ€™s prowling and by vivid dreams of conflagration.

The only conflagration visible, though, was the one sending a welcome shower of smoke and sparks from Briannaâ€™s chimney, and we opened the door to the grateful warmth of a roaring hearth and a number of bodies.

Aidan and Orrie, roused in the dark and dragged through the cold, had promptly crawled into Jemmyâ€™s trundle, and the three little boys were sound asleep, curled up like hedgehogs beneath their quilt. Amy was helping Bree with the breakfast; savory smells of porridge and bacon rose from the hearth.

â€œIs all well, maâ€™am?â€ Amy hurried over to take the big bundle I had broughtâ€”this contained my medical chest, the more scarce and valuable herbs from my surgeryâ€”and the sealed jar with the latest shipment of white phosphorus that Lord John had sent as a farewell present to Brianna.

â€œIt is,â€ I assured her, setting Adsoâ€™s basket on the floor. I yawned, and eyed the bed wistfully, but set about to stow my chest in the lean-to pantry, where the children wouldnâ€™t get into it. I put the phosphorus on the highest shelf, well back from the edge, and moved a large cheese in front of it, just in case.

Jamie had divested himself of cloak and rabbit ears, and handing Roger the fowling piece, shot pouch, and powder horn heâ€™d carried, was stamping snow from his boots. I saw him glance round the cabin, counting heads, then, at last, draw a small breath, nodding to himself. All safe, so far.

The morning passed peacefully. Breakfast eaten and cleared away, Amy, Bree, and I settled down by the fire with an enormous heap of mending. Adso, tail still twitching with indignation, had taken up a place on a high shelf, from whence he glared at Rollo, who had taken over the trundle bed when the boys got out of it.

Aidan and Jemmy, each now the proud possessor of two vrooms, drove them over hearthstones, under the bed, and through our feet, but for the most part, refrained from punching each other or stepping on Orrie, who was sitting placidly under the table gnawing on a piece of toast. Jamie, Roger, and Ian took turns going outside to pace back and forth and stare at the Big House, deserted in the shelter of the snow-dusted spruce.

As Roger came back from one of these expeditions, Brianna looked up suddenly from the sock she was darning.

â€œWhat?â€ he said, seeing her face.

â€œOh.â€ She had paused, needle halfway through the sock, and now looked down, completing her stitch. â€œNothing. Just aâ€”just a thought.â€

The tone of her voice made Jamie, who had been frowning his way through a battered copy of Evelina, look up.

â€œWhat sort of thought was that, a nighean?â€ he asked, his radar quite as good as Rogerâ€™s.

â€œEr . . . well.â€ She bit her lower lip, but then blurted, â€œWhat if itâ€™s this house?â€

That froze everyone except the little boys, who continued crawling industriously around the room and over bed and table, screeching and vrooming.

â€œIt could be, couldnâ€™t it?â€ Bree looked round, from rooftree to hearth. â€œAll theâ€”the prophecy saidâ€â€”with an awkward nod toward Amy McCallumâ€”â€œwas the home of James Fraser would burn. But this was your home, to start with. And itâ€™s not like thereâ€™s a street address. It just said, On Fraserâ€™s Ridge.â€

Everyone stared at her, and she flushed deeply, dropping her eyes to the sock.

â€œI mean . . . itâ€™s not like theyâ€”er, propheciesâ€”like theyâ€™re always accurate, is it? They might have got the details wrong.â€

Amy nodded seriously; evidently, vagueness in the matter of detail was an accepted characteristic of prophecies.

Roger cleared his throat explosively; Jamie and Ian exchanged glances, then looked at the fire, leaping on the hearth and the towering stack of bone-dry firewood next to it, the overflowing kindling basket . . . Everyoneâ€™s eyes turned expectantly to Jamie, whose face was a study in conflicting emotions.

â€œI suppose,â€ he said slowly, â€œwe could remove to Archâ€™s place.â€

I began to count on my fingers: â€œYou, me, Roger, Bree, Ian, Amy, Aidan, Orrie, Jemmyâ€”plus Mr. and Mrs. Bugâ€”is eleven people. In a one-room cabin that measures eight feet by ten?â€ I closed my fists and stared at him. â€œNo one would have to set the place on fire; half of us would be sitting in the hearth already, well alight.â€

â€œMmphm. Well, then . . . the Christie place is empty.â€

Amyâ€™s eyes went round with horror, and everyone looked automatically away from everyone else. Jamie took a deep breath and let it out, audibly.

â€œPerhaps weâ€™ll just be . . . very careful,â€ I suggested. Everyone exhaled slightly, and we resumed our occupations, though without our former sense of snug safety.

Dinner passed without incident, but in midafternoon, a knock came on the door. Amy screamed, and Brianna dropped the shirt she was mending into the fire. Ian leaped to his feet and jerked the door open, and Rollo, jerked out of a doze, charged past him, roaring.

Jamie and Roger struck the doorwayâ€”and each otherâ€”simultaneously, stuck for an instant, and fell through. All the little boys shrieked and ran to their respective mothers, who were frantically beating at the smoldering shirt as though it were a live snake.

I had leaped to my feet, but was pressed against the wall, unable to get past Bree and Amy. Adso, startled by the racket and by my popping up beside him, hissed and took a swipe at me, narrowly missing my eye.

A number of oaths in a mixture of languages were coming from the dooryard, accompanied by a series of sharp barks from Rollo. Everyone sounded thoroughly annoyed, but there were no sounds of conflict. I edged my way delicately past the knot of mothers and sons, and peered out.

Major MacDonald, wet to the eyebrows and covered in clumps of snow and dirty slush, was gesticulating with some energy at Jamie, while Ian rebuked Rollo, and Rogerâ€”from the look on his faceâ€”was trying very hard not to burst out laughing.

Jamie, compelled by his own sense of propriety, but eyeing the Major with deep suspicion, invited him in. The inside of the cabin smelled of burned fabric, but at least the riot had calmed down, and the Major greeted us all with a fair assumption of cordiality. There was a lot of fuss, getting him stripped of his soaking-wet clothes, dried off, andâ€”for lack of any better alternativeâ€”temporarily swathed in Rogerâ€™s spare shirt and breeches, in which he appeared to be drowning, as he was a good six inches shorter than Roger.

Food and whisky having been ceremonially offered and accepted, the household fixed the Major with a collective eye and waited to hear what had brought him to the mountains in the dead of winter.

Jamie exchanged a brief glance with me, indicating that he could hazard a guess. So could I.

â€œI have come, sir,â€ MacDonald said formally, hitching up the shirt to keep it from sliding off his shoulder, â€œto offer ye command of a company of militia, under the orders of General Hugh MacDonald. The Generalâ€™s troops are gathering, even as we speak, and will undertake their march to Wilmington at the end of the month.â€

I felt a deep qualm of apprehension at that. I was accustomed to MacDonaldâ€™s chronic optimism and tendency to overstatement, but there was nothing of exaggeration in this statement. Did that mean that the help Governor Martin had requested, the troops from Ireland, would be landing soon, to meet General MacDonaldâ€™s troops at the coast?

â€œThe Generalâ€™s troops,â€ Jamie said, poking up the fire. He and MacDonald had taken over the fireside, with Roger and Ian ranged on either side of them, like firedogs. Bree, Amy, and I repaired to the bed, where we perched like a row of roosting hens, watching the conversation with a mingling of interest and alarm, while the little boys retired under the table.

â€œHow many men does he have, would ye say, Donald?â€

I saw MacDonald hesitate, torn between truth and desire. He coughed, though, and said matter-of-factly, â€œHe had a few more than a thousand when I left him. Ye ken weel, thoughâ€”once we begin to move, others will come to join us. Many others. The more particularly,â€ he added pointedly, â€œif such gentlemen as yourself are in command.â€

Jamie didnâ€™t reply to that at once. Meditatively, he shoved a burning wood fragment back into the fire with his foot.

â€œPowder and shot?â€ he asked. â€œArms?â€

â€œAye, well; weâ€™d a bit of a disappointment there.â€ MacDonald took a sip of his whisky. â€œDuncan Innes had promised us a great deal in that wayâ€”but in the end, he was obliged to renege upon his promise.â€ The Majorâ€™s lips pressed tight, and I thought from the expression on his face that perhaps Duncan had not been overreacting in his decision to move to Canada.

â€œStill,â€ MacDonald continued more cheerfully, â€œwe are not destitute in that regard. And those gallant gentlemen who have flocked to our causeâ€”and who will come to join usâ€”bring with them both their own weapons and their courage. You, of all people, must appreciate the force of the Hieland charge!â€

Jamie looked up at that, and regarded MacDonald for a long moment before replying.

â€œAye, well. Ye were behind the cannon at Culloden, Donald. I was in front of them. With a sword in my hand.â€ He took up his own glass and drained it, then got up and moved to pour another, leaving MacDonald to recover his countenance.

â€œTouchÃ©, Major,â€ Brianna murmured under her breath. I didnâ€™t think Jamie had ever before referred to the fact that the Major had fought with the government forces during the Risingâ€”but I wasnâ€™t surprised that he hadnâ€™t forgotten.

With a brief nod to the company, Jamie stepped outsideâ€”ostensibly to visit the privy, more likely to check on the well-being of the house. Still more likely to give MacDonald a little breathing room.

Roger, with the courtesy of a hostâ€”and the suppressed keenness of a historianâ€”was asking MacDonald questions regarding the General and his activities. Ian, impassive and watchful, sat by his feet, one hand toying with Rolloâ€™s ruff.

â€œThe Generalâ€™s rather elderly for such a campaign, surely?â€ Roger took another stick of wood and pushed it into the fire. â€œEspecially a winter campaign.â€

â€œHe has the odd wee spell of catarrh,â€ MacDonald admitted, offhand. â€œBut who doesna, in this climate? And Donald McLeod, his lieutenant, is a man of vigor. I assure ye, sir, should the General be at any point indisposed, Colonel McLeod is more than capable of leading the troops to victory!â€

He went on at some length about the virtuesâ€”both personal and militaryâ€”of Donald McLeod. I ceased listening, my attention distracted by a stealthy movement on the shelf above his head. Adso.

MacDonaldâ€™s red coat was spread over the back of a chair to dry, steaming in the heat. His wig, damp and disheveled from Rolloâ€™s attack, hung on the cloak peg above it. I got up hastily and possessed myself of the wig, receiving a look of puzzlement from the Major, and one of green-eyed hostility from Adso, who plainly considered it low of me to hog this desirable prey for myself.

â€œEr . . . Iâ€™ll just . . . um . . . put it somewhere safe, shall I?â€ Clutching the damp mass of horsehair to my bosom, I sidled outside and round to the pantry, where I tucked the wig safely away behind the cheese with the phosphorus.

Coming out, I met Jamie, red-nosed with cold, coming back from a reconnaissance of the Big House.

â€œAllâ€™s well,â€ he assured me. He glanced up at the chimney above us, spuming clouds of thick gray smoke. â€œYe dinna suppose the lass might be right, do ye?â€ He sounded as though he were joking, but he wasnâ€™t.

â€œGod knows. How long â€™til tomorrowâ€™s dawn?â€ The shadows were already falling long, violet and chill across the snow.

â€œToo long.â€ He had violet shadows in his face, too, from one sleepless night; this would be another. He hugged me against himself for a moment, though, warm in spite of the fact that he wore nothing over his shirt but the rough jacket in which he did chores.

â€œYe dinna suppose MacDonald will come back and fire the house, if I refuse him, do ye?â€ he asked, releasing me with a fair attempt at a smile.

â€œWhat do you mean â€˜ifâ€™?â€ I demanded, but he was already on his way back in.

MacDonald stood up in respect when Jamie came in, waiting until he was seated again before taking his own stool.

â€œHave ye had a moment, then, to think on my offer, Mr. Fraser?â€ he asked formally. â€œYour presence would be of the greatest valueâ€”and valued greatly by General MacDonald and the Governor, as well as myself.â€

Jamie sat silent for a moment, looking into the fire.

â€œIt grieves me, Donald, that we should find ourselves so opposed,â€ he said at last, looking up. â€œYe canna be in ignorance, though, of my position in this matter. I have declared myself.â€

MacDonald nodded, lips tightening a little.

â€œI ken what yeâ€™ve done. But it is not too late for remedy. Yeâ€™ve done nothing yet that is irrevocableâ€”and a man may surely admit mistake.â€

Jamieâ€™s mouth twitched a little.

â€œOh, aye, Donald. Might you admit your own mistake, then, and join the cause of liberty?â€

MacDonald drew himself up.

â€œIt may please ye to tease, Mr. Fraser,â€ he said, obviously keeping a grip on his temper, â€œbut my offer is made in earnest.â€

â€œI know that, Major. My apologies for undue levity. And also for the fact that I must make ye a poor reward of your efforts, coming so far in bitter weather.â€

â€œYe refuse, then?â€ Red smudges burned on MacDonaldâ€™s cheeks, and his pale blue eyes had gone the color of the winter sky. â€œYe will abandon your kin, your ain folk? Ye would betray your blood, as well as your oath?â€

Jamie had opened his mouth to reply, but stopped at this. I could feel something going on inside him. Shock, at this bluntâ€”and very accurateâ€”accusation? Hesitation? He had never discussed the situation in those terms, but he must have grasped them. Most of the Highlanders in the colony either had joined the Loyalist side alreadyâ€”like Duncan and Jocastaâ€”or likely would.

His declaration had cut him off from a great many friendsâ€”and might well cut him off from the remnants of his family in the New World, as well. Now MacDonald was holding out the apple of temptation, the call of clan and blood.

But he had had years to think of it, to ready himself.

â€œI have said what I must, Donald,â€ he said quietly. â€œI have pledged myself and my house to what I believe is right. I cannot do otherwise.â€

MacDonald sat for a moment, looking at him narrowly. Then, without a word, he stood and pulled Rogerâ€™s shirt off over his head. His torso was pale and lean, but with a slight middle-aged softness round the waist, and bore several white scars, the marks of bullet wounds and sabre cuts.

â€œYou donâ€™t mean to go, surely, Major? Itâ€™s freezing out, and nearly dark!â€ I came to stand by Jamie, and Roger and Bree rose, too, adding their protestations to mine. MacDonald, though, was obdurate, merely shaking his head as he pulled on his own damp clothing, fastening his coat with difficulty, as the buttonholes were stiff with damp.

â€œI will not take hospitality from the hand of a traitor, mum,â€ he said very quietly, and bowed to me. He straightened then, and met Jamieâ€™s eye, man to man.

â€œWe shall not meet again as friends, Mr. Fraser,â€ he said. â€œI regret it.â€

â€œThen let us hope we do not meet again at all, Major,â€ Jamie said. â€œI too regret it.â€

MacDonald bowed again, to the rest of the company, and clapped his hat on his head. His expression changed as he did so and felt the damp coldness of it on his bare head.

â€œOh, your wig! Just a moment, Majorâ€”Iâ€™ll fetch it.â€ I rushed out and round to the pantryâ€”just in time to hear a crash as something fell inside. I jerked open the door, left ajar from my last visit, and Adso streaked past me, the Majorâ€™s wig in his mouth. Inside, the lean-to was in brilliant blue flames.



I HAD INITIALLY wondered how I would keep awake all night. In the event, it wasnâ€™t difficult at all. In the aftermath of the blaze, I wasnâ€™t sure Iâ€™d ever sleep again.

It could have been much worse; Major MacDonald, in spite of now being a sworn enemy, had come nobly to our aid, rushing out and flinging his still-wet cloak over the blaze, thus preventing the total destruction of the pantryâ€”and, doubtless, the cabin. The cloak had not put out the fire entirely, though, and quenching the flames that sprang up here and there had entailed a great deal of excitement and rushing about, in the course of which Orrie McCallum was misplaced, toddled off, and fell into the groundhog kiln, where he was foundâ€”many frantic minutes laterâ€”by Rollo.

He was fished out undamaged, but the hullabaloo caused Brianna to have what she thought was premature labor. Fortunately, this proved to be merely a bad case of hiccups, caused by the combination of nervous strain and eating excessive quantities of sauerkraut and dried-apple pie, for which she had conceived a recent craving.

â€œFlammable, she said.â€ Jamie looked at the charred remains of the pantry floor, then at Brianna, who had, in spite of my recommendation that she lie down, come out to see what could be salvaged from the smoking remains. He shook his head. â€œItâ€™s a miracle that yeâ€™ve not burnt the place to ashes long since, lass.â€

She emitted a smothered â€œhic!â€ and glowered at him, one hand on her bulging stomach.

â€œMe? Youâ€™d better not be tryâ€”hic!â€”ing to make out that this is myâ€”hic!â€”fault. Did I put the Majorâ€™sâ€”hic!â€”wig next to theâ€”â€

â€œBOO!â€ Roger bellowed, darting a hand at her face.

She shrieked, and hit him. Jemmy and Aidan, running out to see what the commotion was about, started dancing round her, ecstatically shouting, â€œBoo! Boo!â€ like a gang of miniature lunatic ghosts.

Bree, her eyes gleaming dangerously, bent and scooped up a handful of snow. In an instant, she had molded it into a ball, which she flung at her husbandâ€™s head with deadly accuracy. It struck him right between the eyes, exploding in a shower that left white granules clinging to his eyebrows and melting globs of snow running down his cheeks.

â€œWhat?â€ he said incredulously. â€œWhatâ€™s that for? I was only trying toâ€”hey!â€ He ducked the next one, only to be pelted round the knees and waist by handsful of snow lobbed at short range by Jemmy and Aidan, quite berserk by now.

Modestly accepting thanks for his action earlier, the Major had been persuadedâ€”not least by the fact that it was now full dark and beginning to snow againâ€”to accept the hospitality of the cabin, with the understanding that it was Roger, not Jamie, who was offering it. Watching his hosts whooping and hiccing as they plastered one another with snow, he looked as though he might be having second thoughts about being so fine as to refuse to dine with a traitor, but he rather stiffly bowed in response when Jamie and I bade him farewell, then trudged into the cabin, the muddy shreds that Adso had left of his wig clasped in his hand.

It seemed extremelyâ€”and most gratefullyâ€”quiet as we made our way through the falling snow toward our own house, alone. The sky had gone a pinkish lavender, and the flakes floated down around us, supernatural in their silence.

The house loomed before us, its quiet bulk somehow welcoming, in spite of the darkened windows. Snow was swirling across the porch in little eddies, piling in drifts on the sills.

â€œI suppose it would be harder for a fire to start if itâ€™s snowingâ€”wouldnâ€™t you think?â€

Jamie bent to unlock the front door.

â€œI dinna much mind if the place bursts into flame by spontaneous combustion, Sassenach, provided I have my supper first.â€

â€œA cold supper, were you thinking?â€ I asked dubiously.

â€œI was not,â€ he said firmly. â€œI mean to light a roaring fire in the kitchen hearth, fry up a dozen eggs in butter, and eat them all, then lay ye down on the hearth rug and roger ye â€™til youâ€”is that all right?â€ he inquired, noticing my look.

â€œâ€™Til I what?â€ I asked, fascinated by his description of the eveningâ€™s program.

â€œâ€™Til ye burst into flame and take me with ye, I suppose,â€ he said, and stooping, swooped me up into his arms and carried me across the darkened threshold.

OATHBREAKER




February 2, 1776

HE CALLED THEM ALL TOGETHER, and they came. The Jacobites of Ardsmuir, the fishermen from Thurso, the outcasts and opportunists who had come to settle on the Ridge over the last six years. He had called for the men, and most came alone, making their way through the dripping woods, slipping on mossy rocks and muddy trails. Some of the wives came, as well, though, curious, wary, though they hung modestly back and allowed Claire to shepherd them into the house one by one.

The men stood in the dooryard, and he regretted that; the memory of the last time they had gathered here was much too fresh in everyoneâ€™s mind. But there was no choice about it; there were too many to fit in the house. And it was broad day, now, not nightâ€”though he saw more than one man turn his head sharply to glance at the chestnut trees, as though he saw the ghost of Thomas Christie there, poised once more to walk through the crowd.

He crossed himself, and said a hasty prayer, as he always did when he thought of Tom Christie, then stepped out on the porch. They had been talking togetherâ€”awkwardly, but with a fair assumption of easeâ€”but the talk died abruptly when he appeared.

â€œI have received word summoning me to Wilmington,â€ he said to them without preamble. â€œI go to join the militias there, and I will take with me such men as will come willingly.â€

They gaped at him like sheep disturbed at grazing. He had a momentâ€™s unsettling impulse to laugh, but it passed at once.

â€œWe will go as militia, but I do not command your service.â€ Privately, he doubted that he could command more than a handful of them now, but as well to put a good face on it.

Most were still blinking at him, but one or two had got a grip on themselves.

â€œYou declare yourself a rebel, Mac Dubh?â€ That was Murdo, bless him. Loyal as a dog, but slow of thought. He needed things to be put in the simplest of terms, but once grasped, he would deal with them tenaciously.

â€œAye, Murdo, I do. I am a rebel. So will any man be who marches with me.â€

That caused a fair degree of murmuring, glances of doubt. Here and there in the crowd, he heard the word â€œoath,â€ and steeled himself for the obvious question.

He was taken aback by the man who asked it, though. Arch Bug drew himself up, tall and stern.

â€œYe swore an oath to the King, Seaumais mac Brian,â€ he said, his voice unexpectedly sharp. â€œSo did we all.â€

There was a murmur of agreement at this, and faces turned to him, frowning, uneasy. He took a deep breath, and felt his stomach knot. Even now, knowing what he knew, and knowing too the immorality of a forced oath, to break his sworn word openly made him feel that he had stepped on a step that wasnâ€™t there.

â€œSo did we all,â€ he agreed. â€œBut it was an oath forced upon us as captives, not one given as men of honor.â€

This was patently true; still, it was an oath, and Highlanders did not take any oath lightly. May I die and be buried far from my kin . . . Oath or no, he thought grimly, that fate would likely be theirs.

â€œBut an oath nonetheless, sir,â€ said Hiram Crombie, lips drawn tight. â€œWe have sworn before God. Do you ask us to put aside such a thing?â€ Several of the Presbyterians murmured acquiescence, drawing closer to Crombie in show of support.

He took another deep breath, feeling his belly tighten.

â€œI ask nothing.â€ And knowing full well what he did, despising himself in a way for doing itâ€”he fell back upon the ancient weapons of rhetoric and idealism.

â€œI said that the oath of loyalty to the King was an oath extorted, not given. Such an oath is without power, for no man swears freely, save he is free himself.â€

No one shouted disagreement, so he went on, voice pitched to carry, but not shouting.

â€œYeâ€™ll ken the Declaration of Arbroath, will ye? Four hundred years since, it was our sires, our grandsires, who put their hands to these words: . . . for as long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule.â€ He stopped to steady his voice, then went on. â€œIt is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedomâ€”for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.â€

He stopped dead then. Not for its effect on the men to whom he spoke, but because of the words themselvesâ€”for in speaking them, he had found himself unexpectedly face to face with his own conscience.

To this point, he had been dubious about the justifications of the revolution, and more so of its ends; he had been compelled to the rebel stand because of what Claire, Brianna, and Roger Mac had told him. But in the speaking of the ancient words, he found the conviction he thought he pretendedâ€”and was stricken by the thought that he did indeed go to fight for something more than the welfare of his own people.

And yeâ€™ll end up just as dead in the end, he thought, resigned. I dinna expect it hurts less, to ken itâ€™s for good causeâ€”but maybe so.

â€œI shall leave in a week,â€ he said quietly, and left them staring after him.



HE HAD EXPECTED his Ardsmuir men to come: the three Lindsay brothers, Hugh Abernathy, Padraic MacNeill, and the rest. Not expected, but gladly welcomed, were Robin McGillivray and his son, Manfred.

Ute McGillivray had forgiven him, he saw, with a certain sense of amusement. Besides Robin and Freddie, fifteen men from near Salem had come, all relatives of the redoubtable frau.

A great surprise, though, was Hiram Crombie, who alone of the fisher-folk had decided to join him.

â€œI have prayed on the matter,â€ Hiram informed him, managing to look more piously sour than usual, â€œand I believe yeâ€™re right about the oath. I expect yeâ€™ll have us all hangit and burned oot of our homesâ€”but Iâ€™ll come, nonetheless.â€

The restâ€”with great mutterings and agitated debateâ€”had not. He didnâ€™t blame them. Having survived the aftermath of Culloden, the perilous voyage to the colonies, and the hardship of exile, the very last thing a sensible person could wish was to take up arms against the King.

The greatest surprise, though, awaited him as his small company rode out of Cooperville and turned into the road that led south.

A company of men, some forty strong, was waiting at the crossroad. He drew near warily, and a single man spurred out of the crowd and drew up with himâ€”Richard Brown, pale-faced and grim.

â€œI hear you go to Wilmington,â€ Brown said without preamble. â€œIf so be as itâ€™s agreeable, my men and I will ride with you.â€ He coughed, and added, â€œUnder your command, to be sure.â€

Behind him, he heard a small â€œhmph!â€ from Claire, and suppressed a smile. He was quite aware of the phalanx of narrowed eyes at his back. He caught Roger Macâ€™s eye, and his son-in-law gave a small nod. War made strange bedfellows; Roger Mac knew that as well as he didâ€”and for himself, he had fought with worse than Brown, during the Rising.

â€œBe welcome, then,â€ he said, and bowed from his saddle. â€œYou and your men.â€



WE MET ANOTHER militia company near a place called Mooreâ€™s Creek, and camped with them under the longleaf pines. There had been a bad ice storm the day before, and the ground was thick with fallen branches, some as large around as my waist. It made the going more difficult, but had its advantages, so far as making campfires went.

I was throwing a hastily assembled bucket of ingredients into the kettle for stewâ€”scraps of ham, with bones, beans, rice, onions, carrots, crumbled stale biscuitâ€”and listening to the other militia commander, Robert Borthy, who was telling Jamieâ€”with considerable levityâ€”about the state of the Emigrant Highland Regiment, as our opponents were formally known.

â€œThere canâ€™t be more than five or six hundred, all told,â€ he was saying with amused derision. â€œOld MacDonald and his aides have been tryinâ€™ to scoop â€™em up from the countryside for months, and I gather the effort has been akin to scoopinâ€™ water with a sieve.â€

On one occasion, Alexander McLean, one of the generalâ€™s aides, had set up a rendezvous point, calling upon all the Highlanders and Scotchâ€“Irish in the neighborhood to assembleâ€”cannily providing a hogshead of liquor as inducement. Some five hundred men had in fact shown upâ€”but as soon as the liquor was drunk, they had melted away again, leaving McLean alone, and completely lost.

â€œThe poor man wandered about for nearly two days, lookinâ€™ for the road, before someone took pity on him and led him back to civilization.â€ Borthy, a hearty backwoods soul with a thick brown beard, grinned widely at the tale, and accepted a cup of ale with due thanks before going on.

â€œGod knows where the rest of â€™em are now. I hear tell that what troops Old MacDonald has are mostly brand-new emigrantsâ€”the Governor made â€™em swear to take up arms to defend the colony before heâ€™d grant them land. Most of them poor sods are fresh off the boat from Scotlandâ€”they donâ€™t know north from south, let alone just where they are.â€

â€œOh, I ken where they are, even if they donâ€™t.â€ Ian came into the firelight, grubby but cheerful. He had been riding dispatches back and forth among the various militia companies converging on Wilmington, and his statement caused a rush of general interest.

â€œWhere?â€ Richard Brown leaned forward into the firelight, narrow face keen and foxy.

â€œTheyâ€™re cominâ€™ down Negro Head Point Road, marching like a proper regiment,â€ Ian said, sinking onto a hastily offered log with a small groan. â€œIs there anything hot to drink, Auntie? Iâ€™m frozen and parched, both.â€

There was a nasty sort of dark liquid, called â€œcoffeeâ€ for courtesyâ€™s sake, and made from boiling burned acorns. I rather dubiously poured him a cup, but he consumed it with every evidence of enjoyment, meanwhile recounting the results of his expeditions.

â€œThey meant to circle round to the west, but Colonel Howeâ€™s men got there first, and cut them off. So then they went across, meaning to take the fordâ€”but Colonel Moore put his men to the quick-step and marched all night to forestall them.â€

â€œThey made no move to engage either Howe or Moore?â€ Jamie asked, frowning. Ian shook his head, and gulped the rest of his acorn coffee.

â€œWouldna come close. Colonel Moore says they dinna mean to engage until they reach Wilmingtonâ€”theyâ€™re expecting reinforcement there.â€

I exchanged a glance with Jamie. The expected reinforcement was presumably the British regular troops, promised by General Gage. But a rider from Brunswick we had met the day before had told us that no ships had arrived when he left the coast, four days before. If there was reinforcement awaiting them, it would have to come from the local Loyalistsâ€”and from the various rumors and reports weâ€™d heard so far, the local Loyalists were a weak reed on which to lean.

â€œWell, so. Theyâ€™re cut off on either side, aye? Straight down the road is where theyâ€™re headedâ€”they might reach the bridge late tomorrow.â€

â€œHow far is it, Ian?â€ Jamie asked, squinting through the vista of longleaf pines. The trees were very tall, and the grassland under them wide openâ€”very reasonable for riding.

â€œMaybe half a day on horseback.â€

â€œAye, then.â€ Jamie relaxed a little, and reached for his own cup of the vile brew. â€œWeâ€™ve time to sleep first, then.â€



WE REACHED the bridge at Mooreâ€™s Creek by midday the next day, and joined the company commanded by Richard Caswell, who greeted Jamie with pleasure.

The Highland regiment was nowhere in sightâ€”but dispatch riders arrived regularly, reporting their steady movement down Negro Head Point Roadâ€”a wide wagon thoroughfare that led directly to the solid plank bridge that crossed the Widow Mooreâ€™s Creek.

Jamie, Caswell, and several of the other commanders were walking up and down the bank, pointing at the bridge and up and down the shore. The creek ran through a stretch of treacherous, swampy ground, with cypress trees stretching up from water and mud. The creek itself deepened as it narrowed, thoughâ€”a plumb line that some curious soul dropped into the water off the bridge said it was fifteen feet deep at that pointâ€”and the bridge was the only feasible place for an army of any size to cross.

Which did a great deal to explain Jamieâ€™s silence over supper. He had helped to throw up a small earthwork on the far side of the creek, and his hands were smeared with dirtâ€”and grease.

â€œTheyâ€™ve cannon,â€ he said quietly, seeing me eye the smudges on his hands. He wiped them absently on his breeks, much the worse for wear. â€œTwo small guns from the townâ€”but cannon, nonetheless.â€ He looked toward the bridge, and grimaced slightly.

I knew what he was thinkingâ€”and why.

Ye were behind the cannon at Culloden, Donald, he had said to the Major. I was in front of them. With a sword in my hand. Swords were the Highlandersâ€™ natural weaponsâ€”and for most, likely their only weapons. From all we had heard, General MacDonald had managed to assemble only a small quantity of muskets and powder; most of his troops were armed with broadswords and targes. And they were marching straight into ambush.

â€œOh, Christ,â€ Jamie said, so softly I could barely hear him. â€œThe poor wee fools. The poor gallant wee fools.â€



MATTERS BECAME still worseâ€”or much better, depending on your viewpointâ€”as dusk fell. The temperature had risen since the ice storm, but the ground was sodden; moisture rose from it during the day, but then as night came on, condensed into a fog so thick that even the campfires were barely visible, each one glowing like a sullen coal in the mist.

Excitement was passing through the militia like a mosquito-borne fever, as the new conditions gave rise to new plans.

â€œNow,â€ Ian said softly, appearing like a ghost out of the fog beside Jamie. â€œCaswellâ€™s ready.â€

Such supplies as we had were already packed; carrying guns, powder, and food, eight hundred men, together with an uncounted quantity of camp-followers like myself, stole quietly through the mist toward the bridge, leaving the campfires burning behind us.

I wasnâ€™t sure exactly where MacDonaldâ€™s troops were just nowâ€”they might be still on the wagon road, or might have cautiously detoured, coming down to the edge of the swamp to reconnoiter. Good luck to them in that case, I thought. My own insides were tight with tension as I stepped carefully across the bridge; it was silly to tiptoe, but I felt a reluctance to put my feet down firmlyâ€”the fog and silence compelled a sense of secrecy and furtiveness.

I stubbed a toe against an uneven plank and lurched forward, but Roger, walking beside me, caught me by the arm and set me upright. I squeezed his arm, and he smiled a little, his face barely visible through the mist, though he was no more than a foot away.

He knew quite as well as Jamie and the rest did what was coming. Nonetheless, I sensed a strong excitement in him, mingled with dread. It was, after all, to be his first battle.

On the other side, we dispersed to make fresh camps on the hill above the circular earthwork the men had thrown up a hundred yards from the creek. I passed close enough to the guns to see their elongated snouts, poking inquisitively through the mist: Mother Covington and her daughter, the men called the two cannonâ€”I wondered idly which was which, and who the original Mother Covington might have been. A redoubtable lady, I assumedâ€”or possibly the proprietor of the local brothel.

Firewood was easy to find; the ice storm had extended to the pines near the creek, too. It was, however, bloody damp, and damned if I was going to spend an hour on my knees with a tinderbox. Luckily, no one could see what I was doing in this pea-soup fog, and I stealthily removed a small tin of Briannaâ€™s matches from my pocket.

As I was blowing on the kindling, I heard a series of odd, rending screeches from the direction of the bridge, and knelt upright, staring down the hill. I couldnâ€™t see anything, of course, but realized almost at once that it was the sound of nails giving way as planks were pried upâ€”they were dismantling the bridge.

It seemed a long time before Jamie came to find me. He refused food, but sat against a tree and beckoned to me. I sat down between his knees and leaned back against him, grateful for his warmth; the night was cold, with a damp that crept into every crevice and chilled the marrow.

â€œSurely theyâ€™ll see that the bridge is out?â€ I said, after a long silence filled with the myriad noises of the men working below.

â€œNot if the fog lasts â€™til morningâ€”and it will.â€ Jamie sounded resigned, but he seemed more peaceful than he had earlier. We sat quietly together for some time, watching the play of flames on the fogâ€”an eerie sight, as the fire seemed to shimmer and merge with the mist, the flames stretching strangely up and up, disappearing into the swirl of white.

â€œDâ€™ye believe in ghosts, Sassenach?â€ Jamie asked suddenly.

â€œEr . . . well, not to put too fine a point on it, yes,â€ I said. He knew I did, because Iâ€™d told him about my meeting with the Indian whose face was painted black. I knew he did, tooâ€”he was a Highlander. â€œWhy, have you seen one?â€

He shook his head, wrapping his arms more securely around me.

â€œNot to say â€˜seen,â€™â€ he said, sounding thoughtful. â€œBut I will be damned if heâ€™s no there.â€

â€œWho?â€ I said, rather startled at this.

â€œMurtagh,â€ he said, surprising me further. He shifted more comfortably, resettling me against him. â€œEver since the fog came in, Iâ€™ve had the most peculiar sense of him, just by me.â€

â€œReally?â€ This was fascinating, but made me thoroughly uneasy. Murtagh, Jamieâ€™s godfather, had died at Culloden, andâ€”so far as I knewâ€”hadnâ€™t been going about manifesting himself since. I didnâ€™t doubt his presence; Murtaghâ€™s had been an extremely strongâ€”if dourâ€”personality, and if Jamie said he was there, he very likely was. What made me uneasy was the contemplation of just why he might be there.

I concentrated for a time, but got no sense of the tough little Scotsman myself. Evidently, he was only interested in Jamie. That frightened me.

While the conclusion of the morrowâ€™s battle was a foregone one, a battle was a battle, and men might be killed on the winning side, as well. Murtagh had been Jamieâ€™s godfather, and took his duty to Jamie seriously. I sincerely hoped he hadnâ€™t had word that Jamie was about to be killed, and shown up to conduct him to heavenâ€”visions on the eve of battle were a fairly common occurrence in Highland lore, but Jamie did say he hadnâ€™t seen Murtagh. That was something, I supposed.

â€œHe, um, hasnâ€™t said anything to you, has he?â€

Jamie shook his head, seeming unfazed by this ghostly visitation.

â€œNay, heâ€™s just . . . there.â€ He seemed, in fact, to find this â€œtherenessâ€ a comfort, and so I didnâ€™t voice my own doubts and fears. I had them, nonetheless, and spent the rest of the short night pressed close against my husband, as though daring Murtagh or anyone else to take him from me.

THE GHOSTS OF CULLODEN




COME DAWN, ROGER STOOD BEHIND the low earthwork by his father-in-law, musket in hand, straining his eyes to peer into the mist. The sounds of an army came to him clearly; sound carried through fog. The measured tramp of feet, though they were not marching in any sort of unison. The clank of metal and rustle of cloth. Voicesâ€”the shouts of officers, he thought, beginning to rally their troops.

They would by now have found the deserted campfires; theyâ€™d know that the enemy now lay across the creek.

The smell of tallow was strong in the air; Alexander Lillingtonâ€™s men had greased the support timbers, after the planks had been removed. Heâ€™d been grasping his gun for hours, it seemed, and yet the metal was still cold in his handâ€”his fingers were stiff.

â€œDâ€™ye hear the shouting?â€ Jamie nodded toward the mist that hid the far bank. The wind had changed; no more than disconnected Gaelic phrases came from beyond the ghostly cypress trunks, and I made no sense of them. Jamie did.

â€œWhoeverâ€™s leading themâ€”I think itâ€™s McLeod, by the voiceâ€”he means to charge the creek,â€ he said.

â€œBut thatâ€™s suicide!â€ Roger blurted. â€œSurely they knowâ€”surely someoneâ€™s seen the bridge?â€

â€œThey are Highlanders,â€ Jamie said, still softly, eyes on the ramrod he pulled from its rest. â€œThey will follow the man to whom they vow loyalty, even though he leads them to their death.â€

Ian was nearby; he glanced quickly toward Roger, then over his shoulder, where Kenny and Murdo Lindsay stood with Ronnie Sinclair and the McGillivrays. They stood in a casual knot, but every hand touched a musket or rifle, and their eyes darted toward Jamie every few seconds.

They had joined Colonel Lillingtonâ€™s men on this side of the creek; Lillington was passing to and fro through the men, eyes darting back and forth, assessing readiness.

Lillington stopped abruptly at sight of Jamie, and Roger felt a nervous qualm in the pit of his stomach. Randall Lillington had been a second cousin of the Colonelâ€™s.

Alexander Lillington wasnâ€™t a man to hide his thoughts; it had quite evidently dawned on him that his own men were forty feet away and that Jamieâ€™s men stood between him and them. His eyes darted toward the mist, where Donald McLeodâ€™s bellowing was being answered by increasing roars from the Highlanders with him, then back at Jamie.

â€œWhat does he say?â€ Lillington demanded, rising on his toes and frowning toward the far bank, as though concentration might yield him meaning.

â€œHe says to them that courage will carry the day.â€ Jamie glanced toward the crest of the rise behind them. Mother Covingtonâ€™s long black snout was just visible through the mist. â€œWould that it could,â€ he added quietly in Gaelic.

Alexander Lillington reached out suddenly and grabbed Jamieâ€™s wrist.

â€œAnd you, sir?â€ he said, suspicion open in eyes and voice. â€œAre you not a Highlander, as well?â€

Lillingtonâ€™s other hand was on the pistol in his belt. Roger felt the casual talk among the men behind him stop, and glanced back. All Jamieâ€™s men were watching, with expressions of great interest but no particular alarm. Evidently, they felt Jamie could deal with Lillington by himself.

â€œI ask you, sirâ€”to whom is your loyalty?â€

â€œWhere do I stand, sir?â€ Jamie said with elaborate politeness. â€œOn this side of the creek, or on that?â€

A few men grinned at that, but forbore to laugh; the question of loyalty was a raw one still, and no man would risk it unnecessarily.

Lillingtonâ€™s grip on his wrist relaxed, but did not yet let go, though he acknowledged Jamieâ€™s statement with a nod.

â€œWell enough. But how are we to know that you do not mean to turn and fall upon us in battle? For you are a Highlander, are you not? And your men?â€

â€œI am a Highlander,â€ Jamie said bleakly. He glanced once more at the far bank, where occasional glimpses of tartan showed through the mist, and then back. The shouting echoed from the fog. â€œAnd I am the sire of Americans.â€ He pulled his wrist from Lillingtonâ€™s grasp.

â€œAnd I give ye leave, sir,â€ he continued evenly, lifting his rifle and standing it on its butt, â€œto stand behind me and thrust your sword through my heart if I fire amiss.â€

With that, he turned his back on Lillington and loaded his gun, ramming ball, powder, and patch with great precision.

A voice bellowed from the fog, and a hundred other throats took up the cry in Gaelic. â€œKING GEORGE AND BROADSWORDS!â€

The last Highland charge had begun.



THEY BURST OUT OF the mist a hundred feet from the bridge, howling, and his heart jumped in his chest. For an instantâ€”an instant onlyâ€”he felt he ran with them, and the wind of it snapped in his shirt, cold on his body.

But he stood stock-still, Murtagh beside him, looking cynically on. Roger Mac coughed, and Jamie raised the rifle to his shoulder, waiting.

â€œFire!â€ The volley struck them just before they reached the gutted bridge; half a dozen fell in the road, but the others came on. Then the cannon fired from the hill above, one and then the other, and the concussion of their discharge was like a shove against his back.

He had fired with the volley, aiming above their heads. Now swung the rifle down and pulled the ramrod. There was screaming on both sides, the shriek of wounded and the stronger bellowing of battle.

â€œA righ! A righ!â€ The King! The King!

McLeod was at the bridge; heâ€™d been hit, there was blood on his coat, but he brandished sword and targe, and ran onto the bridge, stabbing his sword into the wood to anchor himself.

The cannon spoke again, but were aimed too high; most of the Highlanders had crowded down to the banks of the creekâ€”some were in the water, clinging to the bridge supports, inching across. More were on the timbers, slipping, using their swords like McLeod to keep their balance.

â€œFire!â€ and he fired, powder smoke blending with the fog. The cannon had the range, they spoke one-two, and he felt the blast push against him, felt as though the shot had torn through him. Most of those on the bridge were in the water now, more threw themselves flat upon the timbers, trying to wriggle their way across, only to be picked off by the muskets, every man firing at will from the redoubt.

He loaded, and fired.

There he is, said a voice, dispassionate; he had no notion was it his, or Murtaghâ€™s.

McLeod was dead, his body floating in the creek for an instant before the weight of the black water pulled him down. Many men were struggling in that waterâ€”the creek was deep here, and mortal cold. Few Highlanders could swim.

He glimpsed Allan MacDonald, Floraâ€™s husband, pale and staring in the crowd on the shore.

Major Donald MacDonald floundered, rising halfway in the water. His wig was gone and his head showed bare and wounded, blood running from his scalp down over his face. His teeth were bared, clenched in agony or ferocity, there was no telling which. Another shot struck him and he fell with a splashâ€”but rose again, slow, slow, and then pitched forward into water too deep to stand, but rose yet again, splashing frantically, spraying blood from his shattered mouth in the effort to breathe.

Let it be you, then, lad, said the dispassionate voice. He raised his rifle and shot MacDonald cleanly through the throat. He fell backward and sank at once.



IT WAS OVER in minutes, the fog thick with powder smoke, the black creek choked with the dying and dead.

â€œKing George and broadswords, eh?â€ said Caswell, bleakly surveying the damage. â€œBroadswords against cannon. Poor buggers.â€

On the other side, all was confusion. Those who had not fallen at the bridge were in flight. Already, men on this side of the creek were carrying the timbers down to repair the bridge. Those who were running wouldnâ€™t get far.

He should go, too, summon his men to help in pursuit. But he stood as though turned to stone, the cold wind singing in his ears.



JACK RANDALL stood still. His sword was in his hand, but he made no effort to raise it. Only stood there, that odd smile on his lips, dark eyes burning in Jamieâ€™s own.

If he had been able to break that gaze . . . but he couldnâ€™t, and so caught the blur of movement behind Randall. Murtagh, running, bounding tussocks like a sheep. And the glint of his godfatherâ€™s bladeâ€”had he seen that, or only imagined it? No matter; heâ€™d known without doubt from the cock of Murtaghâ€™s arm, and seen before it happened the murderous strike come upward toward the Captainâ€™s red-clad back.

But Randall spun, warned maybe by some change in his eyes, the sob of Murtaghâ€™s breathâ€”or only by a soldierâ€™s instinct. Too late to avoid the thrust, but soon enough that the dirk missed its fatal aim into the kidney. Randall had grunted with the blowâ€”Christ, he could hear itâ€”and jerked aside staggering, but turning as he fell, grasping Murtaghâ€™s wrist, dragging him down in a shower of spray from the wet gorse they fell through.

They had rolled away into a hollow, locked together, struggling, and he had flung himself through the clinging plants in pursuit, some weaponâ€”what, what had he held?â€”in his fist.

But the feel of it faded against his skin; he felt the weight of the thing in his hand, but there was no shape of hilt or trigger to remind him, and it was gone again.

Leaving him with that one image: Murtagh. Murtagh, teeth clenched and bared as he struck. Murtagh, running, coming to save him.



HE BECAME SLOWLY aware again of where he was. There was a hand on his armâ€”Roger Mac, white-faced, but steady.

â€œI am going to see to them,â€ Roger Mac said, with a brief nod toward the creek. â€œYouâ€™re all right, yourself?â€

â€œAye, of course,â€ he said, though with the feeling he so often had in waking from a dreamâ€”as though he were not in fact quite real.

Roger Mac nodded and turned to walk away. Then suddenly turned back, and laying his hand once more on Jamieâ€™s arm, said very quietly, â€œEgo te absolvo.â€ Then turned again and went resolutely to tend the dying and bless the dead.

AMANDA




FROM Lâ€™Oignonâ€“Intelligencer, May 15, 1776

INDEPENDENCE!!

In the Wake of the famous Victory at Mooreâ€™s Creek Bridge, the Fourth Provincial Congress of North Carolina has voted to adopt the Halifax Resolves. These Resolutions authorize Delegates to the Continental Congress to concur with the other Delegates of the other Colonies in declaring Independency and forming foreign Alliances, reserving to this Colony the sole and exclusive Right of forming a Constitution and Laws for this Colony, and by Passage of the Halifax Resolves, North Carolina thus becomes the first Colony officially to indorse Independency.

THE FIRST SHIP of a Fleet commanded by Sir Peter Parker has arrived at the Mouth of the Cape Fear River, upon the eighteenth of April. The Fleet consists of nine Ships in total, and is bringing British Troops to pacify and unite the Colony, by the Word of Governor Josiah Martin.

STOLEN: Goods amounting to twenty-six Pounds, ten Shillings and Fourpence in Total, abstracted from the Warehouse of Mr. Neil Forbes on Water Street. Thieves broke a Hole in the Back of the Warehouse during the Night of May twelfth, and carried the Goods away by means of a Wagon. Two Men, one White, one Black, were seen driving a Wagon away with a Team of bay Mules. Any Word pertaining to this atrocious Crime will be generously Rewarded. Apply to W. Jones, in care of the Gull and Oyster on the Market Square.

BORN, to Captain Roger MacKenzie of Fraserâ€™s Ridge and his lady, a girl, on the twenty-first of April. Child and Mother are reported in good Health, the Childâ€™s name given as Amanda Claire Hope MacKenzie.

Roger had never felt so terrified as he did when his newborn daughter was placed in his arms for the first time. Minutes old, skin tender and perfect as an orchidâ€™s, she was so delicate he feared he would leave fingerprints on herâ€”but so alluring that he had to touch her, drawing the back of his knuckle gently, so gently, down the perfect curve of her fat little cheek, stroking the black cobweb silk of her hair with an unbelieving forefinger.

â€œShe looks like you.â€ Brianna, sweaty, disheveled, deflatedâ€”and so beautiful he could scarcely bear to look at herâ€”lay back against the pillows with a grin that came and went like the Cheshire Catâ€™sâ€”never entirely absent, even though it faded now and then from tiredness.

â€œDoes she?â€ He studied the tiny face with complete absorption. Not for any sign of himselfâ€”only because he couldnâ€™t take his eyes off her.

He had come to know her intimately, through the months of being roused suddenly by pokes and kicks, of watching the liquid heave of Briannaâ€™s belly, of feeling the little one swell and retreat under his hands as he lay behind his wife, cupping her stomach and making jokes.

But heâ€™d known her as Little Otto, the private name theyâ€™d used for the unborn child. Otto had had a distinct personalityâ€”and for a moment, he felt a ridiculous pang of loss, realizing that Otto was gone. This tiny, exquisite being was someone entirely new.

â€œIs she Marjorie, do you think?â€ Bree was lifting her head, peering at the blanket-wrapped bundle. Theyâ€™d discussed names for months, making lists, arguing, making fun of each otherâ€™s choices, choosing ridiculous things like Montgomery or Agatha. At last, tentatively, theyâ€™d decided that if it was a boy, the name might be Michael; if a girl, Marjorie, after Rogerâ€™s mother.

His daughter opened her eyes quite suddenly and looked at him. Her eyes were slanted; he wondered if they would stay that way, like her motherâ€™s. A sort of soft, middle blue, like the sky in mid-morningâ€”nothing remarkable, at a glance, but when you looked straight into it . . . vast, illimitable.

â€œNo,â€ he said softly, staring into those eyes. Could she see him yet? he wondered.

â€œNo,â€ he said again. â€œHer nameâ€™s Amanda.â€



I HADNâ€™T SAID anything to begin with. It was a common thing in newbornsâ€”especially babies born a bit early, as Amanda had beenâ€”nothing to worry about.

The ductus arteriosus is a small blood vessel that in the fetus joins the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Babies have lungs, of course, but prior to birth donâ€™t use them; all their oxygen comes from the placenta, via the umbilical cord. Ergo, no need for blood to be circulated to the lungs, save to nourish the developing tissueâ€”and so the ductus arteriosus bypasses the pulmonary circulation.

At birth, though, the baby takes its first breath, and oxygen sensors in this small vessel cause it to contractâ€”and close permanently. With the ductus arteriosus closed, blood heads out from the heart to the lungs, picks up oxygen, and comes back to be pumped out to the rest of the body. A neat and elegant systemâ€”save that it doesnâ€™t always work properly.

The ductus arteriosus doesnâ€™t always close. If it doesnâ€™t, blood still does go to the lungs, of courseâ€”but the bypass is still there. Too much blood goes to the lungs, in some cases, and floods them. The lungs swell, become congested, and with diverted blood flow to the body, there are problems with oxygenationâ€”which can become acute.

I moved my stethoscope over the tiny chest, ear pressed to it, listening intently. It was my best stethoscope, a model from the nineteenth century called a Pinardâ€”a bell with a flattened disc at one end, to which I pressed my ear. I had one carved of wood; this one was made of pewter; Brianna had sand-cast it for me.

In fact, though, the murmur was so distinct that I felt as though I barely needed a stethoscope. Not a click or a misplaced beat, not a too-long pause or a leaky swishâ€”there were any number of unusual sounds a heart could make, and auscultation was the first step of diagnosis. Atrial defects, ventral defects, malformed valvesâ€”all have specific murmurs, some occurring between beats, some blending with the heart sounds.

When the ductus arteriosus fails to close, itâ€™s said to be â€œpatentâ€â€”open. A patent ductus arteriosus makes a continuous shushing murmur, soft, but audible with a little concentration, particularly in the supraclavicular and cervical regions.

For the hundredth time in two days, I bent close, ear pressed to the Pinard as I moved it over Amandaâ€™s neck and chest, hoping against hope that the sound would have disappeared.

It hadnâ€™t.

â€œTurn your head, lovey, yes, thatâ€™s right. . . .â€ I breathed, delicately turning her head away from me, Pinard pressed to the side of her neck. It was hard to get the stethoscope close to her fat little neck . . . there. The murmur increased. Amanda made a little breathy noise that sounded like a giggle. I brought her head back the other wayâ€”the sound decreased.

â€œOh, bloody hell,â€ I said softly, so as not to scare her. I put down the Pinard and picked her up, cradling her against my shoulder. We were alone; Brianna had gone up to my room for a nap, and everyone else was out.

I carried her to the surgery window and looked out; it was a beautiful day in the mountain spring. The wrens were nesting under the eaves again; I could hear them above me, rustling round with sticks, conversing in small, clear chirps.

â€œBird,â€ I said, my lips close to her tiny seashell of an ear. â€œNoisy bird.â€ She squirmed lazily, and farted in reply.

â€œRight,â€ I said, smiling despite myself. I held her out a little, so I could look into her faceâ€”lovely, perfectâ€”but not as fat as it had been when she was born a week before.

It was perfectly normal for babies to lose a little weight at first, I told myself. It was.

A patent ductus arteriosus may have no symptoms, beyond that odd, continuous murmur. But it may. A bad one deprives the child of needed oxygen; the main symptoms are pulmonaryâ€”wheezing; rapid, shallow breathing; bad colorâ€”and failure to thrive, because of the energy burned up in the effort to get enough oxygen.

â€œJust let Grannie have a little listen again,â€ I said, laying her down on the quilt Iâ€™d spread over the surgery table. She gurgled and kicked as I picked up the Pinard and placed it on her chest again, moving it over neck, shoulder, arm . . .

â€œOh, Jesus,â€ I whispered, closing my eyes. â€œDonâ€™t let it be bad.â€ But the sound of the murmur seemed to grow louder, drowning my prayers.

I opened my eyes to see Brianna, standing in the doorway.



â€œI KNEW THERE was something wrong,â€ she said steadily, wiping Mandyâ€™s bottom with a damp rag before rediapering her. â€œShe doesnâ€™t nurse like Jemmy did. She acts hungry, but sheâ€™ll only nurse for a few minutes before she falls asleep. Then she wakes up and fusses again a few minutes later.â€

She sat down and offered Mandy a breast, as though in illustration of the difficulty. Sure enough, the baby latched on with every evidence of starvation. As she nursed, I picked up one of the tiny fists, unfolding her fingers. The minute nails were faintly tinged with blue.

â€œSo,â€ Brianna said calmly, â€œwhat happens now?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ This was the usual answer in most cases, truth be toldâ€”but it was always unsatisfactory, and clearly not less so now. â€œSometimes there are no symptoms, or only very minor ones,â€ I said, trying for amendment. â€œIf the opening is very large, and you have pulmonary symptomsâ€”and we haveâ€”then . . . she might be all right, only not thrivingâ€”not growing properly, because of the feeding difficulties. Orâ€â€”I took a deep breath, steeling myselfâ€”â€œshe could develop heart failure. Or pulmonary hypertensionâ€”thatâ€™s a very high blood pressure in the lungsâ€”â€

â€œI know what it is,â€ Bree said, her voice tight. â€œOr?â€

â€œOr infective endocarditis. Orâ€”not.â€

â€œWill she die?â€ she asked bluntly, looking up at me. Her jaw was set, but I saw the way she held Amanda closer, waiting for an answer. I could give her nothing but the truth.

â€œProbably.â€ The word hung in the air between us, hideous.

â€œI canâ€™t say for sure, butâ€”â€

â€œProbably,â€ Brianna echoed, and I nodded, turning away, unable to look at her face. Without such modern assistances as an echocardiogram, I of course couldnâ€™t judge the extent of the problem. But I had not only the evidence of my eyes and ears, but what I had felt passing from her skin to mineâ€”that sense of not-rightness, that eerie conviction that comes now and then.

â€œCan you fix it?â€ I heard the tremor in Briannaâ€™s voice, and went at once to put my arms around her. Her head was bent over Amanda, and I saw the tears fall, one, then another, darkening the wispy curls on top of the babyâ€™s head.

â€œNo,â€ I whispered, holding them both. Despair washed over me, but I tightened my hold, as though I could keep time and blood both at bay. â€œNo, I canâ€™t.â€



â€œWELL, THEREâ€™S NO choice, is there?â€ Roger felt preternaturally calm, recognizing it as the artificial calm produced by shock but wishing to cling to it as long as possible. â€œYouâ€™ve got to go.â€

Brianna leveled a look at him, but didnâ€™t reply. Her hand roamed over the baby, sleeping in her lap, smoothing the woolly blanket over and over again.

Claire had explained it all to him, more than once, patiently, seeing that he could not take it in. He still did not believe itâ€”but the sight of those tiny fingernails, turning blue as Amanda strove to suck, had sunk into him like an owlâ€™s talons.

It was, she had said, a simple operationâ€”in a modern operating room.

â€œYou canâ€™t . . . ?â€ heâ€™d asked, with a vague motion toward her surgery. â€œWith the ether?â€

Sheâ€™d closed her eyes and shaken her head, looking nearly as ill as he felt.

â€œNo. I can do very simple thingsâ€”hernias, appendixes, tonsilsâ€”and even those are a risk. But something so invasive, on such a tiny body . . . no,â€ she repeated, and he saw resignation in her face when she met his eyes. â€œNo. If sheâ€™s to liveâ€”you have to take her back.â€

And so they had begun to discuss the unthinkable. Because there were choicesâ€”and decisions to be made. But the unalterable basic fact was clear. Amanda must go through the stonesâ€”if she could.



JAMIE FRASER took his fatherâ€™s ruby ring, and held it over the face of his granddaughter. Amandaâ€™s eyes fixed on it at once, and she stuck out her tongue with interest. He smiled, despite the heaviness of his heart, and lowered the ring for her to grab at.

â€œShe likes that well enough,â€ he said, skillfully removing it from her grip before she could get it into her mouth. â€œLetâ€™s try the other.â€

The other was Claireâ€™s amuletâ€”the tiny, battered leather pouch given to her by an Indian wisewoman years before. It contained assorted bits and bobs, herbs, he thought, and feathers, perhaps the tiny bones of a bat. But in among them was a lump of stoneâ€”nothing much to look at, but a true gemstone, a raw sapphire.

Amanda turned her head at once, more interested in the pouch than she had been in the shiny ring. She made cooing noises and batted wildly with both hands, trying to reach it.

Brianna took a deep, half-strangled breath.

â€œMaybe,â€ she said, in the voice of one who fears as much as hopes. â€œBut we canâ€™t tell for sure. What if Iâ€”take her, and I go through, but she canâ€™t?â€

They all looked at one another in silence, envisioning the possibility.

â€œYouâ€™d come back,â€ Roger said gruffly, and put a hand on Breeâ€™s shoulder. â€œYouâ€™d come right back.â€

The tension in her body eased a little at his touch. â€œIâ€™d try,â€ she said, and attempted a smile.

Jamie cleared his throat.

â€œIs wee Jem about?â€

Of course he was; he never went far from home or Brianna these days, seeming to sense that something was wrong. He was retrieved from Jamieâ€™s study, where he had been spelling out words inâ€”

â€œJesus Christ on a piece of toast!â€ his grandmother blurted, snatching the book from him. â€œJamie! How could you?â€

Jamie felt a deep blush rise over him. How could he, indeed? Heâ€™d taken the battered copy of Fanny Hill in trade, part of a parcel of used books bought from a tinker. He hadnâ€™t looked at the books before buying them, and when he did come to look them over . . . Well, it was quite against his instincts to throw away a bookâ€”any book.

â€œWhatâ€™s P-H-A-L-L-U-S?â€ Jemmy was asking his father.

â€œAnother word for prick,â€ Roger said briefly. â€œDonâ€™t bloody use it. Listenâ€”can ye hear anything, when ye listen to that stone?â€ He indicated Jamieâ€™s ring lying on the table. Jemâ€™s face lighted at sight of it.

â€œSure,â€ he said.

â€œWhat, from there?â€ Brianna said, incredulous. Jem looked around the circle of parents and grandparents, surprised at their interest. â€œSure,â€ he repeated. â€œIt sings.â€

â€œDo ye think wee Mandy can hear it sing, too?â€ Jamie asked carefully. His heart was beating heavily, afraid to know, either way.

Jemmy picked up the ring and leaned over Mandyâ€™s basket, holding it directly over her face. She kicked energetically and made noisesâ€”but whether because of the ring, or merely at the sight of her brother . . .

â€œShe can hear it,â€ Jem said, smiling into his sisterâ€™s face.

â€œHow do you know?â€ Claire asked, curious. Jem looked up at her, surprised.

â€œShe says so.â€



NOTHING WAS SETTLED. At the same time, everything was settled. I was in no doubt as to what my ears and my fingers told meâ€”Amandaâ€™s condition was slowly worsening. Very slowlyâ€”it might take a year, two years, before serious damage began to showâ€”but it was coming.

Jem might be right; he might not be. But we had to proceed on the assumption that he was.

There were arguments, discussionsâ€”tears. Not yet any decision as to who should attempt the journey through the stones. Brianna and Amanda must go; that was certain. But ought Roger to go with them? Or Jemmy?

â€œI will not let you go without me,â€ Roger said through his teeth.

â€œI donâ€™t want to go without you!â€ Bree cried, looking exasperated. â€œBut how can we leave Jemmy here, without us? And how can we make him go? A babyâ€”we think that can work, because of the legends, but Jemâ€”how will he make it? We canâ€™t let him risk being killed!â€

I looked at the stones on the tableâ€”Jamieâ€™s ring, my pouch with the sapphire.

â€œI think,â€ I said carefully, â€œthat we need to find two more stones. Just in case.â€

And so, in late June, we came down from the mountain, into turmoil.

July 4, 1776

IT WAS CLOSE AND HOT IN THE INN ROOM, but I couldnâ€™t go out; little Amanda had finally fussed herself to sleepâ€”she had a rash on her bottom, poor thingâ€”and was curled in her basket, tiny thumb in her mouth and a frown on her face.

I unfolded the gauze mosquito netting and draped it carefully over the basket, then opened the window. The air outside was hot, too, but fresh, and moving. I pulled off my capâ€”without it, Mandy was fond of clutching my hair in both her hands and yanking; she had an amazing amount of strength, for a child with a heart defect. For the millionth time, I wondered whether I could have been wrong.

But I wasnâ€™t. She was asleep now, with the delicate rose bloom of a healthy baby on her cheeks; awake and kicking, that soft flush faded, and an equally beautiful but unearthly blue tinge showed now and then in her lips, in the beds of her tiny nails. She was still livelyâ€”but tiny. Bree and Roger were both large people; Jemmy had put on weight like a small hippopotamus through his first several years of life. Mandy weighed scarcely more than she had at birth.

No, I wasnâ€™t wrong. I moved her basket to the table, where the warm breeze could play over her, and sat down beside it, laying my fingers gently on her chest.

I could feel it. Just as I had in the beginning, but stronger now that I knew what it was. If I had had a proper operating suite, the blood transfusions, the calibrated and carefully administered anesthesia, the oxygen mask, the swift, trained nurses . . . No surgery on the heart is a minor thing, and surgery on an infant is always a great riskâ€”but I could have done it. Could feel in the tips of my fingers exactly what needed to be done, could see in the back of my eyes the heart, smaller than my fist, the slippery, pumping, rubbery muscle and the blood washing through the ductus arteriosus, a small vessel, no bigger than an eighth of an inch in circumference. A small nick in the axillary vessel, a quick ligation of the ductus itself with a number-8 silk ligature. Done.

I knew. But knowledge is not, alas, always power. Nor is desire. It wouldnâ€™t be me who would save this precious granddaughter.

Would anyone? I wondered, giving way momentarily to the dark thoughts I fought to keep at bay when anyone else was near. Jemmy might not be right. Any baby might grab at a brightly colored shiny thing like a ruby ringâ€”but then I remembered her cooing, batting at my decrepit leather amulet pouch with the raw sapphire inside.

Perhaps. I didnâ€™t want to think about the dangers of the passageâ€”or the certainty of permanent separation, no matter whether the journey through the stones was successful or not.

There were noises outside; I looked toward the harbor, and saw the masts of a large ship, far out to sea. Another, still farther out. My heart skipped a beat.

They were oceangoing ships, not the little packet boats and fishing smacks that sailed up and down the coast. Could they be part of the fleet, sent in answer to Governor Martinâ€™s plea for help to suppress, subdue, and reclaim the colony? The first ship of that fleet had arrived at Cape Fear in late Aprilâ€”but the troops it carried had been lying low, waiting for the rest.

I watched for some time, but the ships didnâ€™t come in closer. Perhaps they were hanging off, waiting for the rest of the fleet? Perhaps they werenâ€™t British ships at all, but Americans, escaping the British blockade of New England by sailing south.

I was distracted from my thoughts by the clumping of male feet on the stairs, accompanied by snorts and that peculiarly Scottish sort of giggling usually depicted in printâ€”but by no means adequatelyâ€”as â€œHeuch, heuch, heuch!â€

It was clearly Jamie and Ian, though I couldnâ€™t understand what was giving rise to so much hilarity, since when last seen they had been bound for the docks, charged with dispatching a shipment of tobacco leaves, obtaining pepper, salt, sugar, cinnamonâ€”if findableâ€”and pinsâ€”somewhat rarer than cinnamonâ€”for Mrs. Bug, and procuring a large fish of some edible sort for our supper.

Theyâ€™d got the fish, at least: a large king mackerel. Jamie was carrying it by the tail, whatever it had been wrapped in having evidently been lost in some accident. His queue had come undone, so that long red strands frayed out over the shoulder of his coat, which in turn had a sleeve half wrenched off, a fold of white shirt protruding through the torn seam. He was covered with dust, as was the fish, and while the latterâ€™s eyes both bulged accusingly, one of his own was swollen nearly shut.

â€œOh, God,â€ I said, burying my face in one hand. I looked up at him through splayed fingers. â€œDonâ€™t tell me. Neil Forbes?â€

â€œAch, no,â€ he said, dropping the fish with a splat on the table in front of me. â€œA wee difference of opinion wiâ€™ the Wilmington Chowder and Marching Society.â€

â€œA difference of opinion,â€ I repeated.

â€œAye, they thought theyâ€™d throw us in the harbor, and we thought they wouldnâ€™t.â€ He slung a chair round with his boot and sat down on it backward, arms crossed on its back. He looked indecently cheerful, face flushed with sun and laughter.

â€œI donâ€™t want to know,â€ I said, though of course I did. I glanced at Ian, who was still sniggering quietly to himself, and observed that while he was slightly less battered than Jamie, he had one forefinger lodged in his nose up to the knuckle.

â€œHave you got a bloody nose, Ian?â€

He shook his head, still giggling. â€œNo, Auntie. Some oâ€™ the Society do, though.â€

â€œWell, why have you got your finger up your nose, then? Have you picked up a tick or something?â€

â€œNo, heâ€™s keepinâ€™ his brains from falling out,â€ Jamie said, and went off into another fit. I glanced at the basket, but Mandy slept peacefully on, quite used to racket.

â€œWell, maybe youâ€™d best stick both your own fingers up your nose, then,â€ I suggested. â€œKeep you out of trouble for a moment or two, at least.â€ I tilted up Jamieâ€™s chin to get a better look at the eye. â€œYou hit someone with that fish, didnâ€™t you?â€

The giggling had died down to a subterranean vibration between them, but threatened at this to break out anew.

â€œGilbert Butler,â€ Jamie said with a masterful effort at self-control. â€œSmack across the face. Sent him straight across the quay and into the water.â€

Ianâ€™s shoulders shook with remembered ecstasy.

â€œBride, what a splash! Oh, it was a braw fight, Auntie! I thought Iâ€™d broke my hand on a fellowâ€™s jaw, but itâ€™s all right now the deadness has worn off. Just a bit numb and tingly.â€ He wiggled the free fingers of his hand at me in illustration, wincing only slightly as he did so.

â€œDo take your finger out of your nose, Ian,â€ I said, anxiety over their condition fading into annoyance at how theyâ€™d got that way. â€œYou look like a half-wit.â€

For some reason, they both found that hysterically funny and laughed like loons. Ian did, however, eventually withdraw the finger, with an expression of wary cautiousness, as though he truly expected his brains to follow in its wake. Nothing did emerge, though, not even the ordinary bits of unsavory excreta one might expect from such a maneuver.

Ian looked puzzled, then mildly alarmed. He sniffed, prodding experimentally at his nose, then stuck the finger back into his nostril, rooting vigorously.

Jamie went on grinning, but his amusement began to fade as Ianâ€™s explorations became more frantic.

â€œWhat? Yeâ€™ve not lost it, have ye, lad?â€

Ian shook his head, frowning.

â€œNay, I feel it. Itâ€™s . . .â€ He stopped, giving Jamie a panic-stricken look over the embedded finger. â€œItâ€™s stuck, Uncle Jamie! I canna get it out!â€

Jamie was on his feet at once. He pulled the finger from its resting-place with a moist, sucking noise, then tilted back Ianâ€™s head, peering urgently up his nose with his one good eye.

â€œBring a light, Sassenach, will ye?â€

There was a candlestick on the table, but I knew from experience that the only likely effect of using a candle to look up someoneâ€™s nose was to set their nose hairs on fire. Instead, I bent and pulled my medical kit out from under the settle where I had stowed it.

â€œIâ€™ll get it,â€ I said, with the confidence of one who has removed everything from cherry pits to live insects from the nasal cavities of small children. I drew out my longest pair of thin forceps, and clicked the slender blades together in token of assurance. â€œWhatever it is. Just keep quite still, Ian.â€

The whites of Ianâ€™s eyes showed briefly in alarm as he looked at the shining metal of the forceps, and he looked pleadingly at Jamie.

â€œWait. Iâ€™ve a better idea.â€ Jamie laid a quelling hand on my arm for an instant, then disappeared out the door. He thundered downstairs, and I heard a sudden burst of laughter from below, as the door to the taproom opened. The sound was as suddenly cut off as the door closed, like the valve on a faucet.

â€œAre you all right, Ian?â€ There was a smear of red on his upper lip; his nose was beginning to bleed, aggravated by his jabbings and pokings.

â€œWell, I do hope so, Auntie.â€ His original jubilation was beginning to be replaced by a certain expression of worry. â€œYe dinna think I can have pushed it into my brain, do ye?â€

â€œI think it very unlikely. What on earthâ€”â€

But the door below had opened and closed again, spilling another brief spurt of talk and laughter into the stairwell. Jamie took the stairs two at a time and popped back into the room, smelling of hot bread and ale, and holding a small, battered snuffbox in his hand.

Ian seized on this with gratitude and, sprinkling a quick pinch of black, dusty grains on the back of his hand, hastily inhaled it.

For an instant, all three of us held breathlessâ€”and then it came, a sneeze of gargantuan proportions that rocked Ianâ€™s body back on its stool, even as his head flew forwardâ€”and a small, hard object struck the table with a ping! and bounced off into the hearth.

Ian went on sneezing, in a fusillade of hapless snorts and explosions, but Jamie and I were both on our knees, scrabbling in the ashes, heedless of filth.

â€œIâ€™ve got it! I think,â€ I added, sitting back on my heels and peering at the handful of ashes I held, in the midst of which was a small, round, dust-covered object.

â€œAye, thatâ€™s it.â€ Jamie seized my neglected forceps from the table, plucked the object delicately from my hand, and dropped it into my glass of water. A delicate plume of ash and soot floated up through the water to form a dusty gray film on the surface. Below, the object glittered up at us, serene and glowing, its beauty at last revealed. A faceted clear stone, the color of golden sherry, half the size of my thumbnail.

â€œChrysoberyl,â€ Jamie said softly, a hand on my back. He looked at Mandyâ€™s basket, the silky black curls lifting gently in the breeze. â€œDâ€™ye think it will serve?â€

Ian, still wheezing and watery-eyed, and with a red-stained handkerchief pressed to his much-abused proboscis, came to look over my other shoulder.

â€œHalf-wit, is it?â€ he said in tones of deep satisfaction. â€œHa!â€

â€œWherever did you get that? Or rather,â€ I corrected myself, â€œwho did you steal it from?â€

â€œNeil Forbes.â€ Jamie picked the gem up, turning it gently over in his fingers. â€œThere were a good deal more oâ€™ the Chowder Society than there were of us, so we ran down the street and round the corner, down between the warehouses there.â€

â€œI kent Forbesâ€™s place, aye, because Iâ€™d been there before,â€ Ian put in. One of Mandyâ€™s feet was sticking up out of the basket; he touched the sole of it with a fingertip, and smiled to see her toes extend in reflex. â€œThere was a great hole in the back where someone had broken down the wall, just covered over with a sheet of canvas, nailed over it, like. So we pulled it loose and ducked inside.â€

Where they had found themselves standing next to the small enclosed space Forbes used for an officeâ€”and for the moment, deserted.

â€œIt was sitting in a bittie wee box on the desk,â€ Ian said, coming to look proprietorially at the chrysoberyl. â€œJust sitting there! Iâ€™d just picked it up to look at, when we hear the watchman coming. Soâ€”â€ He shrugged and smiled at me, happiness momentarily transforming his homely features.

â€œAnd you think the watchman wonâ€™t tell him you were there?â€ I asked skeptically. The two of them could scarcely be more conspicuous.

â€œOh, I imagine he will.â€ Jamie bent over Mandyâ€™s basket, holding the chrysoberyl between thumb and forefinger. â€œLook what Grandda and Uncle Ian have brought ye, a muirninn,â€ he said softly.

â€œWe decided that it was a small enough ransom to pay for what he did to Brianna,â€ Ian said, sobering somewhat. â€œI expect Mr. Forbes may feel it reasonable, too. And if notâ€”â€ He smiled again, though not with happiness, and put his hand to his knife. â€œHeâ€™s got another ear, after all.â€

Very slowly, a tiny fist rose through the netting, fingers flexing as they grasped at the stone.

â€œIs she still asleep?â€ I whispered. Jamie nodded, and gently withdrew the stone.

On the far side of the table, the fish stared austerely at the ceiling, ignoring everything.

THE NINTH EARL

OF ELLESMERE




July 9, 1776

THE WATER WONâ€™T BE COLD.â€

Sheâ€™d spoken automatically, without thinking.

â€œI shouldnâ€™t think that will matter much.â€ A nerve jumped in Rogerâ€™s cheek, and he turned away abruptly. She reached out, touching him delicately, as though he were a bomb that might explode if jarred. He glanced at her, hesitated, then took the hand she offered him, with a small, crooked smile.

â€œSorry,â€ he said.

â€œIâ€™m sorry, too,â€ she said softly. They stood close together, fingers knotted, watching the tide recede across the narrow beach, a fraction of an inch uncovered with each lap of the tiny waves.

The flats were gray and bleak in the evening light, pebble-strewn and rust-stained from the peaty waters of the river. With the tide going out, the harbor water was brown and feculent, the stain reaching past the ships at anchor, nearly to the open sea. When it turned, the clear gray water of the ocean would flow in, sweeping up the Cape Fear, obliterating the mudflats and everything on them.

â€œOver there,â€ she said, still softly, though there was no one near enough to hear them. She tilted her head, indicating a group of weathered mooring posts driven deep into the mud. A skiff was tied to one; two of the pirettas, the four-oared â€œdragonfliesâ€ that plied the harbor, to another.

â€œYouâ€™re sure?â€ He shifted his weight, glancing up and down the shore.

The narrow beach fell away into cold pebbles, exposed and gleaming with the leaving of the tide. Small crabs skittered hastily among them, not to waste a momentâ€™s gleaning.

â€œIâ€™m sure. People in the Blue Boar were talking about it. A traveler asked where, and Mrs. Smoots said it was the old mooring posts, near the warehouses.â€ A torn flounder lay dead among the rocks, white flesh washed clean and bloodless. The small busy claws picked and shredded, tiny maws gaped and gulped, pinching at morsels. She felt her gorge rise at the sight, and swallowed hard. It wouldnâ€™t matter what came after; she knew that. But still . . .

Roger nodded absently. His eyes narrowed against the harbor wind, calculating distances.

â€œThereâ€™ll be quite a crowd, I expect.â€

There already was one; the turn of the tide wouldnâ€™t be for an hour or more, but people were drifting down to the harbor in twos and threes and fours, standing in the lee of the chandlery to smoke their pipes, sitting on the barrels of salt fish to talk and gesture. Mrs. Smoots had been right; several were pointing out the mooring posts to their less knowledgeable companions.

Roger shook his head.

â€œItâ€™ll have to be from that side; the best view is from there.â€ He nodded across the inner arc of the harbor toward the three ships that rocked at the main quay. â€œFrom one of the ships? What do you think?â€

Brianna fumbled in the pocket tied at her waist, and pulled out her small brass telescope. She frowned in concentration, lips pursed as she surveyed the shipsâ€”a fishing ketch, Mr. Chesterâ€™s brig, and a larger ship, part of the British fleet, that had come in in the early afternoon.

â€œWhoa, Nellie,â€ she murmured, arresting the sweep of her gaze as the pale blotch of a head filled the lens. â€œIs that who I think . . . hot dog, it is!â€ A tiny flame of delight flared in her bosom, warming her.

â€œIs who?â€ Roger squinted, straining to see unaided.

â€œItâ€™s John! Lord John!â€

â€œLord John Grey? Youâ€™re sure?â€

â€œYes! On the brigâ€”he must have come down from Virginia. Woops, heâ€™s gone nowâ€”but heâ€™s there, I saw him!â€ She turned to Roger, excited, folding her telescope as she gripped him by the arm.

â€œCome on! Letâ€™s go and find him. Heâ€™ll help.â€

Roger followed, though with considerably less enthusiasm.

â€œYouâ€™re going to tell him? Do you think thatâ€™s wise?â€

â€œNo, but it doesnâ€™t matter. He knows me.â€

Roger looked sharply at her, but the dark look on his face thawed into a reluctant smile.

â€œYou mean he knows better than to try stopping you doing whatever youâ€™ve made up your bloody-minded mind to do?â€

She smiled back at him, thanking him with her eyes. He didnâ€™t like itâ€”in fact, he hated it, and she didnâ€™t blame himâ€”but he wouldnâ€™t try to stop her, either. He knew her, too.

â€œYes. Come on, before he disappears!â€

It was a slow slog round the curve of the harbor, pushing through the knots of gathering sightseers. Outside The Breakers, the crowd grew abruptly thicker. A cluster of red-coated soldiers stood and sat in disarray on the pavement, seabags and chests scattered round them, their number too great to fit inside the tavern. Ale pots and pints of cider were being passed from hand to hand from the interior of the public house, slopping freely on the heads of those over whom they passed.

A sergeant, harrassed but competent, was leaning against the timbered wall of the inn, riffling through a sheaf of papers, issuing orders and eating a meat pie, simultaneously. Brianna wrinkled her nose as they stepped carefully through the obstacle course of scattered men and luggage; a reek of seasickness and unclean flesh rose from the serried ranks.

A few onlookers muttered under their breath at sight of the soldiers; several more cheered and waved as they passed, to receive genial shouts in return. Newly liberated from the bowels of the Scorpion, the soldiers were too thrilled with their freedom and the taste of fresh food and drink to care who did or said anything whatever.

Roger stepped in front of her, thrusting a way through the crowd with shoulders and elbows. Appreciative shouts and whistles rose from the soldiers as they saw her, but she kept her head down, eyes fixed on Rogerâ€™s feet as he shoved ahead.

She heaved a sigh of relief as they emerged from the press at the head of the quay. The soldiersâ€™ equipment was being unloaded from the Scorpion at the far side of the dock, but there was little foot traffic near the brig. She paused, looking to and fro for a glimpse of Lord Johnâ€™s distinctive fair head.

â€œThere he is!â€ Roger tugged at her arm, and she swung in the direction he was pointing, only to collide heavily with him as he stepped abruptly back.

â€œWhatâ€”â€ she began crossly, but then stopped, feeling as though she had been punched in the chest.

â€œWho in Godâ€™s holy name is that?â€ Roger spoke softly, echoing her thoughts.

Lord John Grey stood near the far end of the quay, in animated conversation with one of the red-coated soldiers. An officer; gold braid gleamed on his shoulder and he carried a laced tricorne beneath one arm. It wasnâ€™t the manâ€™s uniform that caught her attention, though.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,â€ she whispered, feeling numb around the lips.

He was tallâ€”very tallâ€”with a breadth of shoulder and a stretch of white-stockinged calf that were attracting admiring glances from a cluster of oyster girls. It was something more than height or build that made gooseflesh ripple down the length of her spine, though; it was the fact of his carriage, his outline, a cock of the head and an air of physical self-confidence that drew eyes like a magnet.

â€œItâ€™s Da,â€ she said, knowing even as she spoke that this was ridiculous. Even had Jamie Fraser for some unimaginable reason chosen to disguise himself in a soldierâ€™s uniform and come down to the docks, this man was different. As he turned to look at something across the harbor, she saw that he was differentâ€”lean, like her father, and muscular, but still with the slenderness of boyishness. Gracefulâ€”like Jamieâ€”but with the slight hesitancy of teenaged awkwardness not long past.

He turned further, backlit by the glow of light off the water, and she felt her knees go weak. A long, straight nose, rising to a high forehead . . . the sudden curve of a broad Viking cheekbone . . . Roger gripped her tightly by the arm, but his attention was as riveted on the young man as hers was.

â€œI . . . will . . . be . . . damned,â€ he said.

She gulped air, trying to get enough breath.

â€œYou and me both. And him.â€

â€œHim?â€

â€œHim, him, and him!â€ Lord John, the mysterious young soldierâ€”and most of all, her father. â€œCome on.â€ She pulled free and strode down the quay, feeling oddly disembodied, as though she watched herself from a distance.

It was like watching herself come toward a fun-house mirror, seeing herselfâ€”her face, her height, her gesturesâ€”suddenly transposed inside a red coat and doeskin breeches. His hair was dark, chestnut-brown, not red, but it was thick like hers, with the same slight wave to it, the same cowlick that lifted it off his brow.

Lord John turned his head slightly, and caught sight of her. His eyes bulged and a look of absolute horror blanched his features. He made a feeble flapping motion with one hand, trying to stop her coming nearer, but he might as well have tried to stop the Cornish Express.

â€œHello there!â€ she said brightly. â€œFancy meeting you here, Lord John!â€

Lord John made a faint quacking noise, like a stepped-on duck, but she wasnâ€™t paying attention. The young man turned to face her, smiling cordially.

Holy God, he had her fatherâ€™s eyes, too. Dark-lashed, and so young the skin near them was fresh and clear, completely unlinedâ€”but the same slanted blue Fraser cat eyes. Just like hers.

Her heart was hammering so hard in her chest she was sure they could hear it. The young man seemed to find nothing amiss, though; he bowed to her, smiling, but very correct.

â€œYour servant, maâ€™am,â€ he said. He glanced at Lord John, plainly expecting an introduction.

Lord John pulled himself together with an obvious effort, and made her a leg.

â€œMy dear. How . . . delightful to encounter you again. I had no idea. . . .â€

Yeah, I bet you didnâ€™t, she thought, but went on smiling pleasantly. She could feel Roger beside her, nodding and saying something in response to his Lordshipâ€™s greeting, trying his best not to stare.

â€œMy son,â€ Lord John was saying. â€œWilliam, Lord Ellesmere.â€ He eyed her narrowly, as though daring her to say anything. â€œMight I present Mr. Roger MacKenzie, William? And his wife.â€

â€œSir. Mrs. MacKenzie.â€ The young man took her hand before she realized what he meant to do, and bowed low over it, planting a small formal kiss upon her knuckles.

She nearly gasped at the unexpected touch of his breath on her skin, but instead gripped his hand, much harder than sheâ€™d meant to. He looked momentarily disconcerted, but extricated himself with reasonable grace. He was much younger than sheâ€™d thought at first glance; it was the uniform and the air of self-possession that made him seem older. He was looking at her with a slight frown on his clear-cut features, as though trying to place her.

â€œI think . . .â€ he began, hesitant. â€œHave we met, Mrs. MacKenzie?â€

â€œNo,â€ she said, astonished to hear her voice emerge sounding normal. â€œNo, Iâ€™m afraid not. I would have remembered.â€ She darted a daggerlike glance at Lord John, who had gone slightly green around the gills.

Lord John had been a soldier, too, though. He pulled himself together with a visible effort, putting a hand on Williamâ€™s arm.

â€œYouâ€™d best go and see to your men, William,â€ he said. â€œShall we dine together later?â€

â€œI am engaged to the Colonel for supper, Father,â€ William said. â€œBut I am sure he would not object, was you to join us. It may be quite late, though,â€ he added. â€œI understand there is to be an execution in the morning, and my troops are asked to be at the ready, in case of disturbance in the town. It will take some time to settle and organize everything.â€

â€œDisturbance.â€ Lord John was eyeing her over Williamâ€™s shoulder. â€œIs a disturbance expected, then?â€

William shrugged.

â€œI cannot say, Papa. Apparently it is not a political matter, though, but only a pirate. I shouldnâ€™t think there would be any trouble.â€

â€œThese days everything is a political matter, Willie,â€ his father said, rather sharply. â€œNever forget that. And itâ€™s always wiser to expect trouble than to meet it unprepared.â€

The young man flushed slightly, but kept his countenance.

â€œQuite,â€ he said in clipped tones. â€œI am sure you have a familiarity with the local conditions which I lack. I am obliged to you for your advice, Father.â€ He relaxed slightly, and turned to bow to Brianna.

â€œPleased to have your acquaintance, Mrs. MacKenzie. Your servant, sir.â€ He nodded to Roger, turned, and strode off down the quay, adjusting his tricorne to the proper angle of authority.

Brianna inhaled deeply, hoping that by the time she let her breath out, she would have words to go with it. Lord John beat her to it.

â€œYes,â€ he said simply. â€œOf course he is.â€

Amid the logjam of thoughts, reactions, and emotions that clogged her brain, she seized on the one that seemed momentarily most important.

â€œDoes my mother know?â€

â€œDoes Jamie know?â€ Roger asked at the same instant. She looked at him in surprise, and he raised one eyebrow at her. Yes, a man could certainly father a child without realizing it. He had.

Lord John sighed. With Williamâ€™s departure, he had relaxed somewhat, and the natural color was coming back to his face. He had been a soldier long enough to recognize the inevitable when he saw it.

â€œThey both know, yes.â€

â€œHow old is he?â€ Roger asked abruptly. Lord John shot him a sharp glance.

â€œEighteen. And to save your counting backward, it was 1758. In a place called Helwater, in the Lake District.â€

Brianna took another breath, finding this one came a little easier.

â€œOkay. So itâ€”heâ€”it was before my mother . . . came back.â€

â€œYes. From France, supposedly. Where, I gather, you were born and raised.â€ He gave her a gimlet look; he knew she spoke no more than bastard French.

She could feel the blood rushing to her face.

â€œThis is no time for secrets,â€ she said. â€œIf you want to know about my mother and me, Iâ€™ll tell youâ€”but youâ€™re going to tell me about him.â€ She jerked her head angrily backward, toward the tavern. â€œAbout my brother!â€

Lord John pursed his lips, regarding her through narrowed eyes as he thought. Finally he nodded.

â€œI see no help for it. One thing, thoughâ€”are your parents here, in Wilmington?â€

â€œYes. In fact . . .â€ She looked upward, trying to make out the position of the sun through the thin coastal haze. It hung just above the horizon, a disc of burning gold. â€œWe were going to meet them for supper.â€

â€œHere?â€

â€œYes.â€

Lord John swung round to Roger.

â€œMr. MacKenzie. You will very much oblige me, sir, if you will go at once to find your father-in-law, and apprise him of the presence of the ninth Earl of Ellesmere. Tell him that I trust his good judgment will dictate an immediate removal from Wilmington upon receipt of this news.â€

Roger stared at him for a moment, brows quirked in interest.

â€œThe Earl of Ellesmere? How the hell did he manage that?â€

Lord John had recovered all his natural color, and a bit more. He was distinctly pink in the face.

â€œNever mind! Will you go? Jamie must leave the town, at once, before they meet by inadvertenceâ€”or before someone sees the two of them separately and begins to speculate aloud.â€

â€œI doubt Jamie will leave,â€ Roger said, looking at Lord John with a certain degree of speculation himself. â€œNot before tomorrow, in any case.â€

â€œWhy not?â€ Lord John demanded, looking from one to the other. â€œWhy are you all here in the first place? It isnâ€™t the exeâ€”oh, good Lord, donâ€™t tell me.â€ He clapped a hand to his face, and dragged it slowly down, glaring through his fingers with the expression of a man tried beyond bearing.

Brianna bit her lower lip. When she spotted Lord John, she had been not only pleased but relieved of a small bit of her burden of worry, counting on him to help in her plan. With this new complication, though, she felt torn in two, unable to cope with either situation, or even to think about them coherently. She looked over at Roger, seeking advice.

He met her eyes in one of those long, unspoken marital exchanges. Then he nodded, making the decision for her.

â€œIâ€™ll go find Jamie. You have a bit of a chat with his Lordship, eh?â€

He bent and kissed her, hard, then turned and strode away down the dock, walking in a way that made people draw unconsciously aside, avoiding the touch of his garments.

Lord John had closed his eyes, and appeared to be prayingâ€”presumably for strength. She gripped him by the arm and his eyes sprang open, startled as though he had been bitten by a horse.

â€œIs it as striking as I think?â€ she said. â€œHim and me?â€ The word felt funny on her tongue. Him.

Lord John looked at her, fair brow furrowed in troubled concentration as he searched her face, feature by feature.

â€œI think so,â€ he said slowly. â€œTo me, certainly. To a casual observer, perhaps much less so. There is the difference of coloring, to be sure, and of sex; his uniform . . . but, my dear, you know that your own appearance is so strikingâ€”â€ So freakish, he meant. She sighed, taking his meaning.

â€œPeople stare at me anyway,â€ she finished for him. She pulled down the brim of her hat, drawing it far enough forward to hide not only hair but face, as well, and glowered at him from its shadow. â€œThen weâ€™d better go where no one who knows him will see me, hadnâ€™t we?â€



THE QUAY AND THE market streets were thronged. Every public house in townâ€”and not a few private onesâ€”would soon be full of quartered soldiers. Her father and Jem were with Alexander Lillington, her mother and Mandy at Dr. Fentimanâ€™s, both places centers of business and gossip, and she had declared that she possessed no intention of going near either parent in any caseâ€”not until she knew all there was to know. Lord John thought that might be rather more than he was himself prepared to tell her, but this was not a time for quibbles.

Still, the exigencies of privacy left them a choice of graveyard or the deserted racetrack, and Brianna saidâ€”a marked edge in her voiceâ€”that under the circumstances, she wanted no heavy-handed reminders of mortality.

â€œThese mortal circumstances,â€ he said carefully, leading her around a large puddle. â€œYou refer to tomorrowâ€™s execution? It is Stephen Bonnet, I collect?â€

â€œYes,â€ she said, distracted. â€œThat can wait, though. You arenâ€™t engaged for supper, are you?â€

â€œNo. Butâ€”â€

â€œWilliam,â€ she said, eyes on her shoes as they paced slowly round the sandy oval. â€œWilliam, ninth Earl of Ellesmere, you said?â€

â€œWilliam Clarence Henry George,â€ Lord John agreed. â€œViscount Ashness, Master of Helwater, Baron Derwent, and, yes, ninth Earl of Ellesmere.â€

She pursed her lips.

â€œWhich would sort of indicate that the world at large thinks his father is somebody else. Not Jamie Fraser, I mean.â€

â€œWas somebody else,â€ he corrected. â€œOne Ludovic, eighth Earl of Ellesmere, to be precise. I understand that the eighth earl unfortunately died on the day his . . . er . . . his heir was born.â€

â€œDied of what? Shock?â€ She was clearly in a dangerous mood; he was interested to note both her fatherâ€™s manner of controlled ferocity and her motherâ€™s sharp tongue at workâ€”the combination was both fascinating and alarming. He hadnâ€™t any intention of allowing her to run this interview on her own terms, though.

â€œGunshot,â€ he said with affected cheerfulness. â€œYour father shot him.â€

She made a small choking noise and stopped dead.

â€œThat is not, by the way, common knowledge,â€ he said, affecting not to notice her reaction. â€œThe coronerâ€™s court returned a verdict of death by misadventureâ€”which was not incorrect, I believe.â€

â€œNot incorrect,â€ she murmured, sounding a trifle dazed. â€œI guess being shot is pretty misadventurous, all right.â€

â€œOf course there was talk,â€ he said, offhanded, taking her arm and urging her forward again. â€œBut the only witness, aside from Williamâ€™s grandparents, was an Irish coachman, who was rather quickly pensioned off to County Sligo, following the incident. The childâ€™s mother having also died that day, gossip was inclined to consider his lordshipâ€™s death asâ€”â€

â€œHis motherâ€™s dead, too?â€ She didnâ€™t stop this time, but turned to give him a penetrating glance from those deep blue eyes. Lord John had had sufficient practice in withstanding Fraser cat looks, though, and was not discomposed.

â€œHer name was Geneva Dunsany. She died shortly after Williamâ€™s birthâ€”of an entirely natural hemorrhage,â€ he assured her.

â€œEntirely natural,â€ she muttered, half under her breath. She shot him another look. â€œThis Genevaâ€”she was married to the earl? When she and Da . . .â€ The words seemed to stick in her throat; he could see doubt and repugnance struggling with her memories of Williamâ€™s undeniable faceâ€”and her knowledge of her fatherâ€™s character.

â€œHe has not told me, and I would in no circumstance ask him,â€ he said firmly. She gave him another of those looks, which he returned with interest. â€œWhatever the nature of Jamieâ€™s relations with Geneva Dunsany, I cannot conceive of his committing an act of such dishonor as to deceive another man in his marriage.â€

She relaxed fractionally, though her grip on his arm remained.

â€œNeither can I,â€ she said, rather grudgingly. â€œButâ€”â€ Her lips compressed, relaxed. â€œWas he in love with her, do you think?â€ she blurted.

What startled him was not the question, but the realization that it had never once occurred to him to ask itâ€”certainly not of Jamie, but not even of himself. Why not? he wondered. He had no right to jealousy, and if he was fool enough to suffer it, it would have been considerably ex post facto in the case of Geneva Dunsany; he had had no inkling of Williamâ€™s origins until several years after the girlâ€™s death.

â€œI have no idea,â€ he said shortly.

Briannaâ€™s fingers drummed restlessly on his arm; she would have pulled free, but he put a hand on hers to still her.

â€œDamn,â€ she muttered, but ceased fidgeting, and walked on, matching the length of his shorter stride. Weeds had sprung up in the oval, were sprouting through the sand of the track. She kicked at a clump of wild rye grass, sending a spray of dry seeds flying.

â€œIf they were in love, why didnâ€™t he marry her?â€ she asked at last.

He laughed, in sheer incredulity at the notion.

â€œMarry her! My dear girl, he was the family groom!â€

A look of puzzlement flashed in her eyeâ€”he would have sworn that if she had spoken, the word would have been â€œSo?â€

â€œWhere in the name of God were you raised?â€ he demanded, stopping dead.

He could see things moving in her eyes; she had Jamieâ€™s trick of keeping her face a mask, but her motherâ€™s transparency still shone from within. He saw the decision in her eyes, a moment before the slow smile touched her lips.

â€œBoston,â€ she said. â€œIâ€™m an American. But you knew I was a barbarian already, didnâ€™t you?â€

He grunted in response.

â€œThat does go some distance toward explaining your remarkably republican attitudes,â€ he replied very dryly. â€œThough I would strongly suggest that you disguise these dangerous sentiments, for the sake of your family. Your father is in sufficient trouble on his own account. However, you may accept my assurance that it would not be possible for the daughter of a baronet to marry a groom, no matter how exigent the nature of their emotions.â€

Her turn to grunt at that; a highly expressive, if totally unfeminine sound. He sighed, and took her hand again, tucking it in the curve of his elbow for safekeeping.

â€œHe was a paroled prisoner, tooâ€”a Jacobite, a traitor. Believe me, marriage would not have occurred to either of them.â€

The damp air was misting on her skin, clinging to the down hairs on her cheeks.

â€œBut that was in another country,â€ she quoted softly. â€œAnd besides, the wench is dead.â€

â€œVery true,â€ he said quietly.

They scuffed silently through the damp sand for a few moments, each alone in thought. At last Brianna heaved a sigh, deep enough that he felt as well as heard it.

â€œWell, sheâ€™s dead, anyway, and the earlâ€”do you know why Da killed him? Did he tell you that?â€

â€œYour father has never spoken of the matterâ€”of Geneva, of the earl, or even directly of Williamâ€™s parentageâ€”to me.â€ He spoke precisely, eyes fixed on a pair of gulls probing the sand near a clump of saw grass. â€œBut I know, yes.â€

He glanced at her.

â€œWilliam is my son, after all. In the sense of common usage, at least.â€ In a great deal more than that, but that was not a matter he chose to discuss with Jamieâ€™s daughter.

Her eyebrows rose.

â€œYes. How did that happen?â€

â€œAs I told you, both of Williamâ€™s parentsâ€”his putative parentsâ€”died on the day of his birth. His fatherâ€”the earl, I meanâ€”had no close kin, so the boy was left to the guardianship of his grandfather, Lord Dunsany. Genevaâ€™s sister, Isobel, became Williamâ€™s mother in all but fact. And Iâ€”â€ He shrugged, nonchalant. â€œI married Isobel. I became Williamâ€™s guardian, with Dunsanyâ€™s consent, and he has regarded me as his stepfather since he was six years oldâ€”he is my son.â€

â€œYou? You married?â€ She was goggling down at him, with an air of incredulity that he found offensive.

â€œYou have the most peculiar notions concerning marriage,â€ he said crossly. â€œIt was an eminently suitable match.â€

One red eyebrow went up in a gesture that was Jamie to the life.

â€œDid your wife think so?â€ she asked, in an uncanny echo of her motherâ€™s voice, asking the same question. When her mother had asked it, he had been nonplussed. This time, he was prepared.

â€œThat,â€ he said tersely, â€œwas in another country. And Isobel . . .â€ As he had hoped, that silenced her.

A fire was burning at the far end of the sandy oval, where travelers had made a rough camp. People come downriver to see the execution, he wondered? Men seeking to enlist in the rebel militias? A figure moved, dimly seen through the haze of smoke, and he turned, leading Brianna back along the way they had come. This conversation was sufficiently awkward, without the risk of interruption.

â€œYou asked about Ellesmere,â€ he said, taking control of the conversation once more. â€œThe story given to the coronerâ€™s court by Lord Dunsany was that Ellesmere had been showing him a new pistol, which discharged by accident. It was the sort of story that is told in order to be disbelievedâ€”giving the impression that in reality the earl had shot himself, doubtless from grief at the death of his wife, but that the Dunsanys wished to avoid the stigma of suicide, for the sake of the child. The coroner naturally perceived both the falsity of the story and the wisdom of allowing it to stand.â€

â€œThatâ€™s not what I asked,â€ she said, a noticeable edge in her voice. â€œI asked why my father shot him.â€

He sighed. She could have found gainful employment with the Spanish Inquisition, he thought ruefully; no chance of escape or evasion.

â€œI understand that his Lordship, apprehending that the newborn infant was in fact not of his blood, intended to expunge the stain upon his honor by dropping the child out of the window, onto the slates in the courtyard thirty feet below,â€ he said bluntly.

Her face had paled perceptibly.

â€œHow did he find out?â€ she demanded. â€œAnd if Da was a groom, why was he there? Did the earl know he wasâ€”responsible?â€ She shuddered, plainly envisioning a scene in which Jamie was summoned to the earlâ€™s presence, to witness the death of his illegitimate offspring before facing a similar fate himself. John had no difficulty in discerning her imagination; he had envisioned such a scene himself, more than once.

â€œAn acute choice of words,â€ he replied dryly. â€œJamie Fraser is â€˜responsibleâ€™ for more than any man I know. As to the rest, I have no idea. I know the essentials of what happened, because Isobel knew; her mother was present and presumably told her only the briefest outline of the incident.â€

â€œHuh.â€ She kicked a small stone, deliberately. It skittered across the packed sand in front of her, ending a few feet away. â€œAnd you never asked Da about it?â€

The stone lay in his line of march; he kicked it neatly as he walked, rolling it back into her path.

â€œI have never spoken to your father regarding Geneva, Ellesmere, or William himselfâ€”save to inform him of my marriage to Isobel and to assure him that I would fulfill my responsibilities as Williamâ€™s guardian to the best of my ability.â€

She set her foot on the stone, driving it into the soft sand, and stopped.

â€œYou never said anything to him? What did he say to you?â€ she demanded.

â€œNothing.â€ He returned her stare.

â€œWhy did you marry Isobel?â€

He sighed, but there was no point in evasion.

â€œIn order to take care of William.â€

The thick red brows nearly touched her hairline.

â€œSo you got married, in spite ofâ€”I mean, you turned your whole life upside down, just to take care of Jamie Fraserâ€™s illegitimate son? And neither one of you ever talked about it?â€

â€œNo,â€ he said, baffled. â€œOf course not.â€

Slowly, the brows came down again, and she shook her head.

â€œMen,â€ she said cryptically. She glanced back toward the town. The air was calm, and a haze from the chimneys of Wilmington lay heavy above the trees. No roofs showed; it might have been a dragon that lay sleeping on the shore, for all that could be seen. The low, rumbling noise was not a reptilian snore, though; a small but constant stream of people had been passing by the track, headed for the town, and the reverberations of an increasing crowd were clearly audible, whenever the wind was right.

â€œItâ€™s nearly dark. I have to go back.â€ She turned toward the lane that led into town, and he followed, relieved for the moment, but under no illusion that the inquisition was over.

She had only one more question, though.

â€œWhen are you going to tell him?â€ she asked, turning to look at him as she reached the edge of the trees.

â€œTell who what?â€ he replied, startled.

â€œHim.â€ She frowned at him, irritated. â€œWilliam. My brother.â€ The irritation faded as she tasted the word. She was still pale, but a sort of excitement had begun to glow beneath her skin. Lord John felt as though he had eaten something that violently disagreed with him. A cold sweat broke out along his jaw, and his guts clenched into fistlike knots. His knees turned to water.

â€œAre you quite mad?â€ He grasped at her arm, as much to keep from stumbling as to prevent her going off.

â€œI gather he doesnâ€™t know who his father really is,â€ she said with a bit of asperity. â€œGiven that you and Da never talked to each other about it, you probably didnâ€™t see any point talking to him, either. But heâ€™s grown up nowâ€”he has a right to know, surely.â€

Lord John closed his eyes with a low moan.

â€œAre you all right?â€ she asked. He felt her bending close to inspect him. â€œYou donâ€™t look very good.â€

â€œSit.â€ He sat himself, back to a tree, and pulled her down beside him on the ground. He breathed deeply, keeping his eyes closed while his mind raced. Surely she was joking? Surely not, his cynically observant self assured him. She had a marked sense of humor, but it wasnâ€™t in evidence at the moment.

She couldnâ€™t. He couldnâ€™t let her. It was inconceivable that sheâ€”but how could he stop her? If she wouldnâ€™t listen to him, perhaps Jamie or her mother . . .

A hand touched his shoulder.

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ she said softly. â€œI didnâ€™t stop to think.â€

Relief filled him. He felt his bowels begin to uncramp, and opened his eyes to see her gazing at him with a peculiar sort of limpid sympathy that he didnâ€™t understand at all. His bowels promptly convulsed again, making him fear that he was about to suffer an embarrassing attack of flatulence on the spot.

His bowels had read her better than he had.

â€œI should have thought,â€ she reproached herself. â€œI should have known how youâ€™d feel about it. You said it yourselfâ€”heâ€™s your son. Youâ€™ve raised him all this time, I can see how much you love him. It must make you feel terrible to think of William finding out about Da and maybe blaming you for not telling him sooner.â€ Her hand was massaging his collarbone in what he assumed was meant to be a soothing gesture. If that was her intent, the movement had singularly failed.

â€œButâ€”â€ he began, but she had taken his hand in both hers and was squeezing it earnestly, her blue eyes shimmering with tears.

â€œHe wonâ€™t,â€ she assured him. â€œWilliam would never stop loving you. Believe me. It was the same for meâ€”when I found out about Da. I didnâ€™t want to believe it at first; I had a father, and I loved him, and I didnâ€™t want another one. But then I met Da, and it wasâ€”he was . . . who he isâ€”â€ She shrugged slightly, and lifted one hand to wipe her eyes on the lace at her wrist.

â€œBut I havenâ€™t forgotten my other father,â€ she said very softly. â€œI never will. Never.â€

Touched despite the general seriousness of the situation, Lord John cleared his throat.

â€œYes. Well. I am sure your sentiments do you great credit, my dear. And while I hope that I likewise enjoy Williamâ€™s affectionate regard at present and will continue to do so in future, that is really not the point I was endeavoring to make.â€

â€œItâ€™s not?â€ She looked up, wide-eyed, tears clumping her lashes into dark spikes. She was really a lovely young woman, and he felt a small twinge of tenderness.

â€œNo,â€ he said, quite gently under the circumstances. â€œLook, my love. I told you who William isâ€”or who he thinks he is.â€

â€œViscount Whatnot, you mean?â€

He sighed deeply.

â€œQuite. The five people who know of his true parentage have expended considerable effort for the last eighteeen years, to the end that no oneâ€”William includedâ€”should ever have cause to doubt that he is the ninth Earl of Ellesmere.â€

She looked down at that, her thick brows knitted, lips compressed. Christ, he hoped that her husband had succeeded in locating Jamie Fraser in time. Jamie Fraser was the only person who had a hope of being more effectually stubborn than his daughter.

â€œYou donâ€™t understand,â€ she said finally. She looked up, and he saw that she had come to some decision.

â€œWeâ€™re leaving,â€ she said abruptly. â€œRoger and I and theâ€”the children.â€

â€œOh?â€ he said cautiously. This might be good newsâ€”on several counts. â€œWhere do you propose to go? Will you remove to England? Or Scotland? If England or Canada, I have several social connexions who might be ofâ€”â€

â€œNo. Not there. Not anywhere you have â€˜connexions.â€™â€ She smiled painfully at him, then swallowed before continuing.

â€œBut you seeâ€”weâ€™ll be gone. Forâ€”for good. I wonâ€™tâ€”I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever see you again.â€ That realization had just dawned on her; he saw it on her face, and despite the strength of the pang it gave him, he was deeply moved by her obvious distress at the thought.

â€œI will miss you very much, Brianna,â€ he said gently. He had been a soldier most of his life, and then a diplomat. He had learned to live with separation and absence, with the occasional death of friends left behind. But the notion of never seeing this odd girl again caused him a most unexpected degree of grief. Almost, he thought with surprise, as though she were his own daughter.

But he had a son, as well, and her next words snapped him back to full alertness.

â€œSo you see,â€ she said, leaning toward him with an intentness that he would otherwise have found charming, â€œI have to talk to William, and tell him. Weâ€™ll never have another chance.â€ Then her face changed, and she put a hand to her bosom.

â€œI have to go,â€ she said abruptly. â€œMandyâ€”Amanda, my daughterâ€”she needs to be fed.â€

And with that, she was up and gone, scudding across the sand of the racetrack like a storm cloud, leaving the threat of destruction and upheaval in her wake.

SURELY JUSTICE AND MERCY

SHALL FOLLOW ME




July 10, 1776

THE TIDE TURNED FROM THE EBB just before five oâ€™clock in the morning. The sky was fully light, a clear pale color without clouds, and the mudflats beyond the quay stretched gray and shining, their smoothness marred here and there by weed and stubborn sea grass, sprouting from the mud like clumps of hair.

Everyone rose with the dawn; there were plenty of people on the quay to see the small procession go out, two officers from the Wilmington Committee of Safety, a representative from the Merchants Association, a minister carrying a Bible, and the prisoner, a tall, wide-shouldered figure, walking bare-headed across the stinking mud. Behind them all came a slave, carrying the ropes.

â€œI donâ€™t want to watch this,â€ Brianna said under her breath. She was very pale, her arms folded over her middle as though she had a stomachache.

â€œLetâ€™s go, then.â€ Roger took her arm, but she pulled back.

â€œNo. I have to.â€

She dropped her arms and stood straight, watching. People around them were jostling for a better view, jeering and catcalling so loudly that whatever was said out there was inaudible. It didnâ€™t take long. The slave, a big man, grabbed the mooring post and shook it, testing for steadfastness. Then stood back, while the two officers backed Stephen Bonnet up to the stake and wrapped his body with rope from chest to knees. The bastard wasnâ€™t going anywhere.

Roger thought he should be searching his heart for compassion, praying for the man. He couldnâ€™t. Tried to ask forgiveness, and couldnâ€™t do that, either. Something like a ball of worms churned in his belly. He felt as though he were himself tied to a stake, waiting to drown.

The black-coated minister leaned close, his hair whipping in the early morning breeze, mouth moving. Roger didnâ€™t think that Bonnet made any reply, but couldnâ€™t tell for sure. After a few moments, the men doffed their hats, stood while the minister prayed, then put them on again and headed back toward shore, their boots squelching, ankle-deep in the sandy mud.

The moment the officials had disappeared, a stream of people poured out onto the mud: sightseers, hopping childrenâ€”and a man with a notebook and pencil, who Roger recognized as Amos Crupp, the current proprietor of the Wilmington Gazette.

â€œWell, thatâ€™ll be a scoop, wonâ€™t it?â€ Roger muttered. No matter what Bonnet actually saidâ€”or didnâ€™tâ€”there would undoubtedly be a broadsheet hawked through the streets tomorrow, containing either a lurid confession or mawkish reports of remorseâ€”perhaps both.

â€œOkay, I really canâ€™t watch this.â€ Abruptly, Brianna turned, taking his arm.

She made it past the row of warehouses before turning abruptly to him, burying her face in his chest and bursting into tears.

â€œSsh. Itâ€™s okayâ€”itâ€™s going to be all right.â€ He patted her, tried to infuse some conviction into the words, but his own throat had a lump in it the size of a lemon. He finally took her by the shoulders and held her away from him, so that he could look into her eyes.

â€œYe donâ€™t have to do it,â€ he said.

She stopped crying and sniffed, wiping her nose on her sleeve like Jemmyâ€”but wouldnâ€™t meet his eyes.

â€œItâ€™sâ€”Iâ€™m okay Itâ€™s not even him. Itâ€™s justâ€”just everything. M-Mandyâ€â€”her voice wavered on the wordâ€”â€œand meeting my brotherâ€”Oh, Roger, if I canâ€™t tell him, heâ€™ll never know, and Iâ€™ll never see him or Lord John again. Or Mamaâ€”â€ Fresh tears overwhelmed her, welling up in her eyes, but she gulped and swallowed, forcing them back.

â€œItâ€™s not him,â€ she said in a choked, exhausted voice.

â€œMaybe itâ€™s not,â€ he said softly. â€œBut ye still donâ€™t have to do it.â€ His stomach still churned, and his hands felt shaky, but resolution filled him.

â€œI should have killed him on Ocracoke,â€ she said, closing her eyes and brushing back strands of loosened hair. The sun was higher now, and bright. â€œI was a coward. I th-thought it would be easier to letâ€”let the law do it.â€ She opened her eyes, and now did meet his gaze, her eyes reddened but clear. â€œI canâ€™t let it happen this way, even if I hadnâ€™t given my word.â€

Roger understood that; he felt the terror of the tide coming in, that inexorable creep of water, rising in his bones. It would be nearly nine hours before the water reached Bonnetâ€™s chin; he was a tall man.

â€œIâ€™ll do it,â€ he said very firmly.

She made a small attempt at a smile, but abandoned it.

â€œNo,â€ she said. â€œYou wonâ€™t.â€ She lookedâ€”and soundedâ€”absolutely drained; neither of them had slept much the night before. But she also sounded determined, and he recognized Jamie Fraserâ€™s stubborn blood.

Well, what the hellâ€”he had some of that blood, too.

â€œI told ye,â€ he said. â€œWhat your father said, that time. â€˜It is myself who kills for her.â€™ If it has to be doneâ€â€”and he was obliged to agree with her; he couldnâ€™t stand it, eitherâ€”â€œthen Iâ€™ll do it.â€

She was getting a grip on herself. She wiped her face with a fold of her skirt, and took a deep breath before meeting his eyes again. Hers were deep and vivid blue, much darker than the sky.

â€œYou told me. And you told me why he said that, tooâ€”what he said to Arch Bug: â€˜There is a vow upon her.â€™ Sheâ€™s a doctor; she doesnâ€™t kill people.â€

The hell she doesnâ€™t, Roger thought, but better judgment prevented his saying so. Before he could think of something more tactful, she went on, placing her hands flat on his chest.

â€œYou have one, too,â€ she said. That stopped him cold.

â€œNo, I havenâ€™t.â€

â€œOh, yes, you do.â€ She was quietly emphatic. â€œMaybe it isnâ€™t official yetâ€”but it doesnâ€™t need to be. Maybe it doesnâ€™t even have words, the vow that you tookâ€”but you did it, and I know it.â€

He couldnâ€™t deny it, and was moved that she did know it.

â€œAye, well . . .â€ He put his hands over hers, clasping her long, strong fingers. â€œAnd I made one to you, too, when I told ye. I said I would never put God before myâ€”my love for you.â€ Love. He couldnâ€™t believe that he was discussing such a thing in terms of love. And yet, he had the queerest feeling that that was exactly how she saw it.

â€œI donâ€™t have that sort of vow,â€ she said firmly, and pulled her hands out of his. â€œAnd I gave my word.â€

She had gone with Jamie after dark the night before, to the place where the pirate was being held. Roger had no idea what sort of bribery or force of personality had been employed, but they had been admitted. Jamie had brought her back to their room very late, white-faced, with a sheaf of papers that she handed over to her father. Affidavits, she said; sworn statements of Stephen Bonnetâ€™s business dealings with various merchants up and down the coast.

Roger had given Jamie a murderous look, and got the same back, with interest. This is war, Fraserâ€™s narrowed eyes had said. And I will use any weapon I can. But all he had said was, â€œGood night, then, a nighean,â€ and touched her hair with tenderness before departing.

Brianna had sat down with Mandy and nursed her, eyes closed, refusing to speak. After a time, her face eased from its white, strained lines, and she burped the baby and laid her sleeping in her basket. Then she came to bed, and made love to him with a silent fierceness that surprised him. But not as much as she surprised him now.

â€œAnd thereâ€™s one other thing,â€ she said, sober and slightly sad. â€œIâ€™m the only person in the world for whom this isnâ€™t murder.â€

With that, she turned and walked away fast, toward the inn where Mandy waited to be fed. Out on the mudflats, he could still hear the sound of excited voices, raucous as gulls.



AT TWO Oâ€™CLOCK in the afternoon, Roger helped his wife into a small rowboat, tied to the quay near the row of warehouses. The tide had been coming in all day; the water was more than five feet deep. Out in the midst of the shining gray stood the cluster of mooring postsâ€”and the small dark head of the pirate.

Brianna was remote as a pagan statue, her face expressionless. She lifted her skirts to step into the boat, and sat down, the weight in her pocket clunking against the wooden slat as she did so.

Roger took up the oars and rowed, heading toward the posts. They would arouse no particular interest; boats had been going out ever since noon, carrying sightseers who wished to look upon the condemned manâ€™s face, shout taunts, or clip a strand of his hair for a souvenir.

He couldnâ€™t see where he was going; Brianna directed him left or right with a silent tilt of her head. She could see; she sat straight and tall, her right hand hidden in her skirt.

Then she lifted her left hand suddenly, and Roger lay on the oars, digging with one to slew the tiny craft around.

Bonnetâ€™s lips were cracked, his face chapped and crusted with salt, his lids so reddened that he could barely open his eyes. But his head lifted as they drew near, and Roger saw a man ravished, helpless and dreading a coming embraceâ€”so much that he half welcomes its seductive touch, yielding his flesh to cold fingers and the overwhelming kiss that steals his breath.

â€œYeâ€™ve left it late enough, darlinâ€™,â€ he said to Brianna, and the cracked lips parted in a grin that split them and left blood on his teeth. â€œI knew yeâ€™d come, though.â€

Roger paddled with one oar, working the boat close, then closer. He was looking over his shoulder when Brianna drew the gilt-handled pistol from her pocket, and put the barrel to Stephen Bonnetâ€™s ear.

â€œGo with God, Stephen,â€ she said clearly, in Gaelic, and pulled the trigger. Then she dropped the gun into the water and turned round to face her husband.

â€œTake us home,â€ she said.

REGRET




LORD JOHN STEPPED INTO HIS ROOM at the inn, and was surprisedâ€”astonished, in factâ€”to discover that he had a visitor.

â€œJohn.â€ Jamie Fraser turned from the window, and gave him a small smile.

â€œJamie.â€ He returned it, trying to control the sudden sense of elation he felt. He had used Jamie Fraserâ€™s Christian name perhaps three times in the last twenty-five years; the intimacy of it was exhilarating, but he mustnâ€™t let it show.

â€œWill I order us refreshment?â€ he asked politely. Jamie had not moved from the window; he glanced out, then back at John and shook his head, still smiling faintly.

â€œI thank ye, no. We are enemies, are we not?â€

â€œWe find ourselves regrettably upon opposing sides of what I trust will be a short-lived conflict,â€ Lord John corrected.

Fraser looked down at him, with an odd, regretful sort of expression.

â€œNot short,â€ he said. â€œBut regrettable, aye.â€

â€œIndeed.â€ Lord John cleared his throat, and moved to the window, careful not to brush against his visitor. He looked out, and saw the likely reason for Fraserâ€™s visit.

â€œAh,â€ he said, seeing Brianna Fraser MacKenzie on the wooden sidewalk below. â€œOh!â€ he said, in a different tone. For William Clarence Henry George Ransom, ninth Earl of Ellesmere, had just come out of the inn and bowed to her.

â€œSweet Jesus,â€ he said, apprehension making his scalp prickle. â€œWill she tell him?â€

Fraser shook his head, his eyes on the two young people below.

â€œShe will not,â€ he said quietly. â€œShe gave me her word.â€

Relief coursed through his veins like water.

â€œThank you,â€ he said. Fraser shrugged slightly, dismissing it. It was, after all, what he desired, as wellâ€”or so Lord John assumed.

The two of them were talking togetherâ€”William said something and Brianna laughed, throwing back her hair. Jamie watched in fascination. Dear God, they were alike! The small tricks of expression, of posture, of gesture . . . It must be apparent to the most casual observer. In fact, he saw a couple pass them and the woman smile, pleased at the sight of the handsome matched pair.

â€œShe will not tell him,â€ Lord John repeated, somewhat dismayed by the sight. â€œBut she displays herself to him. Will he notâ€”but no. I donâ€™t suppose he will.â€

â€œI hope not,â€ Jamie said, eyes still fixed on them. â€œBut if he doesâ€”he still will not know. And she insisted she must see him once moreâ€”that was the price of her silence.â€

John nodded, silent. Briannaâ€™s husband was coming now, their little boy held by one hand, his hair as vivid as his motherâ€™s in the bright summer sun. He held a baby in the crook of his armâ€”Brianna took it from him, turning back the blanket to display the child to William, who inspected it with every indication of politeness.

He realized suddenly that every fragment of Fraserâ€™s being was focused on the scene outside. Of course; he had not seen Willie since the boy was twelve. And to see the two togetherâ€”his daughter and the son he could never speak to or acknowledge. He would have touched Fraser, put a hand on his arm in sympathy, but knowing the probable effect of his touch, forbore to do it.

â€œI have come,â€ Fraser said suddenly, â€œto ask a favor of you.â€

â€œI am your servant, sir,â€ Lord John said, terribly pleased, but taking refuge in formality.

â€œNot for myself,â€ Fraser said with a glance at him. â€œFor Brianna.â€

â€œMy pleasure will be the greater,â€ John assured him. â€œI am exceeding fond of your daughter, her temperamental resemblances to her sire notwithstanding.â€

The corner of Fraserâ€™s mouth lifted, and he returned his gaze to the scene below.

â€œIndeed,â€ he said. â€œWell, then. I canna tell ye why I require thisâ€”but I need a jewel.â€

â€œA jewel?â€ Lord Johnâ€™s voice sounded blank, even to his own ears. â€œWhat sort of jewel?â€

â€œAny sort.â€ Fraser shrugged, impatient. â€œIt doesna matterâ€”so long as it should be some precious gem. I once gave ye such a stoneâ€”â€ His mouth twitched at that; he had handed over the stone, a sapphire, under duress, as a prisoner of the Crown. â€œThough I dinna suppose yeâ€™d have that by ye, still.â€

In point of fact, he did. That particular sapphire had traveled with him for the last twenty-five years, and was at this moment in the pocket of his waistcoat.

He glanced at his left hand, which bore a broad gold band, set with a brilliant, faceted sapphire. Hectorâ€™s ring. Given to him by his first lover at the age of sixteen. Hector had died at Cullodenâ€”the day after John had met James Fraser, in the dark of a Scottish mountain pass.

Without hesitation, but with some difficultyâ€”the ring had been worn a long time, and had sunk a little way into the flesh of his fingerâ€”he twisted it off and dropped it into Jamieâ€™s hand.

Fraserâ€™s brows rose in astonishment.

â€œThis? Are ye surâ€”â€

â€œTake it.â€ He reached out then, and closed Jamieâ€™s fingers around it with his own. The contact was fleeting, but his hand tingled, and he closed his own fist, hoping to keep the sensation.

â€œThank you,â€ Jamie said again, quietly.

â€œIt isâ€”my very great pleasure.â€ The party below was breaking upâ€”Brianna was taking her leave, the baby held in her arms, her husband and son already halfway down the walk. William bowed, hat off, the shape of his chestnut head so perfectly echoing that of the redâ€”

Suddenly, Lord John could not bear to see them part. He wished to keep that, tooâ€”the sight of them together. He closed his eyes and stood, hands on the sill, feeling the movement of the breeze past his face. Something touched his shoulder, very briefly, and he felt a sense of movement in the air beside him.

When he opened his eyes again, all three of them were gone.

LOTH TO DEPART




September 1776

ROGER WAS LAYING THE LAST OF the water pipes when Aidan and Jemmy popped up beside him, sudden as a pair of jack-in-the-boxes.

â€œDaddy, Daddy, Bobbyâ€™s here!â€

â€œWhat, Bobby Higgins?â€ Roger straightened up, feeling his back muscles protest, and looked toward the Big House, but saw no sign of a horse. â€œWhere is he?â€

â€œHe went up to the graveyard,â€ Aidan said, looking important. â€œDâ€™ye think heâ€™s gone to look for the ghost?â€

â€œI doubt it,â€ Roger said calmly. â€œWhat ghost?â€

â€œMalva Christieâ€™s,â€ Aidan said promptly. â€œShe walks. Everybody says so.â€ He spoke bravely, but wrapped his arms about himself. Jemmy, who plainly hadnâ€™t heard that bit of news before, looked wide-eyed.

â€œWhy does she walk? Whereâ€™s she going?â€

â€œBecause she was murrrrderrred, silly,â€ Aidan said. â€œFolk what are murdered always walk. Theyâ€™re lookinâ€™ for the one who killed them.â€

â€œNonsense,â€ Roger said firmly, seeing the uneasy look on Jemmyâ€™s face. Jem had known Malva Christie was dead, of course; heâ€™d gone to her funeral, along with all the other children on the Ridge. But he and Brianna had simply told the boy that Malva had died, not that she had been murdered.

Well, Roger thought grimly, little hope of keeping something like that secret. He hoped Jem wouldnâ€™t have nightmares.

â€œMalvaâ€™s not walking about looking for anyone,â€ he said, with as much conviction as he could infuse into his voice. â€œHer soul is in heaven with Jesus, where sheâ€™s happy and peacefulâ€”and her body . . . well, when people die, they donâ€™t need their bodies anymore, and so we bury them, and there they stay, all tidy in their graves, until the Last Day.â€

Aidan looked patently unconvinced by this.

â€œJoey McLaughlin saw her, two weeks ago Friday,â€ he said, bobbing up and down on his toes. â€œA-flittinâ€™ through the wood, he said, all dressed in blackâ€”and howlinâ€™ most mournful!â€

Jemmy was beginning to look truly upset. Roger laid down the spade, and picked Jem up in his arms.

â€œI expect Joey McLaughlin was a bit the worse for a dram too much,â€ he said. Both boys were entirely familiar with the concept of drunkenness. â€œIf it was flitting through the wood howling, it was most likely Rollo he saw. Come on, though, weâ€™ll go find Bobby, and yeâ€™ll see Malvaâ€™s grave for yourselves.â€

He put out a hand to Aidan, who took it happily and chattered like a magpie all the way up the hill.

And what was Aidan going to do, when he left? he wondered. The idea of leaving, at first so abrupt as to seem completely unreal, unthinkable, had been filtering into his consciousness, day by day. As he worked at the chores, dug the trenches for Briannaâ€™s water pipes, carried hay, chopped wood, he would try to think: â€œNot much longer.â€ And yet it seemed impossible that one day he would not be on the Ridge, would not push open the door to the cabin and find Brianna involved in some fiendish experiment on the kitchen table, Jem and Aidan madly vrooming around her feet.

The feeling of unreality was even more pronounced when he preached of a Sunday or went round as ministerâ€”if yet without portfolioâ€”to visit the sick or counsel the troubled. Looking into all those facesâ€”attentive, excited, bored, dour, or preoccupiedâ€”he simply couldnâ€™t believe that he meant to go, callously to abandon them all. How would he tell them? he wondered, with a sort of anguish at the thought. Especially the ones he felt most responsible forâ€”Aidan and his mother.

Heâ€™d prayed about it, looking for strength, for guidance.

And yet . . . and yet the vision of Amandaâ€™s tiny blue fingernails, the faint wheeze of her breathing, never left him. And the looming stones by the creek on Ocracoke seemed to grow nearer, more solid, day by day.

Bobby Higgins was indeed in the graveyard, his horse tethered under the pines. He was sitting by Malvaâ€™s grave, head bowed in contemplation, though he looked up at once when Roger and the boys appeared. He looked pale and somber, but scrambled to his feet and shook Rogerâ€™s hand.

â€œIâ€™m glad to see ye back, Bobby. Here, you lot go and play, aye?â€ He set Jemmy down, and was pleased to see that after one suspicious glance at Malvaâ€™s graveâ€”adorned with a wilted bunch of wildflowersâ€”Jemmy went off quite happily with Aidan to hunt for squirrels and chipmunks in the wood.

â€œIâ€”erâ€”wasnâ€™t expecting to see you again,â€ he added a little awkwardly. Bobby looked down, slowly dusting pine needles from his breeches.

â€œWell, zur . . . the fact of the matter is, Iâ€™ve come to stay. If so be as thatâ€™s agreeable,â€ he added hastily.

â€œTo stay? Butâ€”of course itâ€™s fine,â€ Roger said, recovering from his surprise. â€œHave youâ€”that isâ€”youâ€™ve not had a falling-out with his Lordship, I hope?â€

Bobby looked astonished at the thought, and shook his head decidedly.

â€œOh, no, zur! His Lordshipâ€™s been proper kind to me, ever since he took me on.â€ He hesitated, biting his lower lip. â€œItâ€™s onlyâ€”well, ye see, zur, thereâ€™s a deal of folk what come to stay with his Lordship these days. Politicals, andâ€”and army folk.â€

Despite himself, he touched the brand on his cheek, which had faded now to a pinkish scar but was still apparentâ€”and always would be. Roger understood.

â€œYou werenâ€™t comfortable there any longer, I suppose?â€

â€œThatâ€™s it, zur.â€ Bobby gave him a grateful look. â€œTime was, â€™twas just his Lordship and me and Manoke the cook. Sometimes a guest would come for dinner or to stay a few days, but â€™twas all easy and what ye might call simple. When I went for to run messages or errands for his Lordship, folk would stare, but only for the first time or two; after that, theyâ€™d be used to thisâ€â€”he touched his face againâ€”â€œand it was all right. But now . . .â€ He trailed off unhappily, leaving Roger to imagine the probable response of British army officers, starched, polished, and either openly disapproving of this blot on the serviceâ€”or painfully polite.

â€œHis Lordship saw the difficulty; heâ€™s good that way. And he said as how he would miss me, but if I chose to seek my fortune elsewhere, he would give me ten pounds and his best wishes.â€

Roger whistled respectfully. Ten pounds was a very respectable sum. Not a fortune, but quite enough to set Bobby on his road.

â€œVery nice,â€ he said. â€œDid he know ye meant to come here?â€

Bobby shook his head.

â€œI wasnâ€™t sure myself,â€ he admitted. â€œOnce, I shouldâ€”â€ He cut himself off abruptly, with a glance at Malvaâ€™s grave, then turned back to Roger, clearing his throat.

â€œI thought I best talk to Mr. Fraser, before I was to make up my mind. Could be thereâ€™s naught for me here any longer, either.â€ This was phrased as a statement, but the question was clear. Everyone on the Ridge knew Bobby and accepted him; that wasnâ€™t the difficulty. But with Lizzie married and Malva gone . . . Bobby wanted a wife.

â€œOh . . . I think ye might find yourself welcome,â€ Roger said with a thoughtful look at Aidan, hanging upside down by his knees from a tree branch, while Jemmy pegged pinecones at him. A most peculiar feeling went through himâ€”something between gratitude and jealousyâ€”but he pushed the latter feeling firmly down.

â€œAidan!â€ he shouted. â€œJem! Time to go!â€ And turned casually back to Bobby, saying, â€œI think yeâ€™ll maybe not have met Aidanâ€™s mother, Amy McCallumâ€”a young widow, aye, with a house and a bit of land. Sheâ€™s come to work at the Big House; if yeâ€™ll come sit down to supper there . . .â€



â€œIâ€™VE THOUGHT OF IT now and then,â€ Jamie admitted. â€œWondered, ye ken? What if I could? How would it be?â€

He glanced at Brianna, smiling, but a little helpless, and shrugged.

â€œWhat dâ€™ye think, lass? What should I do there? How would it be?â€

â€œWell, itâ€”â€ she began, and stopped, trying to envision him in that worldâ€”behind the wheel of a car? Going to an office, in a three-piece suit? That idea was so ludicrous, she laughed. Or sitting in a darkened theater, watching Godzilla films with Jem and Roger?

â€œWhatâ€™s Jamie spelled backward?â€ she asked.

â€œEimaj, I suppose,â€ he replied, bewildered. â€œWhy?â€

â€œI think youâ€™d do fine,â€ she said, smiling. â€œNever mind. Youâ€™dâ€”well, I suppose you could . . . publish newspapers. The printing presses are bigger and faster, and it takes a lot more people to gather the news, but otherwiseâ€”I donâ€™t think itâ€™s so different then from what it is now. You know how to do that.â€

He nodded, a crease of concentration forming between the thick brows that were so like hers.

â€œI suppose so,â€ he said a little dubiously. â€œCould I be a farmer, dâ€™ye think? Surely folk still eat; someone must feed them.â€

â€œYou could.â€ She looked round, taking fresh note of all the homely details of the place: the chickens scratching peaceably in the dirt; the soft, weathered boards of the stable; the thrown-up dirt near the foundation of the house where the white pig had burrowed in. â€œThere are people then who still farm just this way; small places, way up in the mountains. Itâ€™s a hard lifeâ€”â€ She saw him smile, and laughed in return. â€œAll right, itâ€™s not any harder than it is nowâ€”but itâ€™s a lot easier in the cities.â€

She paused, thinking.

â€œYou wouldnâ€™t have to fight,â€ she said finally.

He seemed surprised at that.

â€œNo? But ye did say there are wars.â€

â€œThere certainly are,â€ she said, needles of ice piercing her belly, as the images pierced her mind: fields of poppies, fields of white crossesâ€”a man on fire, a naked child running with burned skin, the contorted face of a man in the instant before the bullet entered his brain. â€œButâ€”but then itâ€™s only the young men who fight. And not all of them; only some.â€

â€œMmphm.â€ He thought for a bit, his brow furrowed, then looked up searching her face.

â€œThis world of yours, this America,â€ he said finally, matter-of-factly. â€œThe freedom that ye go to. There will be a fearful price to be paid. Will it be worth it, do ye think?â€

It was her turn then to be silent and think. At last she put her hand on his armâ€”solid, warm, steady as iron.

â€œAlmost nothing would be worth losing you,â€ she whispered. â€œBut maybe that comes close.â€



AS THE WORLD turns toward winter and the nights grow long, people begin to wake in the dark. Lying in bed too long cramps the limbs, and dreams dreamt too long turn inward on themselves, grotesque as a Mandarinâ€™s fingernails. By and large, the human body isnâ€™t adapted for more than seven or eight hoursâ€™ sleepâ€”but what happens when the nights are longer than that?

What happens is the second sleep. You fall asleep from tiredness, soon after darkâ€”but then wake again, rising toward the surface of your dreams like a trout coming up to feed. And should your sleeping partner also wake thenâ€”and people who have slept together for a good many years know at once when each other wakesâ€”you have a small, private place to share, deep in the night. A place in which to rise, to stretch, to bring a juicy apple back to bed, to share slice by slice, fingers brushing lips. To have the luxury of conversation, uninterrupted by the business of the day. To make love slowly in the light of an autumn moon.

And then, to lie close, and let a loverâ€™s dreams caress your skin as you begin to sink once more beneath the waves of consciousness, blissful in the knowledge that dawn is far offâ€”thatâ€™s second sleep.

I came very slowly to the surface of my first sleep, to find that the highly erotic dream I had been having had some basis in reality.

â€œIâ€™d never thought myself the sort whoâ€™d molest a corpse, Sassenach.â€ Jamieâ€™s voice tickled the tender flesh below my ear, murmuring. â€œBut I will say the notion has more appeal than Iâ€™d thought.â€

I wasnâ€™t sufficiently coherent as to respond to this, but thrust my hips back toward him in a fashion that he seemed to find as eloquent an invitation as one written in calligraphy on parchment. He took a deep breath, a firm grip on my buttocks, and brought me to an awakening that could be called rude in several senses of the word.

I squirmed like a worm impaled on a fish-hook, making small urgent noises that he interpreted correctly, rolling me onto my face and proceeding to leave me in no doubt that I was not merely alive and awake, but functioning.

I emerged at length from a nest of flattened pillows, damp, gasping, quivering in every engorged and slippery nerve-ending, and thoroughly awake.

â€œWhat brought that on?â€ I inquired. He hadnâ€™t pulled away; we lay still joined, washed in the light of a big golden half-moon, riding low in the sky above the chestnut trees. He made a small sound, partly amusement, partly dismay.

â€œI canna look at ye asleep without wanting to wake ye, Sassenach.â€ His hand cupped my breast, gently now. â€œI suppose I find myself lonely without ye.â€

There was an odd note in his voice, and I turned my head toward him, but couldnâ€™t see him in the dark behind me. Instead, I put back a hand and touched the leg still wrapped halfway over mine. Even relaxed, it was hard, the long groove of the muscle graceful under my fingers.

â€œIâ€™m here,â€ I said, and his arm tightened suddenly round me.



I HEARD THE BREATH catch in his throat, and my hand tightened on his thigh.

â€œWhat is it?â€ I said.

He drew breath, but didnâ€™t answer at once. I felt him draw back a little, and fumble under the pillow. Then his hand came round me again, but this time seeking the hand that lay on his leg. His fingers curled into mine, and I felt a small, hard, roundish object thrust into my hand.

I heard him swallow.

The stone, whatever it was, seemed slightly warm to the touch. I ran a thumb slowly over it; a raw stone of some kind, but big, the size of one of my finger-joints.

â€œJamie . . .â€ I said, feeling my throat close.

â€œI love you,â€ he said, so softly that I barely heard him, close as we were.

I lay still for a moment, feeling the stone grow warmer in the palm of my hand. Surely it was imagination that made it seem to throb in time with my heart. Where on earth had he gotten it?

Then I movedâ€”not suddenly, but with deliberation, my body sliding slowly free of his. I rose, feeling light-headed, and crossed the room. Pushed open the window to feel the sharp touch of the autumn wind on my naked bed-warm skin, and drawing back my arm, hurled the tiny object into the night.

Then I came back to bed, saw his hair a dark mass on the pillow, and the shine of his eyes in the moonlight.

â€œI love you,â€ I whispered, and slid under the sheet beside him, putting my arms around him, hugging him close, warmer than the stoneâ€”so much warmerâ€”and his heart beat with mine.

â€œIâ€™m none so brave as I was before, ken?â€ he said very softly. â€œNot brave enough to live without ye anymore.â€

But brave enough to try.

I drew his head down to me, stroking the tumble of his hair, coarse and smooth at once, live beneath my fingers.

â€œLay your head, man,â€ I said softly. â€œItâ€™s a long time â€™til dawn.â€

IF ONLY FOR MYSELF




THE SKY WAS A FLAT, LEADEN COLOR, threatening rain, and the wind gusted through the palmettos, rattling the leaves like sabers. Down in the depths of the tidal forest, the four stones loomed beside the creek.

â€œI am the wife of the laird of Balnain,â€ Brianna whispered, next to me. â€œThe faeries have stolen me over again.â€ She was white to the lips, Amanda clutched close to her breast.

We had made our farewellsâ€”we had been saying farewell, I thought, since the day I pressed the stethoscope to Mandyâ€™s heart. But Brianna turned and flung herselfâ€”baby and allâ€”at Jamie, who pressed her so tight against his heart, I thought one of them must break.

Then she was flying at me, a cloud of cloak and loosened hair, and her face was cold against mine, her tears and mine mingling on my skin.

â€œI love you, Mama! I love you!â€ she said in desperation, then turned and, without looking back, began to walk the pattern Donner had described, quietly chanting under her breath. A circle right, between two stones, a circle left, and back through the centerâ€”and then to the left of the largest stone.

I had been expecting it; when she began to walk the pattern, I had run away from the stones, stopping at what I thought a safe distance. It wasnâ€™t. The sound of themâ€”a roar, this time, instead of a shriekâ€”thundered through me, stopping my breath and nearly my heart. Pain froze in a band round my chest and I dropped to my knees, swaying and helpless.

They were gone. I could see Jamie and Roger running to checkâ€”terrified of finding bodies, at once desolate and elated to find none. I couldnâ€™t see wellâ€”my vision swam, flickering in and outâ€”but didnâ€™t need to. I knew they were gone, from the hole in my heart.



â€œTWO DOWN,â€ Roger whispered. His voice was no more than a faint rasp, and he cleared his throat, hard. â€œJeremiah.â€ He looked down at Jem, who blinked and sniffed, and drew himself up tall at the sound of his formal name.

â€œYe ken what weâ€™re about now, aye?â€ Jemmy nodded, though he flicked a scared glance toward the towering stone where his mother and his baby sister had just vanished. He swallowed hard, and wiped the tears off his cheeks.

â€œWell, then.â€ Roger reached out a hand and rested it gently on Jemmyâ€™s head. â€œKnow this, mo macâ€”I shall love ye all my life, and never forget ye. But this is a terrible thing weâ€™re doing, and ye need not come with me. Ye can stay with your grandda and grannie Claire; it will be all right.â€

â€œWonâ€™t Iâ€”wonâ€™t I see Mama again?â€ Jemmyâ€™s eyes were huge, and he couldnâ€™t keep from looking at the stone.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ Roger said, and I could see the tears he was fighting himself, and hear them in his thickened voice. He didnâ€™t know whether he would ever see Brianna again himself, or baby Mandy. â€œProbably . . . probably not.â€

Jamie looked down at Jem, who was clinging to his hand, looking back and forth between father and grandfather, confusion, fright, and longing in his face.

â€œIf one day, a bhailach,â€ Jamie said conversationally, â€œye should meet a verra large mouse named Michaelâ€”yeâ€™ll tell him your grandsire sends his regards.â€ He opened his hand, then, letting go, and nodded toward Roger.

Jem stood staring for a moment, then dug in his feet and sprinted toward Roger, sand spurting from under his shoes. He leaped into his fatherâ€™s arms, clutching him around the neck, and with a final glance backward, Roger turned and stepped behind the stone, and the inside of my head exploded in fire.

Unimaginable time later, I came slowly back, coming down from the clouds in fragments, like hailstones. And found myself lying with my head in Jamieâ€™s lap. And heard him saying softly, to himself or to me, â€œFor your sake, I will continueâ€”though for mine alone . . . I would not.â€

ACROSS THE ABYSS




THREE NIGHTS LATER, I WOKE FROM a restless sleep in an inn in Wilmington, my throat parched as the salt bacon I had eaten in the dinner stew. Sitting up to find water, I found that I was aloneâ€”the moonlight through the window shone white on the vacant pillow beside me.

I found Jamie outside, behind the inn, his nightshirt a pale blotch in the darkness of the innyard. He was sitting on the ground with his back against a chopping block, arms wrapped about his knees.

He didnâ€™t speak as I came toward him, but turned his head, body shifting in a silent welcome. I sat down on the chopping block behind him, and he leaned his head back against my thigh, with a long, deep sigh.

â€œCouldnâ€™t sleep?â€ I touched him gently, smoothing back the hair from his face. He slept with it unbound, and it fell thick and wild about his shoulders, tangled from bed.

â€œNay, I slept,â€ he said quietly. His eyes were open, looking up at the great gold moon, three-quarters full over the aspens near the inn. â€œI had a dream.â€

â€œA nightmare?â€ He had them seldom anymore, but they did come sometimes: the bloody memories of Culloden, of futile death and slaughter; prison dreams of hunger and confinementâ€”and sometimes, very rarely, Jack Randall returned to him in sleep, with loving cruelty. Such dreams would always drive him from his bed to walk to and fro for hours, until exhaustion cleansed him of their visions. But he had not dreamed that way since Mooreâ€™s Creek Bridge.

â€œNo,â€ he said, sounding half-surprised. â€œNot at all. I dreamed of herâ€”of our lassieâ€”and the bairns.â€

My heart gave an odd little hop, the consequence of startlement and what might almost have been envy.

â€œYou dreamed about Brianna and the children? What happened?â€

He smiled, face tranquil and abstracted in the moonlight, as though he still saw some part of the dream before him.

â€œIt is all right,â€ he said. â€œThey are safe. I saw them in a townâ€”it seemed like Inverness, but it was different, somehow. They walked up the step of a houseâ€”Roger Mac was with them,â€ he added, offhand. â€œThey knocked at the door, and a wee brown-haired woman opened to them. She laughed wiâ€™ joy to see them, and brought them in, and they went down a hallway, wiâ€™ strange things like bowls hanging from the ceiling.

â€œThen they were in a room, wiâ€™ sofas and chairs, and the room had great windows all down one wall, from the floor to the ceiling, and the afternoon sun was streaming in, setting Briannaâ€™s hair to fire, and makinâ€™ wee Mandy cry when it got in her eyes.â€

â€œDid . . . did any of them call the brown-haired woman by name?â€ I asked, my heart beating in a queer, fast way.

He frowned, moonlight making a cross of light over nose and brows.

â€œAye, they did,â€ he said. â€œI canna justâ€”oh, aye; Roger Mac called her Fiona.â€

â€œDid he?â€ I said. My hands rested on his shoulder, and my mouth was a hundred times drier than it had been when I woke up. The night was chilly, but not enough to account for the temperature of my hands.

I had told Jamie any amount of things about my own time over the years of our marriage. About trains and planes and automobiles and wars and indoor plumbing. But I was nearly sure that I had never told him what the study looked like in the manse where Roger had grown up with his adoptive father.

The room with the window wall, made to accommodate the Reverendâ€™s painting hobby. The manse with its long hallway, furnished with old-fashioned light fixtures, shaped like hanging bowls. And I knew I had never told him about the Reverendâ€™s last housekeeper, a girl with dark, curly hair, called Fiona.

â€œWere they happy?â€ I asked at last, very quietly.

â€œAye. Brianna and the ladâ€”they had some shadows to their faces, but I could see they were glad nonetheless. They all sat down to eatâ€”Brianna and her lad close together, leaning on each otherâ€”and wee Jem stuffed his face wiâ€™ cakes and cream.â€ He smiled at the picture, teeth a brief gleam in the darkness.

â€œOhâ€”at the last, just before I woke . . . wee Jem was messinâ€™ about, picking things up and putting them down as he does. There was a . . . thing . . on the table. I couldna say what it was; Iâ€™ve never seen the like.â€

He held his hands about six inches apart, frowning at them. â€œIt was maybe this wide, and just a bit longerâ€”something like a box, maybe, only sort of . . . humped.â€

â€œHumped?â€ I said, puzzled as to what this could be.

â€œAye, and it had a thing on top like a wee club, only wiâ€™ a knob to each end, and the club was tied to the box wiâ€™ a sort of black cord, curled up on itself like a piggieâ€™s tail. Jem saw it, and he reached out his hand, and said, â€˜I want to talk to Grandda.â€™ And then I woke.â€

He leaned his head back farther, so as to look up into my face.

â€œWould ye ken what a thing like that might be, Sassenach? It was like nothing Iâ€™ve ever seen.â€

The autumn wind came rustling down from the hill, dry leaves hurrying in its wake, quick and light as the footsteps of a ghost, and I felt the hair rise on nape and forearms.

â€œYes, I know,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™ve told you about them, I know.â€ I didnâ€™t think, though, that I had ever described one to him, in more than general terms. I cleared my throat.

â€œItâ€™s called a telephone.â€

THE GUARDIAN




IT WAS NOVEMBER; THERE WERE NO FLOWERS. But the holly bushes gleamed dark green, and the berries had begun to ripen. I cut a small bunch, careful of the prickles, added a tender branch of spruce for fragrance, and climbed the steep trail to the tiny graveyard.

I went every week, to leave some small token on Malvaâ€™s grave, and say a prayer. She and her child had not been buried with a cairnâ€”her father hadnâ€™t wanted such a pagan customâ€”but people came and left pebbles there by way of remembrance. It gave me some small comfort to see them; there were others who remembered her.

I stopped abruptly at the head of the trail; someone was kneeling by her graveâ€”a young man. I caught the murmur of his voice, low and conversational, and would have turned about to go, save that he raised his head, and the wind caught his hair, short and tufted, like an owlâ€™s feathers. Allan Christie.

He saw me, too, and stiffened. There was nothing to do but go and speak to him, though, and so I went.

â€œMr. Christie,â€ I said, the words feeling strange in my mouth. That was what I had called his father. â€œIâ€™m sorry for your loss.â€

He stared up at me blankly; then some sort of awareness seemed to stir in his eyes. Gray eyes, rimmed with black lashes, so much like those of his father and sister. Bloodshot with weeping and lack of sleep, judging from the shocking smudges under them.

â€œAye,â€ he said. â€œMy loss. Aye.â€

I stepped around him to lay down my evergreen bouquet, and with a small spurt of alarm, saw that there was a pistol on the ground beside him, cocked and primed.

â€œWhere have you been?â€ I said as casually as possible, under the circumstances. â€œWeâ€™ve missed you.â€

He shrugged, as though it really didnâ€™t matter where heâ€™d beenâ€”perhaps it didnâ€™t. He wasnâ€™t looking at me anymore, but at the stone weâ€™d placed at the head of her grave.

â€œPlaces,â€ he said vaguely. â€œBut I had to come back.â€ He turned away a little, plainly indicating that he wanted me to leave. Instead, I pulled up my skirts and knelt gingerly beside him. I didnâ€™t think heâ€™d blow his brains out in front of me. I had no idea what to do, other than to try to make him talk to me and hope that someone else would come along.

â€œWeâ€™re glad to have you home,â€ I said, trying for an easy, conversational note.

â€œAye,â€ he said vaguely. And again, his eyes going to the headstone, â€œI had to come back.â€ His hand wandered toward the pistol, and I seized it, startling him.

â€œI know you loved your sister very much,â€ I said. â€œItâ€”it was a terrible shock to you, I know.â€ What, what did one say? There were things one might say to a person contemplating suicide, I knew, but what?

â€œYour life has value.â€ Iâ€™d said that to Tom Christie, who had only replied, â€œIf it did not, this would not matter.â€ But how should I convince his son of that?

â€œYour father loved you both,â€ I said, wondering as I said it whether he knew what his father had done. His fingers were very cold, and I wrapped both my hands round his, trying to offer him a little warmth, hoping that the human contact would help.

â€œNot as I loved her,â€ he said softly, not looking at me. â€œI loved her all her life, from the time she was born and they gave her me to hold. There was nay other, for either of us. Faither was gone to prison, and then my mitherâ€”ah, Mither.â€ His lips pulled back, as though to laugh, but there was no sound.

â€œI know about your mother,â€ I said. â€œYour father told me.â€

â€œDid he?â€ His head jerked up to look at me, eyes clear and hard. â€œDid he tell ye they took me and Malva to her execution?â€

â€œIâ€”no. I donâ€™t think he knew, did he?â€ My stomach clenched.

â€œHe did. I told him, later, when he sent for us, brought us here. He said that was good, weâ€™d seen with our own eyes the ends of wickedness. He bade me remember the lessonâ€”and so I did,â€ he added more quietly.

â€œHowâ€”how old were you?â€ I asked, horrified.

â€œTen. Malva was nay more than two; sheâ€™d no idea what was happening. She cried out for her Mam when they brought Mither out to the hangsman, and kicked and screamed, reaching out for her.â€

He swallowed, and turned his head away.

â€œI tried to take her, to push her head into my bosom, so she shouldna seeâ€”but they wouldna let me have her. They held her wee head and made her watch, and Auntie Darla saying in her ear that this was what happened to witches, and pinching her legs â€™til she shrieked. We lived with Auntie Darla for six years after that,â€ he said, his face remote.

â€œShe wasna best pleased about it, but she said she kent her Christian duty. The auld besom barely fed us, and â€™twas me took care of Malva.â€

He was silent for a bit, and so was I, thinking the bestâ€”the onlyâ€”thing I could offer him now was the chance to speak. He pulled his hand from mine, leaned over, and touched the gravestone. It was no more than a lump of granite, but someone had gone to the trouble to carve her name on itâ€”only the one word, MALVA , in crude block letters. It reminded me of the memorials that dotted Culloden, the clanstones, each with a single name.

â€œShe was perfect,â€ he whispered. His finger traced its way over the stone, delicate, as though he touched her flesh. â€œSo perfect. Her wee privates looked like a flowerâ€™s bud, and her skin sae fresh and soft. . . .â€

A sense of coldness grew in the pit of my stomach. Did he mean . . . yes, of course he did. A sense of inevitable despair began to grow within me.

â€œShe was mine,â€ he said, and looking up to see my eye upon him, repeated it more loudly. â€œShe was mine!â€

He looked down, then, at the grave, and his mouth turned in upon itself, in grief and anger.

â€œThe auld man never knewâ€”never guessed what we were to each other.â€

Didnâ€™t he? I thought. Tom Christie might have confessed to the crime to save one he lovedâ€”but he loved more than one. Having lost a daughterâ€”or rather, a nieceâ€”would he not do all he could to save the son who was the last remnant of his blood?

â€œYou killed her,â€ I said quietly. I was in no doubt, and he showed no surprise.

â€œHe would haâ€™ sold her away, given her to some clod of a farmer.â€ Allanâ€™s fist clenched on his thigh. â€œI thought of that, as she grew older, and sometimes when I would lie with her, I couldna bear the thought, and would slap her face, only from the rage of thinking of it.â€

He drew a deep, ragged breath.

â€œIt wasna her fault, none of it. But I thought it was. And then I caught her wiâ€™ that soldier, and again, wiâ€™ filthy wee Henderson. I beat her for it, but she cried out that she couldna help itâ€”she was with child.â€

â€œYours?â€

He nodded, slowly.

â€œI never thought of it. I should, of course. But I never did. She was always wee Malva, see, a bittie wee lass. I saw her breasts swell, aye, and the hair come out to mar her sweet fleshâ€”but I just never thought . . .

He shook his head, unable to deal with the thought, even now.

â€œShe said she must marryâ€”and there must be reason for her husband to think the child his, whoever she wed. If she couldna make the soldier wed her, then it must be another. So she took as many lovers as she might, quickly.

â€œI put a stop to that, though,â€ he assured me, a faintly nauseating tone of self-righteousness in his voice. â€œI told her I wouldna have itâ€”I would think of another way.â€

â€œAnd so you put her up to saying the child was Jamieâ€™s.â€ My horror at the story and my anger at what he had done to us was subsumed by a flood of sorrow. Oh, Malva, I thought in despair. Oh, my darling Malva. Why didnâ€™t you tell me? But of course she wouldnâ€™t have told me. Her only confidant was Allan.

He nodded, and reached out to touch the stone again. A gust of wind quivered through the holly, stirring the stiff leaves.

â€œIt would explain the bairn, see, but she wouldna have to wed anyone. I thoughtâ€”Himself would give her money to go away, and I would go with her. We could go to Canada, perhaps, or to the Indies.â€ His voice sounded dreamy, as though he envisioned some idyllic life, where no one knew.

â€œBut why did you kill her?â€ I burst out. â€œWhat made you do that?â€ The sorrow and the senselessness were overwhelming; I clenched my hands in my apron, not to batter him.

â€œI had to,â€ he said heavily. â€œShe said she couldna go through with it.â€ He blinked, looking down, and I saw that his eyes were heavy with tears.

â€œShe saidâ€”she loved you,â€ he said, low-voiced and thick. â€œShe couldna hurt ye so. She meant to tell the truth. No matter what I said to her, she just kept saying thatâ€”she loved ye, and sheâ€™d tell.â€

He closed his eyes, shoulders slumping. Two tears ran down his cheeks.

â€œWhy, hinny?â€ he cried, crossing his arms over his belly in a spasm of grief. â€œWhy did ye make me do it? Ye shouldna have loved anyone but me.â€

He sobbed then, like a child, and curled into himself, weeping. I was weeping, too, for the loss and the pointlessness, for the utter, terrible waste of it all. But I reached out and took the gun from the ground. Hands shaking, I dumped out the priming pan, and shook the ball from the barrel, then put the pistol in the pocket of my apron.

â€œLeave,â€ I said, my voice half-choked. â€œGo away again, Allan. There are too many people dead.â€

He was too grief-stricken to hear me; I shook him by the shoulder and said it again, more strongly.

â€œYou canâ€™t kill yourself. I forbid it, do you hear?â€

â€œAnd who are you to say?â€ he cried, turning on me. His face was contorted with anguish. â€œI cannot live, I cannot!â€

But Tom Christie had given up his life for his son, as well as for me; I couldnâ€™t let that sacrifice go for naught.

â€œYou must,â€ I said, and stood up, feeling light-headed, unsure whether my knees would hold me. â€œDo you hear me? You must!â€

He looked up, eyes burning through the tears, but didnâ€™t speak. There was a keening whine like the hum of a mosquito, and a soft, sudden thump. He didnâ€™t change expression, but his eyes slowly died. He stayed on his knees for a moment, but bowed then forward, like a flower nodding on its stem, so I saw the arrow protruding from the center of his back. He coughed, once, sputtering blood, and fell sideways, curled on his sisterâ€™s grave. His legs jerked spasmodically, grotesquely froglike. Then he lay still.

I stood stupidly staring at him for some immeasurable span of time, becoming only gradually aware that Ian had walked out of the wood and stood beside me, bow over his shoulder. Rollo nosed curiously at the body, whining.

â€œHeâ€™s right, Auntie,â€ Ian said quietly. â€œHe canâ€™t.â€

RETURN OF THE NATIVE




OLD GRANNIE ABERNATHY looked at least a hundred and two. She admittedâ€”under pressureâ€”to ninety-one. She was nearly blind and nearly deaf, curled up like a pretzel from osteoporosis, and with skin gone so fragile that the merest scrape tore it like paper.

â€œIâ€™m nay more than a bag oâ€™ bones,â€ she said every time I saw her, shaking a head that trembled with palsy. â€œBut at least Iâ€™ve still got maist oâ€™ my teeth!â€

For a wonder, she had; I thought that was the only reason she had made it this farâ€”unlike many people half her age, she wasnâ€™t reduced to living on porridge, but could still stomach meat and greens. Perhaps it was improved nutrition that kept her goingâ€”perhaps it was mere stubbornness. Her married name was Abernathy, but she had, she confided, been born a Fraser.

Smiling at the thought, I finished wrapping the bandage about her sticklike shin. Her legs and feet had almost no flesh upon them, and felt hard and cold as wood. Sheâ€™d knocked her shin against the leg of the table and taken off a strip of skin the width of a finger; such a minor injury that a younger person would think nothing of itâ€”but her family worried over her, and had sent for me.

â€œIt will be slow healing, but if you keep it cleanâ€”for Godâ€™s sake, do not let her put hog fat on it!â€”I think it will be all right.â€ The younger Mrs. Abernathy, known as Young Grannieâ€”herself about seventyâ€”gave me a sharp eye at that; like her mother-in-law, she put a good deal of faith in hog fat and turpentine as cure-alls, but nodded grudgingly. Her daughter, whose high-flown name of Arabella had been shortened to the cozier Grannie Belly, grinned at me behind Young Grannieâ€™s back. She had been less fortunate in the way of teethâ€”her smile showed significant gapsâ€”but was cheerful and good-natured.

â€œWillie B.,â€ she instructed a teenaged grandson, â€œjust be steppinâ€™ doon to the root cellar, and bringing up a wee sack of turnips for Herself.â€

I made the usual protestations, but all parties concerned were comfortably aware of the proper protocol in such matters, and within a few minutes, I was on my way home, the richer by five pounds of turnips.

They were welcome. I had forced myself to go back to my garden in the spring after Malvaâ€™s deathâ€”I had to; sentiment was all very well, but we had to eat. The subsequent disturbances of life and my prolonged absences, though, had resulted in dreadful neglect of the autumn crop. Despite Mrs. Bugâ€™s best efforts, the turnips had all succumbed to thrips and black rot.

Our supplies in general were sadly depleted. With Jamie and Ian gone so frequently, not there to harvest or hunt, and without Bree and Roger, the grain crops had been half of their usual yield, and only a pitiful single haunch of venison hung in the smoking shed. We needed nearly all the grain for our own use; there was none to trade or sell, and only a scant few bags of barleycorn sat under canvas near the malting shedâ€”where they were likely to rot, I thought grimly, as no one had had time to see to the malting of a fresh batch before the cold weather set in.

Mrs. Bug was slowly rebuilding her flock of chickens, after a disastrous attack by a fox that got into the henhouseâ€”but it was slow going, and we got only the occasional egg for breakfast, grudgingly spared.

On the other hand, I reflected more cheerfully, we did have ham. Lots of ham. Likewise, immense quantities of bacon, headcheese, pork chops, tenderloin . . . to say nothing of suet and rendered fat.

The thought led me back to hog fat, and to the crowded, overflowingly familiar coziness of the Abernathysâ€™ cluster of cabinsâ€”and by contrast, to thought of the dreadful emptiness at the Big House.

In a place with so many people, how could the loss of only four be so important? I had to stop and lean against a tree, let the sorrow wash through me, making no attempt to stop it. Iâ€™d learned. â€œYe canna hold a ghost at bay,â€ Jamie had told me. â€œLet them in.â€

I let them inâ€”I could never keep them out. And took what small comfort I could in hopingâ€”no, I didnâ€™t hope, I told myself fiercely, I knewâ€”that they were not ghosts in fact. Not dead, but only . . . elsewhere.

After a few moments, the overwhelming grief began to recede, going slowly as the ebbing tide. Sometimes it uncovered treasure: small forgotten images of Jemmyâ€™s face, smeared with honey, Briannaâ€™s laughter, Rogerâ€™s hands, deft with a knife, carving one of the little carsâ€”the house was still littered with themâ€”then leaning to spear a muffin from a passing plate. And if to look at these caused fresh pain, at least I had them, and could keep them in my heart, knowing that in the fullness of time, they would bring consolation.

I breathed, and felt the tightness in my chest and throat ease. Amanda was not the only one who might benefit from modern surgery, I thought. I couldnâ€™t tell what might be done for Rogerâ€™s vocal cords, but maybe . . . and yet, his voice now was good. Full and resonant, if rough. Perhaps he would choose to keep it as it wasâ€”heâ€™d fought for it, and earned it.

The tree I leaned against was a pine; the needles swayed softly above me, then settled, as though in agreement. I had to go; it was late in the day and the air was growing colder.

Wiping my eyes, I settled the hood of my cloak and went on. It was a long walk from the Abernathysâ€™â€”I should really have ridden Clarence, but heâ€™d come up lame the day before, and Iâ€™d let him rest. Iâ€™d have to hurry, though, if I was to reach home before dark.

I cast a wary eye upward, judging the clouds, which had that soft, uniform gray of coming snow. The air was cold and thick with moisture; when the temperature dropped at nightfall, snow would fall.

The sky was still light, but only just, as I came down past the springhouse and into the backyard. Light enough to tell me that something was wrong, thoughâ€”the back door stood open.

That set off alarm bells, and I turned to run back into the woods. I turned, and ran smack into a man who had come out of the trees behind me.

â€œWho the hell are you?â€ I demanded, stepping hastily back.

â€œDonâ€™t worry about that, Mrs.,â€ he said, and grabbing me by the arm, yelled toward the house, â€œHey, Donner! I got her!â€



WHATEVER WENDIGO DONNER been doing for the last year, it hadnâ€™t been profitable, by the looks of him. Never a natty dresser at the best of times, he was now so ragged that his coat was literally falling apart, and a slice of stringy buttock showed through a rent in his breeches. His mane of hair was greasy and matted, and he stank.

â€œWhere are they?â€ he demanded hoarsely.

â€œWhere are what?â€ I swung round to face his companion, who seemed in slightly better condition. â€œAnd where are my housemaid and her sons?â€ We were standing in the kitchen, and the hearth fire was out; Mrs. Bug hadnâ€™t come that morning, and wherever Amy and the boys were, theyâ€™d been gone for some time.

â€œDunno.â€ The man shrugged, indifferent. â€œWasnâ€™t nobody to home when we came.â€

â€œWhere are the jewels?â€ Donner grabbed at my arm, jerking me round to face him. His eyes were sunk in his head, and his grip was hot; he was burning with fever.

â€œI havenâ€™t got any,â€ I said shortly. â€œYouâ€™re ill. You shouldâ€”â€

â€œYou do! I know you do! Everybody knows!â€

That gave me momentary pause. Gossip being what it was, everybody likely thought they knew that Jamie had a small cache of jewels. Small wonder if word of this hypothetical treasure had reached Donnerâ€”and little likelihood that I could convince him otherwise. I had no choice but to try, though.

â€œTheyâ€™re gone,â€ I said simply.

Something flickered in his eyes at that.

â€œHow?â€ he said.

I raised an eyebrow in the direction of his accomplice. Did he want the man to know?

â€œGo find Richie and Jed,â€ Donner said briefly to the thug, who shrugged and went out. Richie and Jed? How on earth many people had he brought? Past the first shock of seeing him, I now became aware that there were thumping feet upstairs, and the sound of cupboard doors being banged impatiently down the hall.

â€œMy surgery! Get them out of there!â€ I dove for the door to the hallway, intending to perform this office myself, but Donner grabbed at my cloak to stop me.

I was bloody tired of being manhandled, and I wasnâ€™t afraid of this miserable excuse for a human being.

â€œLet go!â€ I snapped, and kicked him briskly in the kneecap to emphasize the point. He yelped, but let go; I could hear him cursing behind me as I rushed through the door and down the hall.

Papers and books had been flung out into the hallway from Jamieâ€™s office, and a puddle of ink had been poured over them. The explanation of the ink was apparent when I saw the thug rifling my surgeryâ€”he had a big blot of ink on the front of his shirt, where he had apparently sequestered the stolen pewter inkwell.

â€œWhat are you doing, you nitwit?â€ I said. The thug, a boy of sixteen or so, blinked at me, mouth open. He had one of Mr. Blogweatherâ€™s perfect glass globes in his hand; at this, he grinned maliciously and let it drop to the floor, where it shattered into a spray of fragments. One of the flying shards lanced through his cheek, slicing it open; he didnâ€™t feel it, until the blood began to well. Then he put a hand to the wound, frowning in puzzlement, and bellowed in fright at the blood on his hand.

â€œCrap,â€ said Donner, behind me. He put his arms around me, and dragged me after him back to the kitchen.

â€œLook,â€ he said urgently, releasing me. â€œAll I want is two. You can keep the rest. I gotta have one to pay these guys, and one toâ€”to travel with.â€

â€œBut itâ€™s true,â€ I insisted, knowing that he wouldnâ€™t believe me. â€œWe havenâ€™t got any. My daughter and her familyâ€”theyâ€™ve gone. Gone back. They used all we had. There arenâ€™t any more.â€

He stared at me, disbelief plain in his burning eyes.

â€œYes, there are,â€ he said positively. â€œThere have to be. I gotta get out of here!â€

â€œWhy?â€

â€œNever you mind. I gotta go, and quick.â€ He swallowed, eyes darting around the kitchen, as though the gems might be sitting casually on the sideboard. â€œWhere are they?â€

A hideous crash from the surgery, followed by an outbreak of shouted curses, prevented any reply I might have made. I moved by reflex toward the door, but Donner moved in front of me.

I was infuriated at this invasion, and beginning to be alarmed. While Iâ€™d never seen any indication of violence from Donner, I wasnâ€™t so sure about the men heâ€™d brought with him. They might eventually give up and leave, when it became apparent that there were in fact no gems on the premisesâ€”or they might try to beat the location of said gems out of me.

I pulled my cloak more tightly around myself and sat down on a bench, trying to think calmly.

â€œLook,â€ I said to Donner. â€œYouâ€™ve taken the house apartâ€”â€ A crash from upstairs shook the house, and I jumped. My God, it sounded as though theyâ€™d tipped over the wardrobe. â€œYouâ€™ve taken the house apart,â€ I repeated, through gritted teeth, â€œand you havenâ€™t found anything. Wouldnâ€™t I give them to you, if I had any, to save you wrecking the place?â€

â€œNo, I donâ€™t reckon you would. I wouldnâ€™t, if I was you.â€ He rubbed a hand across his mouth. â€œYou know whatâ€™s going onâ€”the war and all.â€ He shook his head in confusion. â€œI didnâ€™t know it would be this way. Swear to God, half the people I meet donâ€™t know which way is up anymore. I thought itâ€™d be like, you know, redcoats and all, and you just keep away from anybody in a uniform, keep away from the battles, and itâ€™d be fine. But I havenâ€™t seen a redcoat anywhere, and peopleâ€”you know, just plain old peopleâ€”theyâ€™re shooting each other and running around burning up each otherâ€™s houses. . . .â€

He closed his eyes for a minute. His cheeks went from red one moment to white the next; I could see he was very ill. I could hear him, too; the breath rattled wetly in his chest, and he wheezed faintly. If he fainted, how would I get rid of his companions?

â€œAnyway,â€ he said, opening his eyes. â€œIâ€™m going. Going back. I donâ€™t care what things are like then; itâ€™s a hell of a lot betterâ€™n here.â€

â€œWhat about the Indians?â€ I inquired, with no more than a touch of sarcasm. â€œLeaving them to their own devices, are you?â€

â€œYeah,â€ he said, missing the sarcasm. â€œTell you the truth, Iâ€™m not so keen on Indians anymore, either.â€ He rubbed absently at his upper chest, and I saw a large, puckered scar through a rent in his shirt.

â€œMan,â€ he said, longing clear in his voice, â€œwhat I wouldnâ€™t give for a cold Bud and a baseball game on TV.â€ Then his wandering attention snapped back to me. â€œSo,â€ he said in a halfway reasonable tone, â€œI need those diamonds. Or whatever. Hand â€™em over and weâ€™ll leave.â€

I had been turning over various schemes for getting rid of them, to no particular avail, and was getting more uneasy by the moment. We had very little worth stealing, and from the looks of the rifled sideboard, theyâ€™d already got what there wasâ€”including, I realized, with a fresh stab of alarm, the pistols and powder. Before too much longer, theyâ€™d grow impatient.

Someone might comeâ€”Amy and the boys were likely at Briannaâ€™s cabin, which they were in process of moving into; they could come back at any moment. Someone could come looking for Jamie or myselfâ€”though the chances of that receded by the moment, with the dying light. Even if someone did, though, the effect was likely to be disastrous.

Then I heard voices on the front porch, and the stamping of feet, and leapt to my own feet, my heart in my mouth.

â€œWould you quit doinâ€™ that?â€ Donner said irritably. â€œYouâ€™re the jumpiest twat I ever saw.â€

I ignored him, having recognized one of the voices. Sure enough, in the next moment, two of the thugs, brandishing pistols, shoved Jamie into the kitchen.

He was wary and disheveled, but his eyes went immediately to me, running up and down my body to assure himself that I was all right.

â€œIâ€™m fine,â€ I said briefly. â€œThese idiots think we have gemstones, and they want them.â€

â€œSo they said.â€ He straightened himself, shrugging to settle the coat on his shoulders, and glanced at the cupboards, hanging open, and the despoiled sideboard. Even the pie hutch had been overturned, and the remains of a raisin pie lay squashed on the floor, marked with a large heelprint. â€œI gather theyâ€™ve looked.â€

â€œLook, mate,â€ said one of the thugs, reasonably, â€œall we wantâ€™s the swag. Just tell us where it is, and we go, no â€™arm done, eh?â€

Jamie rubbed the bridge of his nose, eyeing the man whoâ€™d spoken.

â€œI imagine my wife has told ye that we have no gems?â€

â€œWell, she would, wouldnâ€™t she?â€ the thug said tolerantly. â€œWomen, you know.â€ He seemed to feel that now Jamie had showed up, they could get on with things in a more businesslike fashion, man-to-man.

Jamie sighed and sat down.

â€œWhy dâ€™ye think Iâ€™ve got any?â€ he inquired, rather mildly. â€œI have had, I admitâ€”but no longer. Theyâ€™ve been sold.â€

â€œWhereâ€™s the money, then?â€ The second thug was obviously quite willing to settle for that, no matter what Donner thought.

â€œSpent,â€ Jamie said briefly. â€œIâ€™m a colonel of militiaâ€”surely ye ken that much? Itâ€™s an expensive business, provisioning a militia company. Food, guns, powder, shoesâ€”it adds up, aye? Why, the cost in shoe leather aloneâ€”and then, to say nothing of shoon for the horses! Wagons, too; ye wouldna believe the scandalous cost of wagons. . . .â€

One of the thugs was frowning, but half-nodding, following this reasonable exegesis. Donner and his other companion were noticeably agitated, though.

â€œShut up about the damn wagons,â€ Donner said rudely, and bending, he snatched up one of Mrs. Bugâ€™s butcher knives from the floor. â€œNow, look,â€ he said, scowling and trying to look menacing. â€œIâ€™ve had it with the stalling around. You tell me where they are, orâ€”or Iâ€™llâ€”Iâ€™ll cut her! Yeah, Iâ€™ll cut her throat. Swear I will.â€ With this, he clutched me by the shoulder and put the knife to my throat.

It had become clear to me some little time ago that Jamie was stalling for time, which meant that he expected something to happen. Which in turn meant he was expecting someone to come. That was reassuring, but I did think the apparent nonchalance of his demeanor in the face of my theoretically impending demise was perhaps carrying things a trifle too far.

â€œOh,â€ he said, scratching at the side of his neck. â€œWell, I wouldna do that, if I were you. Sheâ€™s the one who kens where the gems are, aye?â€

â€œI what?â€ I cried indignantly.

â€œShe is?â€ One of the other thugs brightened at that.

â€œOh, aye,â€ Jamie assured him. â€œLast time I went out wiâ€™ the militia, she hid them. Wouldna tell me where sheâ€™d put them.â€

â€œWaitâ€”I thought you said you sold â€™em and spent the money,â€ Donner said, plainly confused.

â€œI was lying,â€ Jamie explained, patient.

â€œOh.â€

â€œBut if yeâ€™re going to kill my wife, well, then, of course that alters the case.â€

â€œOh,â€ said Donner, looking somewhat happier. â€œYeah. Exactly!â€

â€œI believe we havena been introduced, sir,â€ Jamie said politely, extending a hand. â€œI am James Fraser. And you are . . . ?â€

Donner hesitated for a minute, unsure what to do with the knife in his right hand, but then shifted it awkwardly to his left and leaned forward to shake Jamieâ€™s hand briefly.

â€œWendigo Donner,â€ he said. â€œOkay, now weâ€™re getting somewhere.â€

I made a rude noise, but it was drowned by a series of crashes and the sound of breaking glass from the surgery. The lout in there must be clearing the shelves wholesale, flinging bottles and jars on the floor. I grasped Donnerâ€™s hand and pulled the knife away from my throat, then sprang to my feet, in much the same state of insane fury in which I had once torched a field full of grasshoppers.

This time, it was Jamie who seized me around the middle as I darted toward the door, swinging me half off my feet.

â€œLet go! Iâ€™ll frigging kill him!â€ I said, kicking madly.

â€œWell, wait just a bit about that, Sassenach,â€ he said, low-voiced, and lugged me back to the table, where he sat down with his arms wrapped around me, holding me firmly pinned on his lap. Further sounds of depredation came down the hallâ€”the splintering of wood and crunch of glass under a bootheel. Evidently, the young lout had given up searching for anything and was simply destroying for the fun of it.

I took a deep breath, preparatory to emitting a scream of frustration, but stopped.

â€œJeez,â€ Donner said, wrinkling his nose. â€œWhatâ€™s that smell? Somebody cut one?â€ He looked accusingly at me, but I paid no attention. It was ether, heavy and sickly sweet.

Jamie stiffened slightly. He knew what it was, too, and essentially what it did.

Then he took a deep breath and carefully moved me off his lap, setting me on the bench beside him. I saw his eyes go to the knife sagging in Donnerâ€™s hand, and heard what his keener ears had already picked up. Someone was coming.

He moved a little forward, getting his feet under him to spring, and flicked his eyes toward the cold hearth, where a heavy Dutch oven was sitting in the ashes. I nodded, very briefly, and as the back door opened, made a lunge across the kitchen.

Donner, with unexpected swiftness, stuck out a leg and tripped me. I fell headlong and slid, fetching up against the settle with a head-ringing thump. I groaned and lay still for a few moments, eyes closed, feeling all at once that I was much too old for this sort of carry-on. I opened my eyes reluctantly, and very stiffly got to my feet, to find the kitchen now full of people.

Donnerâ€™s original sidekick had returned with two others, presumably Richie and Jed, and with them, the Bugs, Murdina looking alarmed, and Arch, coldly furious.

â€œA leannan!â€ Mrs. Bug cried, rushing toward me. â€œAre ye hurt, then?â€

â€œNo, no,â€ I said, still rather dazed. â€œJust let me . . . sit down for a moment.â€ I looked at Donner, but he no longer held his knife. He had been frowning at the floorâ€”evidently he had dropped it when he tripped meâ€”but his head jerked up at sight of the newcomers.

â€œWhat? Did you find anything?â€ he asked eagerly, for both Richie and Jed were beaming with self-importance.

â€œSure did,â€ one of them assured him. â€œLooka here!â€ He was holding Mrs. Bugâ€™s workbag, and at this, he upended it and shook the contents out onto the table, where a mass of woolly knitting landed with a massive thunk! Eager hands pawed the wool away, revealing an eight-inch-long ingot of gold, the metal shaved away at one end, and stamped in the center with the royal French fleur-de-lis.

Stunned silence followed the appearance of this apparition. Even Jamie looked completely nonplussed.

Mrs. Bug had been pale when they came in; now she had gone the color of chalk, and her lips had disappeared. Archâ€™s eyes went straight to Jamieâ€™s, dark and defiant.

The only person unimpressed by sight of the glowing metal was Donner.

â€œWell, neato-mosquito,â€ he said. â€œWhat about the jewels? Keep your eye on the goal here, people!â€

His accomplices, however, had lost interest in theoretical jewels, with solid gold actually in hand, and were simultaneously discussing the possibility of more and squabbling over who should have custody of the present ingot.

My own head was spinning: from the blow, from the sudden appearance of the ingot and its revelations regarding the Bugsâ€”and particularly from the fumes of ether, which were getting notably stronger. No one in the kitchen had noticed, but all sound from the surgery had ceased; the young lout in there had undoubtedly passed out.

The bottle of ether had been nearly full; enough to anesthetize a dozen elephants, I thought dizzilyâ€”or a houseful of people. Already, I could see Donner struggling to keep his head upright. A few minutes more, and all the thugs would likely have subsided into a state of innocuous desuetudeâ€”but so would we.

Ether is heavier than air; the stuff would sink to the floor, where it would gradually rise in a pool around our knees. I stood up, taking a quick breath from the presumably purer air higher up. I had to get the window open.

Jamie and Arch were speaking Gaelic to each other, much too fast for me to follow, even had my head been in normal working order. Donner was frowning at them, mouth open as though he meant to tell them to stop but couldnâ€™t quite find the words.

I fumbled with the catch of the inside shutters, having to concentrate very hard in order to make my fingers work. Finally, the latch flipped free and I swung the shutter openâ€”revealing the leering face of an unfamiliar Indian in the twilight outside the window.

I shrieked and staggered back. Next thing, the back door sprang open and a squat bearded figure rushed in, bellowing in some incomprehensible tongue, followed by Ian, who was followed by yet another strange Indian, screaming and laying about himself with somethingâ€”tomahawk? club? I couldnâ€™t get my eyes to focus well enough to tell.

All was pandemonium, seen through glazed eyes. I clutched the windowsill to keep from sinking to the floor, but couldnâ€™t summon the presence of mind to open the damn window. Everyone was struggling and fighting, but the inhabitants of the kitchen were doing it in slow motion, yelling and staggering like drunks. As I watched, my mouth hanging unbecomingly open, Jamie painstakingly drew Donnerâ€™s knife out from under his buttocks, brought it up in a slow, graceful arc, and buried it under Donnerâ€™s breastbone.

Something flew past my ear and crashed through the window, destroying what was probably the only intact pane of glass left in the house.

I breathed in deep gulps of fresh air, trying to clear my head, and made frantic waving motions with my hands, shoutingâ€”or trying to shoutâ€”â€œGet out! Get out!â€

Mrs. Bug was trying to do just that, crawling on hands and knees toward the half-open door. Arch hit the wall and slid slowly down beside her, face gone blank. Donner had fallen face forward over the table, his blood dripping nastily onto the floorboards, and another thug was lying in the extinct hearth, his skull crushed. Jamie was still upright, swaying, and the squat bearded figure was standing beside him, shaking his head and looking confused as the fumes began to affect him.

â€œWhatâ€™s going on?â€ I heard him ask.

The kitchen was nearly dark now, the figures swaying like fronds of kelp in some underwater forest.

I closed my eyes for a second. When I opened them again, Ian was saying, â€œWait, Iâ€™ll light a candle.â€ He had one of Briannaâ€™s matches in his hand, the tin in the other.

â€œIAN!â€ I shrieked, and then he struck the match.

There was a soft whoof! noise, then a louder whoomp! as the ether in the surgery ignited, and suddenly we were standing in a pool of fire. For a fraction of a second, I felt nothing, and then a burst of searing heat. Jamie seized my arm and hurled me toward the door; I staggered out, fell into the blackberry bushes, and rolled through them, thrashing and flailing at my smoking skirts.

Panicked and still uncoordinated from the ether, I struggled with the strings of my apron, finally managing to rip loose the strings and wriggle out of it. My linen petticoats were singed, but not charred. I crouched panting in the dead weeds of the dooryard, unable to do anything for the moment but breathe. The smell of smoke was strong and pungent.

Mrs. Bug was on the back porch on her knees, jerking off her cap, which was on fire.

Men erupted through the back door, beating at their clothes and hair. Rollo was in the yard, barking hysterically, and on the other side of the house, I could hear the screams of frightened horses. Someone had got Arch Bug outâ€”he was stretched at full length in the dead grass, most of his hair and eyebrows gone, but evidently still alive.

My legs were red and blistered, but I wasnâ€™t badly burnedâ€”thank God for layers of linen and cotton, which burn slowly, I thought groggily. Had I been wearing something modern like rayon, I should have gone up like a torch.

The thought made me look back toward the house. It was full dark by now, and all the windows on the lower floor were alight. Flame danced in the open door. The place looked like an immense jack-oâ€™-lantern.

â€œYeâ€™re Mistress Fraser, I suppose?â€ The squat, bearded person bent over me, speaking in a soft Scottish burr.

â€œYes,â€ I said, coming gradually to myself. â€œWho are you, and whereâ€™s Jamie?â€

â€œHere, Sassenach.â€ Jamie stumbled out of the dark and sat down heavily beside me. He waved a hand at the Scotsman. â€œMay I present Mr. Alexander Cameron, known more generally as Scotchee?â€

â€œYour servant, maâ€™am,â€ he said politely.

I was feeling gingerly at my hair. Clumps of it had been singed to crispy thread, but at least I still had some.

I felt, rather than saw, Jamie look up at the house. I followed the direction of his glance, and saw a dark figure at the window upstairs, framed in the dim glow from the burning downstairs. He shouted something in the incomprehensible tongue, and began throwing things out of the window.

â€œWhoâ€™s that?â€ I asked, feeling more than slightly surreal.

â€œOh.â€ Jamie rubbed at his face. â€œThat would be Goose.â€

â€œOf course it would,â€ I said, nodding. â€œHeâ€™ll be a cooked goose, if he stays in there.â€ This struck me as wildly hilarious, and I doubled up in laughter.

Evidently, it wasnâ€™t quite as witty as Iâ€™d thought; no one else seemed to think it funny. Jamie stood up and shouted something at the dark figure, who waved nonchalantly and turned back into the room.

â€œThereâ€™s a ladder in the barn,â€ Jamie said calmly to Scotchee, and they moved off into the darkness.

The house burned fairly slowly for a while; there werenâ€™t a lot of easily flammable objects down below, bar the books and papers in Jamieâ€™s study. A tall figure belted out of the back door, shirt pulled up over his nose with one hand, the tail of his shirt held up with the other to form a bag.

Ian came to a stop beside me, dropped to his knees, gasping, and let down his shirttail, releasing a pile of small objects.

â€œThatâ€™s all I could get, Iâ€™m afraid, Auntie.â€ He coughed a few times, waving his hand in front of his face. â€œDâ€™ye ken what happened?â€

â€œItâ€™s not important,â€ I said. The heat was becoming more intense, and I struggled to my knees. â€œCome on; weâ€™ll need to get Arch further away.â€

The effects of the ether had mostly worn off, but I was still conscious of a strong sense of unreality. I hadnâ€™t anything but cold well water with which to treat burns, but bathed Archâ€™s neck and hands, which had been badly blistered. Mrs. Bugâ€™s hair had been singed, but she, like me, had been largely protected by her heavy skirts.

Neither she nor Arch said a word.

Amy McCallum came running up, face pale in the fiery glow; I told her to take the Bugs to Briannaâ€™s cabinâ€”hers nowâ€”and for Godâ€™s sake, keep the little boys safe away. She nodded and went, she and Mrs. Bug supporting Archâ€™s tall form between them.

No one made any effort to bring out the bodies of Donner and his companions.

I could see when the fire took hold in the stairwell; there was a sudden strong glow in the upstairs windows, and shortly thereafter, I could see flames in the heart of the house.

Snow began to fall, in thick, heavy, silent flakes. Within half an hour, the ground, trees, and bushes were dusted with white. The flames glowed red and gold, and the white snow reflected a soft reddish glow; the whole clearing seemed filled with the light of the fire.

Somewhere around midnight, the roof fell in, with a crash of glowing timbers and a tremendous shower of sparks that fountained high into the night. The sight was so beautiful that everyone watching went â€œOooooh!â€ in involuntary awe.

Jamieâ€™s arm tightened round me. We could not look away.

â€œWhatâ€™s the date today?â€ I asked suddenly.

He frowned for a moment, thinking, then said, â€œDecember twenty-first.â€

â€œAnd we arenâ€™t dead, either. Bloody newspapers,â€ I said. â€œThey never get anything right.â€

For some reason, he thought that was very funny indeed, and laughed until he had to sit down on the ground.

PROPERTY OF THE KING




WE SPENT THE REMAINDER OF the night sleepingâ€”or at least horizontalâ€”on the floor of the cabin, with the Bugs, Goose and his brother, Lightâ€”who confused me initially by referring to themselves as Jamieâ€™s â€œsonsâ€â€”Scotchee, and Ian. On their way to visit Birdâ€™s village, the Indiansâ€”for Alexander Cameron was as much an Indian as the others, I thoughtâ€”had met Jamie and Ian, hunting, and accepted Jamieâ€™s hospitality.

â€œThough it was a warmer welcome than we expected, Bear-Killer!â€ Goose said, laughing.

They did not ask who Donner was, nor make any reference to the men whose bodies burned in the funeral pyre of the houseâ€”only asked awed questions about the ether, and shook their heads in amazement, watching the fire.

For Jamieâ€™s part, I noticed that he did not ask why they were going to Birdâ€™s villageâ€”and concluded that he did not want to hear that some of the Cherokee had decided to support the King. He listened to the talk, but said little, spending his time fingering through the pile of objects saved from the fire. There was little of value thereâ€”a few scorched, loose pages from my casebook, some pewter spoons, a bullet mold. But when he fell asleep at last next to me, I saw that his fist was closed around something, and peering closely in the dark, made out the protruding head of the little cherrywood snake.

I woke just past dawn to find Aidan peering down at me, Adso in his arms.

â€œI found your wee cheetie in my bed,â€ Aidan whispered. â€œDâ€™ye want him?â€

I was about to refuse, but then saw the look in Adsoâ€™s eye. He was very tolerant of small children normally, but Aidan was holding him round the middle like a bag of laundry, his back legs dangling ludicrously.

â€œYes,â€ I said, my voice hoarse from smoke. â€œHereâ€”Iâ€™ll take him.â€

I sat up, but having accepted the cat, saw that most of the household was still asleep, rolled in blankets on the floor. Two notable exceptions: Jamie and Arch Bug were missing. I got up, and borrowing Amyâ€™s cloak from beside the door, went out.

The snow had stopped during the night, but there were two or three inches on the ground. I put Adso down under the eaves, where the ground was clear, and thenâ€”with a deep breath to steady myselfâ€”turned to look at the house.

Steam rose from the charred remains, which stood inkblot black and stark against the white-furred trees behind it. Only about half the house had burned completely; the west wall was still standing, as were the stone chimney stacks. The rest was a mass of charred timbers and mounded ash, already turning gray. The upper story was completely gone, and as for my surgery . . .

I turned away, hearing voices behind the house. Jamie and Arch were in the woodshed, but the door was open; I could see them inside, face to face. Jamie saw me hovering, and beckoned me in with a nod.

â€œGood morning, Arch,â€ I said, peering at our erstwhile factor. â€œHow are you?â€

â€œIâ€™ve been better, a nighean, thank ye kindly,â€ he said, and coughed. His voice was little more than a harsh whisper, damaged by smoke, and there were enormous, fluid-filled blisters on both hands and face. Bar the loss of his hair and eyebrows, though, I thought he was otherwise all right.

â€œArch was just about to explain this to me, Sassenach.â€ Jamie pointed a toe at the gleaming metal of the gold ingot lying in the sawdust and wood chips at his feet. â€œWere ye not, Arch?â€

His voice was outwardly pleasant, but I heard the steel in it as clearly as Arch did. Arch Bug was no pushover, though, eyebrows or no eyebrows.

â€œI owe ye nay explanations of anything, Seaumais mac Brian,â€ he said with equal pleasantness.

â€œI give ye the chance of explanation, man, not the choice.â€ Heâ€™d dropped the pleasant tone. Jamie was smudged with soot, and scorched round the edges, but his eyebrows were intact and being put to good use. He turned to me, gesturing to the gold.

â€œYeâ€™ve seen it before, aye?â€

â€œOf course.â€ The last time Iâ€™d seen it, it had been gleaming in the lantern light, packed solid with its fellows in the bottom of a coffin in Hector Cameronâ€™s mausoleum, but the shape of the ingots and the fleur-de-lis stamp were unmistakable. â€œUnless Louis of France has been sending someone else vast quantities of gold, itâ€™s part of Jocastaâ€™s hoard.â€

â€œThat it is not, and never was,â€ Arch corrected me firmly.

â€œAye?â€ Jamie cocked a thick brow at him. â€œTo whom does it belong, then, if not to Jocasta Cameron? Dâ€™ye claim it as your own?â€

â€œI do not.â€ He hesitated, but the urge to speak was powerful. â€œIt is the property of the King,â€ he said, and his old mouth closed tight on the last word.

â€œWhat, the King ofâ€”oh,â€ I said, realizing at long last. â€œThat king.â€

â€œLe roi, câ€™est mort,â€ Jamie said softly, as though to himself, but Arch turned fiercely to him.

â€œIs Scotland dead?â€

Jamie drew breath, but didnâ€™t speak at once. Instead, he gestured me to a seat on the stack of chopped cordwood, and nodded at Arch to take another, before sitting down beside me.

â€œScotland will die when her last son does, a charaid,â€ he said, and waved a hand toward the door, taking in the mountains and hollows around usâ€”and all the people therein. â€œHow many are here? How many will be? Scotland livesâ€”but not in Italy.â€ In Rome, he meant, where Charles Stuart eked out what remained to him of a life, drowning his disappointed dreams of a crown in drink.

Arch narrowed his eyes at this, but kept a stubborn silence.

â€œYe were the third man, were ye not?â€ Jamie asked, disregarding this. â€œWhen the gold was brought ashore from France. Dougal MacKenzie took one-third, and Hector Cameron another. I couldna say what Dougal did with hisâ€”gave it to Charles Stuart, most likely, and may God have mercy on his soul for that. You were tacksman to Malcolm Grant; he sent ye, did he not? You took one-third of the gold on his behalf. Did ye give it to him?â€

Arch nodded, slowly.

â€œIt was given in trust,â€ he said, and his voice cracked. He cleared his throat and spat, the mucus tinged with black. â€œTo me, and then to the Grantâ€”who should have given it in turn to the Kingâ€™s son.â€

â€œDid he?â€ Jamie asked, interested. â€œOr did he think, like Hector Cameron, that it was too late?â€

It had been; the cause was already lost at that pointâ€”no gold could have made a difference. Archâ€™s lips pressed so tightly together as almost to be invisible.

â€œHe did what he did,â€ he said shortly. â€œWhat he thought right. That money was spent for the welfare of the clan. But Hector Cameron was a traitor, and his wife with him.â€

â€œIt was you who spoke to Jocasta in her tent,â€ I said suddenly, realizing. â€œAt the Gathering where you met Jamie. Youâ€™d come there to find her, hadnâ€™t you?â€

Arch seemed surprised that I had spoken, but inclined his head an inch or so in acknowledgment. I wondered whether he had acceptedâ€”had sought?â€”a place with Jamie on account of his relationship with Jocasta.

â€œAnd thatâ€â€”I poked a toe at the shaved ingotâ€”â€œyou found in Jocastaâ€™s house, when you went with Roger and Duncan to bring back the fisher-folk.â€ Proofâ€”if he had needed itâ€”that Jocasta did indeed still have Hectorâ€™s share of the French gold.

â€œWhat I am wondering, myself,â€ Jamie said, rubbing a finger down the long, straight bridge of his nose, â€œis how the devil ye found the rest of it, and then got it away.â€

Archâ€™s lips pursed for a moment, then reluctantly unsealed themselves.

â€œâ€™Twas no great feat. I saw the salt at Hectorâ€™s tombâ€”the way the black slaves kept awaâ€™. If he didna rest easy, it was nay wonderâ€”but where would the gold better be, save wiâ€™ him?â€ A wintry light shone in his faded eyes. â€œI kent Hector Cameron, a bit. He wasna the man to give up anything, only by reason of beinâ€™ dead.â€

Arch made frequent trips to Cross Creek as factor, to buy and trade. He was not usually a guest at River Run, but had been there often enough to be familiar with the property. If anyone saw a figure near the mausoleum at nightâ€”well, everyone knew that Hector Cameronâ€™s ghost â€œwalked,â€ confined to one spot only by the lines of salt; no one would ever go close enough to investigate.

And so he had simply abstracted one ingot on each tripâ€”and not on every tripâ€”eventually removing the whole hoard, before Duncan Innes discovered the loss.

â€œI shouldna have kept out that first ingot, I see that,â€ he said, ruefully nodding at it. â€œAt the first, though, I thought we might have need of itâ€”Murdina and I. And then, when she was obliged to kill yon Brownâ€”â€

Jamieâ€™s head jerked up, and we both stared at him. He coughed.

â€œThe wicked creature grew well enough to poke about the cabin when she was oot; he found thatâ€â€”he nodded again at the ingotâ€”â€œin her workbag, where sheâ€™d hidden it. He couldna ken, of course, what it wasâ€”but he kent well enough that ragged folk such as we ought not to have such a thing.â€ His thin mouth pressed tight again, and I remembered that he had been chief tacksman for the Grant of clan Grantâ€”a man of worth. Once.

â€œHe asked about it, and she wouldna tell him anything, of course. But then, when he made his way to your house, she feared he would tell what heâ€™d seen. And so she made an end to him.â€

It was said calmly; after all, what else could she do? Not for the first time, I wondered just what other things the Bugs had doneâ€”or been forced to doâ€”in the years after Culloden.

â€œWell, ye kept the gold out of King Georgeâ€™s hands, at least,â€ Jamie said, a certain note of bleakness in his voice. I thought he was thinking of the battle at Mooreâ€™s Creek Bridge. If Hugh MacDonald had had that gold, with which to buy powder and arms, the victory there would not have been so easily won. Nor would the Highlanders have been slaughteredâ€”againâ€”charging sword in hand into the mouths of cannon.

â€œArch,â€ I said, when the silence threatened to become oppressive, â€œwhat, exactly, did you plan to do with it?â€

He blinked at that, and looked down at the ingot.

â€œI . . . I meant at first only to see if it was true what Iâ€™d heardâ€”that Hector Cameron had taken his part of the gold away with him, used it for his own ends. Then I found Hector dead, but â€™twas clear from the way his wife lived that he had indeed taken it. So I wonderedâ€”was there any left?â€

One hand crept up, massaging his withered throat.

â€œTo tell ye the truth, mistressâ€”I wished mostly to take it back from Jocasta Cameron. Having done that, though . . .â€ His voice died away, but then he shook himself.

â€œI am a man of my word, Seaumais mac Brian. I swore an oath to my chiefâ€”and kept it, â€™til he died. I swore my oath to the King across the waterâ€â€”James Stuart, he meantâ€”â€œbut he is dead, now, too. And thenâ€”I swore loyalty to George of England when I came upon this shore. So tell me now where my duty lies?â€

â€œYe swore an oath to me, too, Archibald mac Donagh,â€ Jamie said.

Arch smiled at that, a wry expression, but a smile nonetheless.

â€œAnd by reason of that oath, yeâ€™re still alive, Seaumais mac Brian,â€ he said. â€œI could have killed ye last night in your sleep and been well awaâ€™.â€

Jamieâ€™s mouth twisted in a look that expressed considerable doubt of this statement, but he forbore to contradict.

â€œYou are free of your oath to me,â€ he said formally in Gaelic. â€œTake your life from my hand.â€ And inclining his head toward the ingot, said, â€œTake thatâ€”and go.â€

Arch regarded him for a moment, unblinking. Then stooped, picked up the ingot, and went.

â€œYou didnâ€™t ask him where the gold is now,â€ I observed, watching the tall old man make his way round the cabin to rouse his wife.

â€œYe think he would haâ€™ told me?â€ He stood up then, and stretched himself. Then he shook himself like a dog, and went to stand in the doorway of the shed, arms braced in the door frame, looking out. It was beginning to snow again.

â€œI see itâ€™s not only the Frasers who are stubborn as rocks,â€ I said, coming to stand beside him. â€œScotland lives, all right.â€ That made him laugh.

He put one arm around me, and I rested my head on his shoulder.

â€œYour hair smells of smoke, Sassenach,â€ he said softly.

â€œEverything smells of smoke,â€ I replied just as softly.

The burned ruins of the house were still too warm for snow to stick, but that would pass. If it went on snowing, by tomorrow the house would be obliterated, white as the rocks and trees. We, tooâ€”eventually.

I thought of Jocasta and Duncan, gone to the safety of Canada, the welcome of kinfolk. Where would the Bugs goâ€”back to Scotland? For an instant, I longed to go, too. Away from loss and desolation. Home.

But then I remembered.

â€œSo long as one hundred of us remain alive . . . ,â€ I quoted.

Jamie tilted his head against mine for a moment, then raised it and turned to look down at me.

â€œAnd when ye go to a sick manâ€™s bed, Sassenachâ€”to a wounding or a birthâ€”how is it, then, that ye can rise from your own bed, even from mortal weariness, and go in the dark, alone? Why is it that ye willna wait, that ye dinna say no, ever? Why is it that ye willna forbear, even when ye know the case to be hopeless?â€

â€œI canâ€™t.â€ I kept my gaze on the ruin of the house, its ashes growing cold before my eyes. I knew what he meant, the unwelcome truth he would force me to speakâ€”but the truth lay between us, and must be told. â€œI cannot . . . can not . . . admit . . . that there is anything to do but win.â€

He cupped my chin and tilted my face upward, so that I was obliged to meet his eyes. His own face was worn with tiredness, the lines cut deep by eyes and mouth, but the eyes themselves were clear, cool, and fathomless as the waters of a hidden spring.

â€œNor can I,â€ he said.

â€œI know.â€

â€œYe can at least promise me the victory,â€ he said, but his voice held the whisper of a question.

â€œYes,â€ I said, and touched his face. I sounded choked, and my vision blurred. â€œYes, I can promise that. This time.â€ No mention made of what that promise spared, of the things I could not guarantee. Not life, not safety. Not home, nor family; not law nor legacy. Just the one thingâ€”or maybe two.

â€œThe victory,â€ I said. â€œAnd that I will be with you â€™til the end.â€

He closed his eyes for a moment. Snowflakes pelted down, melting as they struck his face, sticking for an instant, white on his lashes. Then he opened his eyes and looked at me.

â€œThat is enough,â€ he said softly. â€œI ask no more.â€

He reached forward then and took me in his arms, held me close for a moment, the breath of snow and ashes cold around us. Then he kissed me, released me, and I took a deep breath of cold air, harsh with the scent of burning. I brushed a floating smut off my arm.

â€œWell . . . good. Bloody good. Er . . .â€ I hesitated. â€œWhat do you suggest we do next?â€

He stood looking at the charred ruin, eyes narrowed, then lifted his shoulders and let them fall.

â€œI think,â€ he said slowly, â€œwe shall goâ€”â€ He stopped suddenly, frowning. â€œWhat in Godâ€™s name . . . ?â€

Something was moving at the side of the house. I blinked away the snowflakes, standing on tiptoe to see better.

â€œOh, it canâ€™t be!â€ I saidâ€”but it was. With a tremendous upheaval of snow, dirt, and charred wood, the white sow thrust her way into daylight. Fully emerged, she shook her massive shoulders, then, pink snout twitching irritably, moved purposefully off toward the wood. A moment later, a smaller version likewise emergedâ€”and another, and another . . . and eight half-grown piglets, some white, some spotted, and one as black as the timbers of the house, trotted off in a line, following their mother.

â€œScotland lives,â€ I said again, giggling uncontrollably. â€œErâ€”where did you say we were going?â€

â€œTo Scotland,â€ he said as though this were obvious. â€œTo fetch my printing press.â€

He was still looking at the house, but his eyes were fixed somewhere beyond the ashes, far beyond the present moment. An owl hooted deep in the distant wood, startled from its sleep. He stood silent for a bit, then shook off his reverie, and smiled at me, snow melting in his hair.

â€œAnd then,â€ he said simply, â€œwe shall come back to fight.â€

He took my hand and turned away from the house, toward the barn where the horses stood waiting, patient in the cold.





EPILOGUE I

LALLYBROCH




THE PENLIGHTâ€™S BEAM MOVED SLOWLY across the heavy oak rafter, paused at a suspicious hole, then passed on. The heavyset man wore a frown of scrupulous concentration, lips pursed like one momentarily expecting some unpleasant surprise.

Brianna stood beside him, looking up at the shadowed recesses of the ceiling in the entry hall, wearing a similar frown of concentration. She would not recognize woodworm or termites unless a rafter actually fell on her, she thought, but it seemed polite to behave as though she were paying attention.

In fact, only half her attention was focused on the heavyset gentlemanâ€™s murmured remarks to his helot, a small young woman in an overall too big for her, with pink streaks in her hair. The other half was focused on the noises from upstairs, where the children were theoretically playing hide â€™n seek among the jumble of packing boxes. Fiona had brought over her brood of three small fiends, and then craftily abandoned them, running off to do an errand of some sort, promising to return by teatime.

Brianna glanced at her wristwatch, still surprised at seeing it there. Half an hour yet to go. If they could avoid bloodshed untilâ€”

A piercing scream from upstairs made her grimace. The helot, less hardened, dropped her clipboard with a yelp.

â€œMAMA!â€ Jem, in tattling mode.

â€œWHAT?â€ she roared in answer. â€œIâ€™m BUSY!â€

â€œBut Mama! Mandy hit me!â€ came an indignant report from the top of the stairs. Looking up, she could see the top of his head, the light from the window glowing on his hair.

â€œShe did? Wellâ€”â€

â€œWith a stick!â€

â€œWhat sort ofâ€”â€

â€œOn purpose!â€

â€œWell, I donâ€™t thinkâ€”â€

â€œAND . . .â€â€”a pause before the damning denouementâ€”â€œSHE DIDNâ€™T SAY SHE WAS SORRY!â€

The builder and his helot had given up looking for woodworm, in favor of following this gripping narrative, and now both of them looked at Brianna, doubtless in expectation of some Solomonic decree.

Brianna closed her eyes momentarily.

â€œMANDY,â€ she bellowed. â€œSay youâ€™re sorry!â€

â€œNonâ€™t!â€ came a high-pitched refusal from above.

â€œAye, ye will!â€ came Jemâ€™s voice, followed by scuffling. Brianna headed for the stair, blood in her eye. Just as she set her foot on the tread, Jem uttered a piercing squeal.

â€œShe BIT me!â€

â€œJeremiah MacKenzie, donâ€™t you dare bite her back!â€ she shouted. â€œBoth of you stop it this instant!â€

Jem thrust a disheveled head through the banister, hair sticking up on end. He was wearing bright blue eye shadow, and someone had applied pink lipstick in a crude mouth-shape from one ear to the other.

â€œSheâ€™s a feisty wee baggage,â€ he ferociously informed the fascinated spectators below. â€œMy grandda said so.â€

Brianna wasnâ€™t sure whether to laugh, cry, or utter a loud shriek, but with a hasty wave at the builder and his assistant, she ran up the stairs to sort them out.

The sorting took rather more time than expected, since she discovered in the process that Fionaâ€™s three little girls, so notably quiet during the latest squabble, had been quiet becauseâ€”having decorated Jem, Mandy, and themselvesâ€”they were busily engaged in painting faces on the bathroom walls with Briannaâ€™s new makeup.

Coming back down a quarter of an hour later, she discovered the builder sitting peaceably on an upturned coal scuttle, having his tea break, while the helot wandered open-mouthed about the entry hall, a half-eaten scone in one hand.

â€œAll those kids yours?â€ she asked Brianna, with a sympathetic quirk of one pierced brow.

â€œNo, thank God. Does everything look all right down here?â€

â€œTouch oâ€™ damp,â€ the builder said cheerfully. â€œOnly to be expected, though, old place like this. Whenâ€™s it built, then, hen, dâ€™ye know?â€

â€œ1721, thickie,â€ the helot said, with comfortable scorn. â€œDid ye not see it carved in the lintel, there, where we came in?â€

â€œNah, then, is it?â€ The builder looked interested, but not enough to get up and look for himself. â€œCost a fortune to put back in shape, wonâ€™t it?â€ He nodded at the wall, where one of the oak panels showed the damage of boots and sabers, crisscrossed with slashes whose rawness had darkened with the years, but still showed clear.

â€œNo, we wonâ€™t fix that,â€ Brianna said, a lump in her throat. â€œThat was done right after the â€™45. Itâ€™ll stay that way.â€ We keep it so, her uncle had told her, to remember always what the English are.

â€œOh, historic-like. Right you are, then,â€ the builder said, nodding wisely. â€œAmericans donâ€™t often mind about the history so much, do they? Wanting all mod cons, electric cookers, effing automatic thisses and thats. Central heating!â€

â€œIâ€™ll settle for toilets that flush,â€ she assured him. â€œThat, and hot water. Speaking of which, will you have a look at the boiler? Itâ€™s in a shed in the yard, and itâ€™s fifty years old if itâ€™s a day. And weâ€™ll want to replace the geyser in the upstairs bath, too.â€

â€œOh, aye.â€ The builder brushed crumbs from his shirt, corked his Thermos flask, and rose ponderously to his feet. â€œCome on, Angie, letâ€™s have a look, then.â€

Brianna hovered suspiciously at the foot of the stair, listening for any sounds of riot before following, but all was well above; she could hear the crash of building blocks, evidently being thrown at the walls, but no yells of outrage. She turned to follow, just in time to see the builder, who had paused to look up at the lintel.

â€œThe â€™45, eh? Ever think what itâ€™d be like?â€ he was saying. â€œIf Bonnie Prince Charlie had won, I mean.â€

â€œOh, in your dreams, Stan! Heâ€™d never a chance, bloody Eyetalian ponce.â€

â€œNaw, naw, heâ€™d have done it, sure, was it no for the effing Campbells. Traitors, aye? To a man. And a woman, too, I expect,â€ he added, laughingâ€”from which Brianna gathered that the helotâ€™s last name was very likely Campbell.

They passed on toward the shed, their argument growing more heated, but she stopped, not wanting to go after them until she had herself under control.

Oh, God, she prayed passionately, oh, Godâ€”that they might be safe! Please, please, let them be safe. It didnâ€™t matter how ridiculous it might be to pray for the safety of people who had beenâ€”who had to beâ€”dead for more than two hundred years. It was the only thing she could do, and did it several times each day, whenever she thought of them. Much more often, now that they had come to Lallybroch.

She blinked back tears, and saw Rogerâ€™s Mini Cooper come down the winding drive. The backseat was piled high with boxes; he was finally clearing out the last bits of rubbish from the Reverendâ€™s garage, salvaging those items that might have value to someoneâ€”a dismayingly high proportion of the contents.

â€œJust in time,â€ she said, a little shaky, as he came up the walk smiling, a large box under his arm. She still found him startling with short hair. â€œTen minutes more, and Iâ€™d kill somebody, for sure. Probably Fiona, for starters.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ He bent and kissed her with particular enthusiasm, indicating that he probably hadnâ€™t heard what sheâ€™d said. â€œIâ€™ve got something.â€

â€œSo I see. Whatâ€”â€

â€œDamned if I know.â€

The box he laid on the ancient dining table was wood, as well; a sizable casket made of maple, darkened by years, soot, and handling, but with the workmanship still apparent to her practiced eye. It was beautifully made, the joints perfectly dovetailed, with a sliding topâ€”but the top didnâ€™t slide, having been at some point sealed with a thick bead of what looked like melted beeswax, gone black with age.

The most striking thing about it, though, was the top. Burned into the wood was a name: Jeremiah Alexander Ian Fraser MacKenzie.

She felt a clenching in her lower belly at the sight of it, and glanced up at Roger, who was tense with some suppressed feeling; she could feel it vibrating through him.

â€œWhat?â€ she whispered. â€œWho is that?â€

Roger shook his head, and pulled a filthy envelope from his pocket.

â€œThis was with it, taped to the side. Itâ€™s the Reverendâ€™s handwriting, one of the little notes heâ€™d sometimes put with something to explain its significance, just in case. But I canâ€™t say this is an explanation, exactly.â€

The note was brief, stating merely that the box had come from a defunct banking house in Edinburgh. Instructions had been stored with the box, stating that it was not to be opened, save by the person whose name was inscribed thereon. The original instructions had perished, but were passed on verbally by the person from whom he obtained the box.

â€œAnd who was that?â€ she asked.

â€œNo idea. Do you have a knife?â€

â€œDo I have a knife,â€ she muttered, digging in the pocket of her jeans. â€œDo I ever not have a knife?â€

â€œThat was a rhetorical question,â€ he said, kissing her hand and taking the bright red Swiss Army knife she offered him.

The beeswax cracked and split away easily; the lid of the box, though, was unwilling to yield after so many years. It took both of themâ€”one clutching the box, the other pushing and pulling on the lidâ€”but finally, it came free with a small squealing noise.

The ghost of a scent floated out; something indistinguishable, but plantlike in origin.

â€œMama,â€ she said involuntarily. Roger glanced at her, startled, but she gestured at him urgently to go on. He reached carefully into the box and removed its contents: a stack of letters, folded and sealed with wax, two booksâ€”and a small snake made of cherrywood, heavily polished by long handling.

She made a small, inarticulate sound and seized the top letter, pressing it so hard against her chest that the paper crackled and the wax seal split and fell away. The thick, soft paper, whose fibers showed the faint stains of what had once been flowers.

Tears were falling down her face, and Roger was saying something, but she didnâ€™t attend the words, and the children were making an uproar upstairs, the builders were still arguing outside, and the only thing in the world she could see were the faded words on the page, written in a sprawling, difficult hand.

December 31, 1776

My dear daughter,

As you will see if ever you receive this, we are alive. . . .





EPILOGUE II

THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS




WHATâ€™S THIS, THEN?â€ Amos Crupp squinted at the page laid out in the bed of the press, reading it backward with the ease of long experience.

â€œIt is with grief that the news is received of the deaths by fire . . . Whereâ€™d that come from?â€

â€œNote from a subscriber,â€ said Sampson, his new printerâ€™s devil, shrugging as he inked the plate. â€œGood for a bit of filler, there, I thought; General Washingtonâ€™s address to the troops run short of the page.â€

â€œHmph. I sâ€™pose. Very old news, though,â€ Crupp said, glancing at the date. â€œJanuary?â€

â€œWell, no,â€ the devil admitted, heaving down on the lever that lowered the page onto the plate of inked type. The press sprang up again, the letters wet and black on the paper, and he picked the sheet off with nimble fingertips, hanging it up to dry. â€œâ€™Twas December, by the notice. But Iâ€™d set the page in Baskerville twelve-point, and the slugs for November and December are missing in that font. Not room to do it in separate letters, and not worth the labor to reset the whole page.â€

â€œTo be sure,â€ said Amos, losing interest in the matter, as he perused the last paragraphs of Washingtonâ€™s speech. â€œScarcely signifies, anyway. After all, theyâ€™re all dead, arenâ€™t they?â€

SPRING THAW



Fraserâ€™s Ridge, colony of North Carolina

March 1777

ONE THING ABOUT a devastating fire, I reflected. It did make packing easier. At present, I owned one gown, one shift, three petticoatsâ€”one woolen, two muslinâ€”two pairs of stockings (Iâ€™d been wearing one pair when the house burned; the other had been carelessly left drying on a bush a few weeks before the fire and was discovered later, weathered but still wearable), a shawl, and a pair of shoes. Jamie had procured a horrible cloak for me somewhereâ€”I didnâ€™t know where, and didnâ€™t want to ask. Made of thick wool the color of leprosy, it smelled as though someone had died in it and lain undiscovered for a couple of days. Iâ€™d boiled it with lye soap, but the ghost of its previous occupant lingered.

Still, I wouldnâ€™t freeze.

My medical kit was nearly as simple to pack. With a regretful sigh for the ashes of my beautiful apothecaryâ€™s chest, with its elegant tools and numerous bottles, I turned over the pile of salvaged remnants from my surgery. The dented barrel of my microscope. Three singed ceramic jars, one missing its lid, one cracked. A large tin of goose grease mixed with camphorâ€”now nearly empty after a winter of catarrhs and coughs. A handful of singed pages, ripped from the casebook started by Daniel Rawlings and continued by myselfâ€”though my spirits were lifted a bit by the discovery that the salvaged pages included one bearing Dr. Rawlingsâ€™s special receipt for Bowel-Bind.

It was the only one of his receipts Iâ€™d found effective, and while Iâ€™d long since committed the actual formula to memory, having it to hand kept my sense of him alive. Iâ€™d never met Daniel Rawlings in life, but heâ€™d been my friend since the day Jamie gave me his chest and casebook. I folded the paper carefully and tucked it into my pocket.

Most of my herbs and compounded medications had perished in the flames, along with the earthenware jars, the glass vials, the large bowls in which I incubated penicillin broth, and my surgical saws. I still had one scalpel and the darkened blade of a small amputation saw; the handle had been charred, but Jamie could make me a new one.

The residents of the Ridge had been generousâ€”as generous as people who had virtually nothing themselves could be at the tail end of winter. We had food for the journey, and many of the women had brought me bits of their household simples; I had small jars of lavender, rosemary, comfrey, and mustard seed, two precious steel needles, a small skein of silk thread to use for sutures and dental floss (though I didnâ€™t mention that last use to the ladies, who would have been deeply affronted by the notion), and a very small stock of bandages and gauze for dressings.

One thing I had in abundance, though, was alcohol. The corncrib had been spared from the flames, and so had the still. Since there was more than enough grain for both animals and household, Jamie had thriftily transformed the rest into a very rawâ€”but potentâ€”liquor, which we would take along to trade for necessary goods along the way. One small cask had been kept for my especial use, though; Iâ€™d carefully painted the legend Sauerkraut on the side, to discourage theft on the road.

â€œAnd what if we should be set upon by illiterate banditti?â€ Jamie had asked, amused by this.

â€œThought of that,â€ I informed him, displaying a small corked bottle full of cloudy liquid. â€œEau de sauerkraut. Iâ€™ll pour it on the cask at first sight of anyone suspicious.â€

â€œI suppose weâ€™d best hope theyâ€™re not German bandits, then.â€

â€œHave you ever met a German bandit?â€ I asked. With the exception of the occasional drunkard or wife-beater, almost all the Germans we knew were honest, hardworking, and virtuous to a fault. Not all that surprising, given that so many of them had come to the colony as part of a religious movement.

â€œNot as such,â€ he admitted. â€œBut ye mind the Muellers, aye? And what they did to your friends. They wouldna have called themselves bandits, but the Tuscarora likely didna make the same distinction.â€

That was no more than the truth, and a cold thumb pressed the base of my skull. The Muellers, German neighbors, had had a beloved daughter and her newborn child die of measles, and had blamed the nearby Indians for the infection. Deranged by grief, old Herr Mueller had led a party of his sons and sons-in-law to take revengeâ€”and scalps. My viscera still remembered the shock of seeing my friend Nayawenneâ€™s white-streaked hair spill out of a bundle into my lap.

â€œIs my hair turning white, do you think?â€ I said abruptly. He raised his eyebrows, but bent forward and peered at the top of my head, fingering gently through my hair.

â€œThereâ€™s maybe one hair in fifty thatâ€™s gone white. One in five-and-twenty is silver. Why?â€

â€œI suppose I have a little time, then. Nayawenne â€¦â€ I hadnâ€™t spoken her name aloud in several years, and found an odd comfort in the speaking, as though it had conjured her. â€œShe told me that Iâ€™d come into my full power when my hair turned white.â€

â€œNow thereâ€™s a fearsome thought,â€ he said, grinning.

â€œNo doubt. Since it hasnâ€™t happened yet, though, I suppose if we stumble into a nest of sauerkraut thieves on the road, Iâ€™ll have to defend my cask with my scalpel,â€ I said.

He gave me a slightly queer look at this, but then laughed and shook his head.

His own packing was a little more involved. He and Young Ian had removed the gold from the houseâ€™s foundation the night after Mrs. Bugâ€™s funeralâ€”a delicate process preceded by my putting out a large slop basin of stale bread soaked in corn liquor, then calling â€œSooo-eeee!â€ at the top of my lungs from the head of the garden path.

A moment of silence, and then the white sow emerged from her den, a pale blotch against the smoke-stained rocks of the foundation. I knew exactly what she was, but the sight of that white, rapidly moving form still made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. It had come on to snowâ€”one of the reasons for Jamieâ€™s decision to act at onceâ€”and she came through the whirl of big, soft flakes with a velocity that made her seem like the spirit of the storm itself, leading the wind.

For an instant, I thought she was going to charge me; I saw her head swing toward me and caught the loud snuff as she took my scentâ€”but she scented the food as well, and swerved away. An instant later, the ungodly sounds of a pig in ecstasy floated through the hush of the snow, and Jamie and Ian hurried out of the trees to begin their work.

It took more than two weeks to move the gold; they worked only at night, and only when fresh snow was either falling or about to fall, to cover their tracks. Meantime, they took it in turn to guard the remains of the Big House, keeping an eye peeled for any sign of Arch Bug.

â€œDo you think he still cares about the gold?â€ Iâ€™d asked Jamie in the midst of this endeavor, chafing his hands to get enough heat into them for him to hold his spoon. Heâ€™d come in for breakfast, frozen and exhausted after a long night spent walking round and round the burnt house to keep his blood flowing.

â€œHeâ€™s no much else left to care about, has he?â€ He spoke softly, to avoid waking the Higgins family. â€œOther than Ian.â€

I shivered, as much from thought of old Arch, living wraithlike in the forest, surviving on the heat of his hatred, as from the cold that had come in with Jamie. Heâ€™d let his beard grow for warmthâ€”all the men did in winter, on the mountainâ€”and ice glimmered in his whiskers and frosted his brows.

â€œYou look like Old Man Winter himself,â€ I whispered, bringing him a bowl of hot porridge.

â€œI feel like it,â€ he replied hoarsely. He passed the bowl under his nose, inhaling the steam and closing his eyes beatifically. â€œPass the whisky, aye?â€

â€œYouâ€™re proposing to pour it on your porridge? Itâ€™s got butter and salt on, already.â€ Nonetheless, I passed him the bottle from its shelf over the hearth.

â€œNay, Iâ€™m going to thaw my wame enough to eat it. Iâ€™m solid ice from the neck down.â€

No one had seen hide nor hair of Arch Bugâ€”not even an errant track in the snowâ€”since his appearance at the funeral. He might be denned up for the winter, snug in some refuge. He might have gone away to the Indian villages. He might be dead, and I rather hoped he was, uncharitable as the thought might be.

I mentioned this, and Jamie shook his head. The ice in his hair had melted now, and the firelight glimmered like diamonds on the water droplets in his beard.

â€œIf heâ€™s dead, and we never learn of it, Ian willna have a momentâ€™s peaceâ€”ever. Dâ€™ye want him to be looking over his shoulder at his wedding, afraid of a bullet through his wifeâ€™s heart as she speaks her vows? Or wed with a family, fearing each day to leave his house and his bairns, for fear of what he might come back to?â€

â€œIâ€™m impressed at the scope and morbidity of your imaginationâ€”but youâ€™re right. All right, I donâ€™t hope heâ€™s deadâ€”not unless we find his body.â€

But no one did find his body, and the gold was moved, bit by bit, to its new hiding place.

That had taken a bit of thought and considerable private discussion between Jamie and Ian. Not the whisky cave. Very few people knew about thatâ€”but some did. Joseph Wemyss, his daughter, Lizzie, and her two husbandsâ€”I marveled, rather, that Iâ€™d got to the point where I could think about Lizzie and the Beardsleys without bogglingâ€”all knew, of necessity, and Bobby and Amy Higgins would need to be shown its location before we left, as they would be making whisky themselves in our absence. Arch Bug had not been told of the caveâ€™s locationâ€”but very likely knew it.

Jamie was adamant that no one should know even of the goldâ€™s existence on the Ridge, let alone its location.

â€œLet even a rumor of it get out, and everyone here is in danger,â€ heâ€™d said. â€œYe ken what happened when yon Donner told folk we had jewels here.â€

I kent, all right. I still woke up in the midst of nightmares, hearing the muffled whumph! of exploding ether fumes, hearing the crash of glass and smashing wood as the raiders wrecked the house.

In some of these dreams, I ran fruitlessly to and fro, trying to rescue someoneâ€”who?â€”but met always by locked doors, blank walls, or rooms engulfed in flame. In others, I stood rooted, unable to move a muscle, as fire crawled up the walls, fed with delicate greed on the clothes of bodies at my feet, burst through a corpseâ€™s hair, caught in my skirts and swarmed upward, wrapping my legs in a blazing web.

I still felt overpowering sadnessâ€”and a deep, cleansing rageâ€”when I looked at the sooty smudge in the clearing that had once been my home, but I always had to go out in the morning after one of these dreams and look at it nonetheless: walk round the cold ruins and smell the taint of dead ash, in order to quench the flames that burned behind my eyes.

â€œRight,â€ I said, and pulled my shawl tighter round me. We were standing by the springhouse, looking down on the ruins as we talked, and the chill was seeping into my bones. â€œSo â€¦ where, then?â€

â€œThe Spaniardâ€™s Cave,â€ he said, and I blinked at him.

â€œThe what?â€

â€œIâ€™ll show ye, a nighean,â€ he said, grinning at me. â€œWhen the snow melts.â€



SPRING HAD SPRUNG, and the creek was rising. Swelled by melting snow and fed by hundreds of tiny waterfalls that trickled and leapt down the mountainâ€™s face, it roared past my feet, exuberant with spray. I could feel it cold on my face, and knew that Iâ€™d be wet to the knees within minutes, but it didnâ€™t matter. The fresh green of arrowhead and pickerelweed rimmed the banks, some plants dragged out of the soil by the rising water and whirled downstream, more hanging on by their roots for dear life, leaves trailing in the racing wash. Dark mats of cress swirled under the water, close by the sheltering banks. And fresh greens were what I wanted.

My gathering basket was half full of fiddleheads and ramp shoots. A nice big lot of tender new cress, crisp and cold from the stream, would top off the winterâ€™s vitamin C deficiency very well. I took off my shoes and stockings, and after a momentâ€™s hesitation, took off my gown and shawl as well and hung them over a tree branch. The air was chilly in the shade of the silver birches that overhung the creek here, and I shivered a bit but ignored the cold, kirtling up my shift before wading into the stream.

That cold was harder to ignore. I gasped, and nearly dropped the basket, but found my footing among the slippery rocks and made my way toward the nearest mat of tempting dark green. Within seconds, my legs were numb, and Iâ€™d lost any sense of cold in the enthusiasm of foragerâ€™s frenzy and salad hunger.

A good deal of our stored food had been saved from the fire, as it was kept in the outbuildings: the springhouse, corncrib, and smoking shed. The root cellar had been destroyed, though, and with it not only the carrots, onions, garlic, and potatoes but most of my carefully gathered stock of dried apples and wild yams, and the big hanging clusters of raisins, all meant to keep us from the ravages of scurvy. The herbs, of course, had gone up in smoke, along with the rest of my surgery. True, a large quantity of pumpkins and squashes had escaped, these having been piled in the barn, but one grows tired of squash pie and succotash after a couple of monthsâ€”well, after a couple of days, speaking personally.

Not for the first time, I mourned Mrs. Bugâ€™s abilities as a cook, though of course I did miss her for her own sake. Amy McCallum Higgins had been raised in a crofterâ€™s cottage in the Highlands of Scotland and was, as she put it, â€œa good plain cook.â€ Essentially, that meant she could bake bannocks, boil porridge, and fry fish simultaneously, without burning any of it. No mean feat, but a trifle monotonous, in terms of diet.

My own piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance was stewâ€”which, lacking onions, garlic, carrots, and potatoes, had devolved into a sort of pottage consisting of venison or turkey stewed with cracked corn, barley, and possibly chunks of stale bread. Ian, surprisingly, had turned out to be a passable cook; the succotash and squash pie were his contributions to the communal menu. I did wonder who had taught him to make them, but thought it wiser not to ask.

So far no one had starved, nor yet lost any teeth, but by mid-March, I would have been willing to wade neck-deep in freezing torrents in order to acquire something both edible and green.

Ian had, thank goodness, gone on breathing. And after a week or so had ceased acting quite so shell-shocked, eventually regaining something like his normal manner. But I noticed Jamieâ€™s eyes follow him now and then, and Rollo had taken to sleeping with his head on Ianâ€™s chest, a new habit. I wondered whether he really sensed the pain in Ianâ€™s heart, or whether it was simply a response to the cramped sleeping conditions in the cabin.

I stretched my back, hearing the small pops between my vertebrae. Now that the snowmelt had come, I could hardly wait for our departure. I would miss the Ridge and everyone on itâ€”well, almost everyone. Possibly not Hiram Crombie, so much. Or the Chisholms, orâ€”I short-circuited this list before it became uncharitable.

â€œOn the other hand,â€ I said firmly to myself, â€œthink of beds.â€

Granted, we would be spending a good many nights on the road, sleeping roughâ€”but eventually we would reach civilization. Inns. With food. And beds. I closed my eyes momentarily, envisioning the absolute bliss of a mattress. I didnâ€™t even aspire to a feather bed; anything that promised more than an inch of padding between myself and the floor would be paradise. And, of course, if it came with a modicum of privacyâ€”even better.

Jamie and I had not been completely celibate since December. Lust asideâ€”and it wasnâ€™tâ€”we needed the comfort and warmth of each otherâ€™s body. Still, covert congress under a quilt, with Rolloâ€™s yellow eyes fixed upon us from two feet away, was less than ideal, even assuming that Young Ian was invariably asleep, which I didnâ€™t think he was, though he was sufficiently tactful as to pretend.

A hideous shriek split the air, and I jerked, dropping the basket. I flung myself after it, barely snatching the handle before it was whirled away on the flood, and stood up dripping and trembling, heart hammering as I waited to see whether the scream would be repeated.

It wasâ€”followed in short order by an equally piercing screech, but one deeper in timbre and recognizable to my well-trained ears as the sort of noise made by a Scottish Highlander suddenly immersed in freezing water. Fainter, higher-pitched shrieks, and a breathless â€œFook!â€ spoken in a Dorset accent indicated that the gentlemen of the household were taking their spring bath.

I wrang out the hem of my shift and, snatching my shawl from the branch where Iâ€™d left it, slipped on my shoes and made my way in the direction of the bellowing.

There are few things more enjoyable than sitting in relative warmth and comfort while watching fellow human beings soused in cold water. If said human beings present a complete review of the nude male form, so much the better. I threaded my way through a small growth of fresh-budding river willows, found a conveniently screened rock in the sun, and spread out the damp skirt of my shift, enjoying the warmth on my shoulders, the sharp scent of the fuzzy catkins, and the sight before me.

Jamie was standing in the pool, nearly shoulder-deep, his hair slicked back like a russet seal. Bobby stood on the bank, and picking up Aidan with a grunt, threw him to Jamie in a pinwheel of flailing limbs and piercing shrieks of delighted fright.

â€œMe-me-me-me!â€ Orrie was dancing around his stepfatherâ€™s legs, his chubby bottom bouncing up and down among the reeds like a little pink balloon.

Bobby laughed, bent, and hoisted him up, holding him for a moment high overhead as he squealed like a seared pig, then flung him in a shallow arc out over the pool.

He hit the water with a tremendous splash and Jamie grabbed him, laughing, and pulled him to the surface, whence he emerged with a look of open-mouthed stupefaction that made them all hoot like gibbons. Aidan and Rollo were both dog-paddling round in circles by now, shouting and barking.

I looked across to the opposite side of the pool and saw Ian rush naked down the small hill and leap like a salmon into the pool, uttering one of his best Mohawk war cries. This was cut off abruptly by the cold water, and he vanished with scarcely a splash.

I waitedâ€”as did the othersâ€”for him to pop back up, but he didnâ€™t. Jamie looked suspiciously behind him, in case of a sneak attack, but an instant later Ian shot out of the water directly in front of Bobby with a bloodcurdling yell, grabbed him by the leg, and yanked him in.

Matters thereafter became generally chaotic, with a great deal of promiscuous splashing, yelling, hooting, and jumping off of rocks, which gave me the opportunity to reflect on just how delightful naked men are. Not that I hadnâ€™t seen a good many of them in my time, but aside from Frank and Jamie, most men Iâ€™d seen undressed usually had been either ill or injured, and were encountered in such circumstances as to prevent a leisurely appreciation of their finer attributes.

From Orrieâ€™s chubbiness and Aidanâ€™s spidery winter-white limbs to Bobbyâ€™s skinny, pale torso and neat little flat behind, the McCallum-Higginses were as entertaining to watch as a cageful of monkeys.

Ian and Jamie were something differentâ€”baboons, perhaps, or mandrills. They didnâ€™t really resemble each other in any attribute other than height, and yet were plainly cut from the same cloth. Watching Jamie squatting on a rock above the pool, thighs tensing for a leap, I could easily see him preparing to attack a leopard, while Ian stretched himself glistening in the sun, warming his dangly bits while keeping an alert watch for intruders. All they needed were purple bottoms, and they could have walked straight onto the African veldt, no questions asked.

They were all lovely, in their wildly various ways, but it was Jamie my gaze returned to, over and over again. He was battered and scarred, his muscles roped and knotted, and age had grooved the hollows between them. The thick welt of the bayonet scar writhed up his thigh, wide and ugly, while the thinner white line of the scar left by a rattlesnakeâ€™s bite was nearly invisible, clouded by the thick fuzz of his body hair, this beginning to dry now and stand out from his skin in a cloud of reddish-gold. The scimitar-shaped sword cut across his ribs had healed well, too, no more than a hair-thin white line by now.

He turned round and bent to pick up a cake of soap from the rock, and my insides turned over. It wasnâ€™t purple but could not otherwise have been improved on, being high, round, delicately dusted with red-gold, and with a delightful muscular concavity to the sides. His balls, just visible from behind, were purple with the cold, and gave me a strong urge to creep up behind him and cup them in my rock-warmed hands.

I wondered whether the resultant standing broad-jump would enable him to clear the pool.

I had not, in fact, seen him nakedâ€”or even substantially undressedâ€”in several months.

But now â€¦ I threw back my head, closing my eyes against the brilliant spring sun, enjoying the tickle of my own fresh-washed hair against my shoulder blades. The snow was gone, the weather was goodâ€”and the whole outdoors beckoned invitingly, filled with places where privacy could be assured, bar the odd skunk.



I LEFT THE MEN dripping and sunning themselves on the rocks, and went to retrieve my clothes. I didnâ€™t put these on, though. Instead, I went quickly up to the springhouse, where I submerged my basket of greens in the cool waterâ€”if I took it to the cabin, Amy would seize them and boil them into submissionâ€”and left my gown, stays, and stockings rolled up on the shelf where the cheeses were stacked. Then I went back toward the stream.

The splashing and shouting had ceased. Instead, I heard low-voiced singing, coming along the trail. It was Bobby, carrying Orrie, sound asleep after his exertions. Aidan, groggy with cleanliness and warmth, ambled slowly beside his stepfather, dark head tilting to and fro to the rhythm of the song.

It was a lovely Gaelic lullaby; Amy must have taught it to Bobby. I did wonder if sheâ€™d told him what the words meant.

(Many a night, wet and dry

Even in the worst of weather

Gregor would find a little rock for me

Beside which I could shelter.)

(Woe is me, woe is me

Woe is me, great indeed is my sorrow.)

I smiled to see them, though with a catch in my throat. I remembered Jamie carrying Jem back from swimming, the summer before, and Roger singing to Mandy in the night, his harsh, cracked voice little more than a whisperâ€”but music, all the same.

I nodded to Bobby, who smiled and nodded back, though without interrupting his song. He raised his brows and jerked a thumb over his shoulder and uphill, presumably indicating where Jamie had gone. He betrayed no surprise at seeing me in shift and shawlâ€”doubtless he thought I was bound for the stream to wash, as well, inspired by the singular warmth of the day.

(Great sweetheart of all people of the world

Woe is me, great indeed is my sorrow.)

I waved briefly and turned up the side trail that led to the upper clearing. â€œNew House,â€ everyone called it, though the only indications that there might someday be a house there were a stack of felled logs and a number of pegs driven into the ground, with strings tied between them. These were meant to mark the placement and dimensions of the house Jamie intended to build in replacement of the Big Houseâ€”when we came back.

Heâ€™d been moving the pegs, I saw. The wide front room was now wider, and the back room intended for my surgery had developed a growth of some sort, perhaps a separate stillroom.

The architect was sitting on a log, surveying his kingdom, stark naked.

â€œExpecting me, were you?â€ I asked, taking off my shawl and hanging it on a convenient branch.

â€œI was.â€ He smiled, and scratched his chest. â€œI thought the sight of my naked backside would likely inflame ye. Or was it maybe Bobbyâ€™s?â€

â€œBobby hasnâ€™t got one. Do you know, you havenâ€™t got a single gray hair below the neck? Why is that, I wonder?â€

He glanced down, inspecting himself, but it was true. There were only a few strands of silver among the fiery mass of his hair, though his beardâ€”the winter growth tediously and painfully removed a few days beforeâ€”was heavily frosted with white. But the hair on his chest was still a dark auburn, and that below a fluffy mass of vivid ginger.

He combed his fingers thoughtfully through the exuberant foliage, looking down.

â€œI think itâ€™s hiding,â€ he remarked, and glanced up at me, one eyebrow raised. â€œWant to come and help me hunt for it?â€

I came round in front of him and obligingly knelt down. The object in question was in fact quite visible, though admittedly looking rather shell-shocked by the recent immersion, and a most interesting shade of pale blue.

â€œWell,â€ I said, after a momentâ€™s contemplation. â€œGreat oaks from tiny acorns grow. Or so Iâ€™m told.â€

A shiver ran through him at the warmth of my mouth and I lifted my hands involuntarily, cradling his balls.

â€œHoly God,â€ he said, and his hands rested lightly on my head in benediction.

â€œWhat did ye say?â€ he asked, a moment later.

â€œI said,â€ I said, coming up momentarily for air, â€œI find the gooseflesh rather erotic.â€

â€œThereâ€™s more where that came from,â€ he assured me. â€œTake your shift off, Sassenach. I havena seen ye naked in nearly four months.â€

â€œWell â€¦ no, you havenâ€™t,â€ I agreed, hesitating. â€œAnd Iâ€™m not sure I want you to.â€

One eyebrow went up.

â€œWhyever not?â€

â€œBecause Iâ€™ve been indoors for weeks on end without sun or exercise to speak of. I probably look like one of those grubs you find under rocksâ€”fat, white, and squidgy.â€

â€œSquidgy?â€ he repeated, breaking into a grin.

â€œSquidgy,â€ I said with dignity, wrapping my arms around myself.

He pursed his lips and exhaled slowly, eyeing me with his head on one side.

â€œI like it when yeâ€™re fat, but I ken quite well that yeâ€™re not,â€ he said, â€œbecause Iâ€™ve felt your ribs when I put my arms about you, each night since the end of January. As for whiteâ€”yeâ€™ve been white all the time Iâ€™ve known ye; itâ€™s no likely to come a great shock to me. As for the squidgy partâ€â€”he extended one hand and wiggled the fingers beckoningly at meâ€”â€I think I might enjoy that.â€

â€œHmm,â€ I said, still hesitant. He sighed.

â€œSassenach,â€ he said, â€œI said I havena seen ye naked in four months. That means if ye take your shift off now, yeâ€™ll be the best thing Iâ€™ve seen in four months. And at my age, I dinna think I remember farther back than that.â€

I laughed, and without further ado, stood up and pulled the ribbon tie at the neck of my shift. Wriggling, I let it fall in a puddle round my feet.

He closed his eyes. Then breathed deep and opened them again.

â€œIâ€™m blinded,â€ he said softly, and held out a hand to me.

â€œBlinded as in sun bouncing off a vast expanse of snow?â€ I asked dubiously. â€œOr as in coming face to face with a gorgon?â€

â€œSeeing a gorgon turns ye to stone, not strikes ye blind,â€ he informed me. â€œThough come to thinkâ€â€”he prodded himself with an experimental forefingerâ€”â€I may turn to stone yet. Will ye come here, for Godâ€™s sake?â€

I came.



I FELL ASLEEP IN the warmth of Jamieâ€™s body, and woke some time later, snugly wrapped in his plaid. I stretched, alarming a squirrel overhead, who ran out on a limb to get a better view. Evidently he didnâ€™t like what he saw, and began scolding and chattering.

â€œOh, hush,â€ I said, yawning, and sat up. The squirrel took exception to this gesture and began having hysterics, but I ignored him. To my surprise, Jamie was gone.

I thought heâ€™d likely just stepped into the wood to relieve himself, but a quick glance round didnâ€™t discover him, and when I scrambled to my feet, the plaid clutched to me, I saw no sign of him.

I hadnâ€™t heard anything; surely if someone had come, I would have wakenedâ€”or Jamie would have wakened me. I listened carefully, butâ€”the squirrel having now gone about its own businessâ€”heard nothing beyond the normal sounds of a forest waking to spring: the murmur and rush of wind through new-leafed trees, punctuated by the occasional crack of a falling branch, or the rattle of last yearâ€™s pinecones and chestnut hulls bouncing through the canopy; the call of a distant jay, the conversation of a gang of pygmy nuthatches foraging in the long grass nearby, the rustle of a hungry vole in the winterâ€™s dead leaves.

The jay was still calling; another had joined it now, shrill with alarm. Perhaps that was where Jamie had gone.

I unwound myself from the plaid and pulled on my shift and shoes. It was getting on for evening; weâ€”or I, at leastâ€”had slept a long time. It was still warm in the sun, but the shadows under the trees were cold, and I put on my shawl and bundled up Jamieâ€™s plaid into my armsâ€”likely heâ€™d want it.

I followed the calling of the jays uphill, away from the clearing. There was a pair nesting near the White Spring; Iâ€™d seen them building the nest only two days before.

It wasnâ€™t far from the house site at all, though that particular spring always had the air of being remote from everything. It lay in the center of a small grove of white ash and hemlock, and was shielded on the east by a jagged outcropping of lichen-covered rock. All water has a sense of life about it, and a mountain spring carries a particular sense of quiet joy, rising pure from the heart of the earth. The White Spring, so called for the big pale boulder that stood guardian over its pool, had something moreâ€”a sense of inviolate peace.

The closer I came to it, the surer I was that that was where Iâ€™d find Jamie.

â€œThereâ€™s something there that listens,â€ heâ€™d told Brianna once, quite casually. â€œYe see such pools in the Highlands; theyâ€™re called saintsâ€™ poolsâ€”folk say the saint lives by the pool and listens to their prayers.â€

â€œAnd what saint lives by the White Spring?â€ sheâ€™d asked, cynical. â€œSaint Killian?â€

â€œWhy him?â€

â€œPatron saint of gout, rheumatism, and whitewashers.â€

Heâ€™d laughed at that, shaking his head.

â€œWhatever it is that lives in such water is older than the notion of saints,â€ he assured her. â€œBut it listens.â€

I walked softly, approaching the spring. The jays had fallen silent now.

He was there, sitting on a rock by the water, wearing only his shirt. I saw why the jays had gone about their businessâ€”he was still as the white boulder itself, his eyes closed, hands turned upward on his knees, loosely cupped, inviting grace.

I stopped at once when I saw him. I had seen him pray here once beforeâ€”when heâ€™d asked Dougal MacKenzie for help in battle. I didnâ€™t know who he was talking to just now, but it wasnâ€™t a conversation I wished to intrude upon.

I ought to leave, I supposedâ€”but aside from the fear that I might disturb him by an inadvertent noise, I didnâ€™t want to go. Most of the spring lay in shadow, but fingers of light came down through the trees, stroking him. The air was thick with pollen, and the light was filled with motes of gold. It struck answering glints from the crown of his head, the smooth high arch of his foot, the blade of his nose, the bones of his face. He might have grown there, part of earth and stone and water, might have been himself the spirit of the spring.

I didnâ€™t feel unwelcome. The peace of the place reached out to touch me gently, slow my heart.

Was that what he sought here, I wondered? Was he drawing the peace of the mountain into himself, to remember, to sustain him during the monthsâ€”the years, perhapsâ€”of coming exile?

I would remember.

The light began to go, brightness falling from the air. He stirred, finally, lifting his head a little.

â€œLet me be enough,â€ he said quietly.

I started at the sound of his voice, but he hadnâ€™t been speaking to me.

He opened his eyes and rose then, quiet as heâ€™d sat, and came past the stream, long feet bare and silent on the layers of damp leaves. As he came past the outcropping of rock, he saw me and smiled, reaching out to take the plaid I held out to him, wordless. He said nothing, but took my cold hand in his large warm one and we turned toward home, walking together in the mountainâ€™s peace.



A FEW DAYS LATER, he came to find me. I was foraging along the creek bank for leeches, which had begun to emerge from their winterâ€™s hibernation, ravenous for blood. They were simple to catch; I merely waded slowly through the water near shore.

At first, the thought of acting as live bait for the leeches was repellent, but after all, that was how I usually obtained leechesâ€”by letting Jamie, Ian, Bobby, or any of a dozen young males wade through the streams and pick them off. And once you got used to the sight of the creatures, slowly engorging with your blood, it wasnâ€™t all that bad.

â€œI have to let them have enough blood to sustain themselves,â€ I explained, grimacing as I eased a thumbnail under the sucker of a leech in order to dislodge it, â€œbut not enough that theyâ€™ll be comatose, or they wonâ€™t be of any use.â€

â€œA matter of nice judgment,â€ Jamie agreed, as I dropped the leech into a jar filled with water and duckweed. â€œWhen yeâ€™ve done feeding your wee pets, then, come along and Iâ€™ll show ye the Spaniardâ€™s Cave.â€

It was no little distance. Perhaps four miles from the Ridge, through cold, muddy creeks and up steep slopes, then through a crack in a granite cliff face that made me feel as though I were being entombed alive, only to emerge into a wilderness of jutting boulders, smothered in nets of wild grape.

â€œWe found it, Jem and I, out hunting one day,â€ Jamie explained, lifting a curtain of leaves for me to pass beneath. The vines snaked over the rocks, thick as a manâ€™s forearm and knotted with age, the rusty-green leaves of spring not yet quite covering them. â€œIt was a secret between us. We agreed weâ€™d tell no one elseâ€”not even his parents.â€

â€œNor me,â€ I said, but wasnâ€™t offended. I heard the loss in his voice at the mention of Jem.

The entrance to the cave was a crack in the ground, over which Jamie had pushed a large, flat rock. He slid this back with some effort, and I bent over cautiously, experiencing a brief clench of the innards at the faint sound of moving air through the fissure. The surface air was warm, though; the cave was drawing, not blowing.

I remembered all too well the cave at Abandawe, that had seemed to breathe around us, and it took some force of will to follow Jamie as he disappeared into the earth. There was a rough wooden ladderâ€”new, I saw, but replacing a much older one that had fallen to pieces; some bits of rotted wood were still in place, dangling from the rock on rusted iron spikes.

It could have been no more than ten or twelve feet to the bottom, but the neck of the cave was narrow, and the descent seemed endless. At last I reached the bottom, though, and saw that the cave had opened out, like the bottom of a flask. Jamie was crouched to one side; I saw him draw out a small bottle and smelled the sharp scent of turpentine.

Heâ€™d brought a torch, a pine knot with a head dipped in tar and wrapped with a rag. He soaked the rag with turpentine, then drew the fire-starter Bree had made for him. A shower of sparks lit his face, intent and ruddy. Twice more, and the torch caught, the flame bursting through the flammable cloth and catching the tar.

He lifted the torch, and gestured toward the floor behind me. I turned and nearly jumped out of my skin.

The Spaniard leaned against the wall, bony legs stretched out, skull fallen forward as if in a doze. Tufts of reddish, faded hair still clung here and there, but the skin had gone entirely. His hands and feet were mostly gone, too, the small bones carried away by rodents. No large animals had been able to get at him, though, and while the torso and long bones showed signs of nibbling, they were largely intact; the swell of the rib cage poked through a tissue of cloth so faded that there was no telling what color it had ever been.

He was a Spaniard, too. A crested metal helmet, red with rust, lay by him, along with an iron breastplate and a knife.

â€œJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,â€ I whispered. Jamie crossed himself, and knelt by the skeleton.

â€œIâ€™ve no notion how long heâ€™s been here,â€ he said, also low-voiced. â€œWe didna find anything with him save the armor and that.â€ He pointed to the gravel just in front of the pelvis. I leaned closer to look; a small crucifix, probably silver, now tarnished black, and a few inches away, a tiny triangular shape, also black.

â€œA rosary?â€ I asked, and Jamie nodded.

â€œI expect he was wearing it about his neck. It must have been made of wood and string, and when it rotted, the metal bits fell. Thatâ€â€”his finger gently touched the little triangleâ€”â€says Nr. Sra. Ang. on the one sideâ€”Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Angeles, I think it means, â€˜Our Lady of the Angels.â€™ Thereâ€™s a wee picture of the Blessed Virgin on the other side.â€

I crossed myself by reflex.

â€œWas Jemmy scared?â€ I asked, after a momentâ€™s respectful silence.

â€œI was,â€ Jamie said dryly. â€œIt was dark when I came down the shaft, and I nearly stepped on this fellow. I thought he was alive, and the shock of it liked to stop my heart.â€

Heâ€™d cried out in alarm, and Jemmy, left aboveground with strict instructions not to move from the spot, had promptly scrambled into the hole, losing his grip of the broken ladder halfway down and landing feetfirst on his grandfather.

â€œI heard him scrabbling and looked up, just in time to have him plunge out of the heavens and strike me in the breast like a cannonball.â€ Jamie rubbed the left side of his chest with rueful amusement. â€œIf I hadnâ€™t looked up, heâ€™d have broken my neckâ€”and heâ€™d never have got out, by himself.â€

And weâ€™d never have known what happened to either one of you. I swallowed, dry-mouthed at the thought. And yet â€¦ on any given day, something just as random might happen. To anyone.

â€œA wonder neither one of you broke anything,â€ I said instead, and gestured toward the skeleton. â€œWhat do you think happened to this gentleman?â€ His people never knew.

Jamie shook his head.

â€œI dinna ken. He wasna expecting an enemy, because he wasna wearing his armor.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t think he fell in and couldnâ€™t get out?â€ I squatted by the skeleton, tracing the tibia of the left leg. The bone was dried and cracked, gnawed at the end by small sharp teethâ€”but I could see what might be a greenstick fracture of the bone. Or might just be the cracking of age.

Jamie shrugged, glancing up.

â€œI shouldna think so. He was a good bit shorter than I am, but I think the original ladder must have been here when he diedâ€”for if someone built the ladder later, why would they leave this gentleman here at the bottom of it? And even with a broken leg, he should have been able to climb it.â€

â€œHmm. He might have died of a fever, I suppose. That would account for his taking off his breastplate and helmet.â€ Though I personally would have taken them off at the first opportunity; depending on the season, he must either have been boiled alive or suffered severely from mildew, semi-enclosed in metal.

â€œMmphm.â€

I glanced up at this sound, which indicated dubious acceptance of my reasoning but disagreement with my conclusion.

â€œYou think he was killed?â€

He shrugged.

â€œHe has armorâ€”but nay weapon save a wee knife. And ye can see he was right-handed, but the knifeâ€™s lying to his left.â€

The skeleton had been right-handed; the bones of the right arm were noticeably thicker, even by the flicker of torchlight. Possibly a swordsman? I wondered.

â€œI kent a good many Spanish soldiers in the Indies, Sassenach. All of them fair bristled wiâ€™ swords and spears and pistols. If this man died of a fever, his companions might take his armsâ€”but theyâ€™d take the armor, too, and the knife. Why leave it?â€

â€œBut by that token,â€ I objected, â€œwhy did whoever killed himâ€”if he was killedâ€”leave the armor and the knife?â€

â€œAs for the armorâ€”they didna want it. It wouldna be particularly useful to anyone other than a soldier. As for the knifeâ€”because it was sticking in him?â€ Jamie suggested. â€œAnd itâ€™s no a very good knife to begin with.â€

â€œVery logical,â€ I said, swallowing again. â€œPutting aside the question of how he diedâ€”what in Godâ€™s name was he doing in the mountains of North Carolina in the first place?â€

â€œThe Spanish sent explorers up as far as Virginia, fifty or sixty years ago,â€ he informed me. â€œThe swamps discouraged them, though.â€

â€œI can see why. But why. â€¦ this?â€ I stood up, waving a hand to encompass the cave and its ladder. He didnâ€™t reply, but took my arm and lifted his torch, turning me to the side of the cave opposite the ladder. Well above my head, I saw another small fissure in the rock, black in the torchlight, barely wide enough for a man to wriggle through.

â€œThereâ€™s a smaller cave through there,â€ he said, nodding upward. â€œAnd when I put Jem up to look, he told me there were marks in the dustâ€”square marks, as though heavy boxes had sat there.â€

Which is why, when the need to hide treasure had occurred to him, so had thought of the Spaniardâ€™s Cave.

â€œWeâ€™ll bring the last of the gold tonight,â€ he said, â€œand pile rocks to hide the opening up there. Then weâ€™ll leave the seÃ±or here to his rest.â€

I was obliged to admit that the cave made as suitable a resting place as any. And the Spanish soldierâ€™s presence would likely discourage anyone who stumbled on the cave from further investigation, both Indians and settlers having a distinct aversion to ghosts. For that matter, so did Highlanders, and I turned curiously to Jamie.

â€œYou and Jemâ€”you werenâ€™t troubled about being haunted by him?â€

â€œNay, we said the proper prayer for the repose of his soul, when I sealed the cave, and scattered salt around it.â€

That made me smile.

â€œYou know the proper prayer for every occasion, donâ€™t you?â€

He smiled faintly in return, and rubbed the head of the torch in the damp gravel to extinguish it. A faint shaft of light from above glowed on the crown of his head.

â€œThereâ€™s always a prayer, a nighean, even if itâ€™s only A Dhia, cuidich mi.â€ Oh, Godâ€”help me.
