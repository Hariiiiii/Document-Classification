Paris, March 1778

He still didnâ€™t know why the frog hadnâ€™t killed him. Paul Rakoczy, Comte St. Germain, picked up the vial, pulled the cork, and sniffed cautiously, for the third time, but then recorked it, still dissatisfied. Maybe. Maybe not. The scent of the dark-gray powder in the vial held the ghost of something familiarâ€”but it had been thirty years.

He sat for a moment, frowning at the array of jars, bottles, flasks, and pelicans on his workbench. It was late afternoon, and the early spring sun of Paris was like honey, warm and sticky on his face, but glowing in the rounded globes of glass, throwing pools of red and brown and green on the wood from the liquids contained therein. The only discordant note in this peaceful symphony of light was the body of a large rat, lying on its back in the middle of the workbench, a pocket watch open beside it.

The comte put two fingers delicately on the ratâ€™s chest and waited patiently. It didnâ€™t take so long this time; he was used to the coldness as his mind felt its way into the body. Nothing. No hint of light in his mindâ€™s eye, no warm red of a pulsing heart. He glanced at the watch: half an hour.

He took his fingers away, shaking his head.

â€œMÃ©lisande, you evil bitch,â€ he murmured, not without affection. â€œYou didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d try anything you sent me on myself, did you?â€

Still â€¦ he himself had stayed dead a great while longer than half an hour when the frog had given him the dragonâ€™s blood. It had been early evening when he went into Louisâ€™s Star Chamber thirty years before, heart beating with excitement at the coming confrontationâ€”a duel of wizards, with a kingâ€™s favor as the stakesâ€”and one heâ€™d thought heâ€™d win. He remembered the purity of the sky, the beauty of the stars just visible, Venus bright on the horizon, and the joy of it in his blood. Everything always had a greater intensity when you knew life could cease within the next few minutes.

And an hour later he thought his life had ceased, the cup falling from his numbed hand, the coldness rushing through his limbs with amazing speed, freezing the words â€œIâ€™ve lost,â€ an icy core of disbelief in the center of his mind. He hadnâ€™t been looking at the frog; the last thing he had seen through darkening eyes was the womanâ€”La Dame Blancheâ€”her face over the cup sheâ€™d given him appalled and white as bone. But what he recalled, and recalled again now, with the same sense of astonishment and avidity, was the great flare of blue, intense as the color of the evening sky beyond Venus, that had burst from her head and shoulders as he died.

He didnâ€™t recall any feeling of regret or fear, just astonishment. This was nothing, however, to the astonishment heâ€™d felt when he regained his senses, naked on a stone slab in a revolting subterranean chamber next to a drowned corpse. Luckily, there had been no one alive in that disgusting grotto, and he had made his wayâ€”reeling and half blind, clothed in the drowned manâ€™s wet and stinking shirtâ€”out into a dawn more beautiful than any twilight could ever be. Soâ€”ten to twelve hours from the moment of apparent death to revival.

He glanced at the rat, then put out a finger and lifted one of the small, neat paws. Nearly twelve hours. Limp; the rigor had already passed. It was warm up here at the top of the house. Then he turned to the counter that ran along the far wall of the laboratory, where a line of rats lay, possibly insensible, probably dead. He walked slowly along the line, prodding each body. Limp, limp, stiff. Stiff. Stiff. All dead, without doubt. Each had had a smaller dose than the last, but all had diedâ€”though he couldnâ€™t yet be positive about the latest. Wait a bit more, then, to be sure.

He needed to know. Because the Court of Miracles was talking. And they said the frog was back.

The English Channel

They did say that red hair was a sign of the devil. Joan eyed her escortâ€™s fiery locks consideringly. The wind on deck was fierce enough to make her eyes water, and it jerked bits of Michael Murrayâ€™s hair out of its binding so they did dance round his head like flames, a bit. You might expect his face to be ugly as sin if he was one of the devilâ€™s, though, and it wasnâ€™t.

Lucky for him, he looked like his mother in the face, she thought critically. His younger brother, Ian, wasnâ€™t so fortunate, and that without the heathen tattoos. Michaelâ€™s was a fairly pleasant face, for all it was blotched with windburn and the lingering marks of sorrow, and no wonder, him having just lost his father, and his wife dead in France no more than a month before that.

But she wasnâ€™t braving this gale in order to watch Michael Murray, even if he might burst into tears or turn into Auld Horny on the spot. She touched her crucifix for reassurance, just in case. It had been blessed by the priest, and her motherâ€™d carried it all the way to St. Ninianâ€™s Spring and dipped it in the water there, to ask the saintâ€™s protection. And it was her mother she wanted to see, as long as ever she could.

She pulled her kerchief off and waved it, keeping a tight grip lest the wind make off with it. Her mother was growing smaller on the quay, waving madly too, Joey behind her with his arm round her waist to keep her from falling into the water.

Joan snorted a bit at sight of her new stepfather but then thought better and touched the crucifix again, muttering a quick Act of Contrition in penance. After all, it was she herself whoâ€™d made that marriage happen, and a good thing, too. If not, sheâ€™d still be stuck to home at Balriggan, not on her way at last to be a Bride of Christ in France.

A nudge at her elbow made her glance aside, to see Michael offering her a handkerchief. Well, so. If her eyes were streamingâ€”aye, and her noseâ€”it was no wonder, the wind so fierce as it was. She took the scrap of cloth with a curt nod of thanks, scrubbed briefly at her cheeks, and waved her kerchief harder.

None of his family had come to see Michael off, not even his twin sister, Janet. But they were taken up with all there was to do in the wake of Old Ian Murrayâ€™s death, and no wonder. No need to see Michael to the ship, eitherâ€”Michael Murray was a wine merchant in Paris, and a wonderfully well-traveled gentleman. She took some comfort from the knowledge that he knew what to do and where to go and had said he would see her safely delivered to the Convent of Angels, because the thought of making her way through Paris alone and the streets full of people all speaking Frenchâ€”though she knew French quite well, of course. Sheâ€™d been studying it all the winter, and Michaelâ€™s mother helping herâ€”though perhaps she had better not tell the reverend mother about the sorts of French novels Jenny Murray had in her bookshelf, because â€¦

â€œVoulez-vous descendre, mademoiselle?â€

â€œEh?â€ She glanced at him, to see him gesturing toward the hatchway that led downstairs. She turned back, blinkingâ€”but the quay had vanished, and her mother with it.

â€œNo,â€ she said. â€œNot yet. Iâ€™ll just â€¦â€ She wanted to see the land so long as she could. It would be her last sight of Scotland, ever, and the thought made her wame curl into a small, tight ball. She waved a vague hand toward the hatchway. â€œYou go, though. Iâ€™m all right by myself.â€

He didnâ€™t go but came to stand beside her, gripping the rail. She turned away from him a little, so he wouldnâ€™t see her weep, but on the whole she wasnâ€™t sorry heâ€™d stayed.

Neither of them spoke, and the land sank slowly, as though the sea swallowed it, and there was nothing round them now but the open sea, glassy gray and rippling under a scud of clouds. The prospect made her dizzy, and she closed her eyes, swallowing.

Dear Lord Jesus, donâ€™t let me be sick!

A small shuffling noise beside her made her open her eyes, to find Michael Murray regarding her with some concern.

â€œAre ye all right, Miss Joan?â€ He smiled a little. â€œOr should I call ye Sister?â€

â€œNo,â€ she said, taking a grip on her nerve and her stomach and drawing herself up. â€œIâ€™m no a nun yet, am I?â€

He looked her up and down, in the frank way Hieland men did, and smiled more broadly.

â€œHave ye ever seen a nun?â€ he asked.

â€œI have not,â€ she said, as starchily as she could. â€œI havena seen God or the Blessed Virgin, either, but I believe in them, too.â€

Much to her annoyance, he burst out laughing. Seeing the annoyance, though, he stopped at once, though she could see the urge still trembling there behind his assumed gravity.

â€œI do beg your pardon, Miss MacKimmie,â€ he said. â€œI wasna questioning the existence of nuns. Iâ€™ve seen quite a number of the creatures with my own eyes.â€ His lips were twitching, and she glared at him.

â€œCreatures, is it?â€

â€œA figure of speech, nay more, I swear it! Forgive me, Sisterâ€”I ken not what I do!â€ He held up a hand, cowering in mock terror. The urge to laugh made her that much more cross, but she contented herself with a simple â€œmmphmâ€ of disapproval.

Curiosity got the better of her, though, and after a few moments spent inspecting the foaming wake of the ship, she asked, not looking at him, â€œWhen ye saw the nuns, thenâ€”what were they doing?â€

Heâ€™d got control of himself by now and answered her seriously.

â€œWell, I see the Sisters of Notre Dame, who work among the poor all the time in the streets. They always go out by twos, ken, and both nuns will be carrying great huge baskets, filled with food, I supposeâ€”maybe medicines? Theyâ€™re covered, thoughâ€”the basketsâ€”so I canna say for sure whatâ€™s in them. Perhaps theyâ€™re smuggling brandy and lace down to the docksâ€”â€ He dodged aside from her upraised hand, laughing.

â€œOh, yeâ€™ll be a rare nun, Sister Joan! Terror daemonum, solatium miserorum â€¦â€

She pressed her lips tight together, not to laugh. Terror of demonsâ€”the cheek of him!

â€œNot Sister Joan,â€ she said. â€œTheyâ€™ll give me a new name, likely, at the convent.â€

â€œOh, aye?â€ He wiped hair out of his eyes, interested. â€œDâ€™ye get to choose the name yourself?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ she admitted.

â€œWell, thoughâ€”what name would ye pick, if ye had the choosing?â€

â€œEr â€¦ well â€¦â€ She hadnâ€™t told anyone, but, after all, what harm could it do? She wouldnâ€™t see Michael Murray again once they reached Paris. â€œSister Gregory,â€ she blurted.

Rather to her relief, he didnâ€™t laugh.

â€œOh, thatâ€™s a good name,â€ he said. â€œAfter St. Gregory the Great, is it?â€

â€œWell â€¦ aye. Ye donâ€™t think itâ€™s presumptuous?â€ she asked, a little anxious.

â€œOh, no!â€ he said, surprised. â€œI mean, how many nuns are named Mary? If itâ€™s not presumptuous to be named after the mother oâ€™ God, how can it be highfalutin to call yourself after a mere pope?â€ He smiled at that, so merrily that she smiled back.

â€œHow many nuns are named Mary?â€ she asked, out of curiosity. â€œItâ€™s common, is it?â€

â€œOh, aye, ye said yeâ€™d not seen a nun.â€ Heâ€™d stopped making fun of her, though, and answered seriously. â€œAbout half the nuns Iâ€™ve met seem to be called Sister Mary Somethingâ€”ye ken, Sister Mary Polycarp, Sister Mary Joseph â€¦ like that.â€

â€œAnd ye meet a great many nuns in the course oâ€™ your business, do ye?â€ Michael Murray was a wine merchant, the junior partner of Fraser et Cieâ€”and, judging from the cut of his clothes, did well enough at it.

His mouth twitched, but he answered seriously.

â€œWell, I do, really. Not every day, I mean, but the sisters come round to my office quite oftenâ€”or I go to them. Fraser et Cie supplies wine to most oâ€™ the monasteries and convents in Paris, and some will send a pair of nuns to place an order or to take away something specialâ€”otherwise, we deliver it, of course. And even the orders who dinna take wine themselvesâ€”and most of the Parisian houses do, they beinâ€™ French, aye?â€”need sacramental wine for their chapels. And the begging orders come round like clockwork to ask alms.â€

â€œReally.â€ She was fascinated: sufficiently so as to put aside her reluctance to look ignorant. â€œI didna ken â€¦ I mean â€¦ so the different orders do quite different things, is that what yeâ€™re saying? What other kinds are there?â€

He shot her a brief glance but then turned back, narrowing his eyes against the wind as he thought.

â€œWell â€¦ thereâ€™s the sort of nun that prays all the timeâ€”contemplative, I think theyâ€™re called. I see them in the cathedral all hours of the day and night. Thereâ€™s more than one order of that sort, though; one kind wears gray habits and prays in the chapel of St. Joseph, and another wears black; ye see them mostly in the chapel of Our Lady of the Sea.â€ He glanced at her, curious. â€œWill it be that sort of nun that youâ€™ll be?â€

She shook her head, glad that the wind-chafing hid her blushes.

â€œNo,â€ she said, with some regret. â€œThatâ€™s maybe the holiest sort of nun, but Iâ€™ve spent a good bit oâ€™ my life being contemplative on the moors, and I didna like it much. I think I havena got the right sort of soul to do it verra well, even in a chapel.â€

â€œAye,â€ he said, and wiped back flying strands of hair from his face. â€œI ken the moors. The wind gets into your head after a bit.â€ He hesitated for a moment. â€œWhen my uncle Jamieâ€”your da, I meanâ€”ye ken he hid in a cave after Culloden?â€

â€œFor seven years,â€ she said, a little impatient. â€œAye, everyone kens that story. Why?â€

He shrugged.

â€œOnly thinking. I was no but a wee bairn at the time, but I went now and then wiâ€™ my mam, to take him food there. Heâ€™d be glad to see us, but he wouldna talk much. And it scared me to see his eyes.â€

Joan felt a small shiver pass down her back, nothing to do with the stiff breeze. She sawâ€”suddenly saw, in her headâ€”a thin, dirty man, the bones starting in his face, crouched in the dank, frozen shadows of the cave.

â€œDa?â€ she scoffed, to hide the shiver that crawled up her arms. â€œHow could anyone be scairt of him? Heâ€™s a dear, kind man.â€

Michaelâ€™s wide mouth twitched at the corners.

â€œI suppose it would depend whether yeâ€™d ever seen him in a fight. Butâ€”â€

â€œHave you?â€ she interrupted, curious. â€œSeen him in a fight?â€

â€œI have, aye. BUTâ€”â€ he said, not willing to be distracted, â€œI didna mean he scared me. It was that I thought he was haunted. By the voices in the wind.â€

That dried up the spit in her mouth, and she worked her tongue a little, hoping it didnâ€™t show. She neednâ€™t have worried; he wasnâ€™t looking at her.

â€œMy own da said it was because Jamie spent so much time alone, that the voices got into his head and he couldna stop hearing them. When heâ€™d feel safe enough to come to the house, it would take hours sometimes before he could start to hear us againâ€”Mam wouldna let us talk to him until heâ€™d had something to eat and was warmed through.â€ He smiled, a little ruefully. â€œShe said he wasna human â€™til thenâ€”and, looking back, I dinna think she meant that as a figure of speech.â€

â€œWell,â€ she said, but stopped, not knowing how to go on. She wished fervently that sheâ€™d known this earlier. Her da and his sister were coming on to France later, but she might not see him. She could maybe have talked to Da, asked him just what the voices in his head were likeâ€”what they said. Whether they were anything like the ones she heard.

* * *

Nearly twilight, and the rats were still dead. The comte heard the bells of Notre Dame calling sept and glanced at his pocket watch. The bells were two minutes before their time, and he frowned. He didnâ€™t like sloppiness. He stood up and stretched himself, groaning as his spine cracked like the ragged volley of a firing squad. No doubt about it, he was aging, and the thought sent a chill through him.

If. If he could find the way forward, then perhaps â€¦ but you never knew, that was the devil of it. For a little while, heâ€™d thoughtâ€”hopedâ€”that traveling back in time stopped the process of aging. That initially seemed logical, like rewinding a clock. But, then again, it wasnâ€™t logical, because heâ€™d always gone back farther than his own lifetime. Only once heâ€™d tried to go back just a few years, to his early twenties. That was a mistake, and he still shivered at the memory.

He went to the tall gabled window that looked out over the Seine.

That particular view of the river had changed barely at all in the last two hundred years; heâ€™d seen it at several different times. He hadnâ€™t always owned this house, but it had stood in this street since 1620, and he always managed to get in briefly, if only to reestablish his own sense of reality after a passage.

Only the trees changed in his view of the river, and sometimes a strange-looking boat would be there. But the rest was always the same and no doubt always would be: the old fishermen, catching their supper off the landing in stubborn silence, each guarding his space with outthrust elbows, the younger ones, barefoot and slump-shouldered with exhaustion, laying out their nets to dry, naked little boys diving off the quay. It gave him a soothing sense of eternity, watching the river. Perhaps it didnâ€™t matter so much if he must one day die?

â€œThe devil it doesnâ€™t,â€ he murmured to himself, and glanced up at the sky. Venus shone bright. He should go.

Pausing conscientiously to place his fingers on each ratâ€™s body and ensure that no spark of life remained, he passed down the line, then swept them all into a burlap bag. If he was going to the Court of Miracles, at least he wouldnâ€™t arrive empty-handed.

* * *

Joan was still reluctant to go below, but the light was fading, the wind getting up regardless, and a particularly spiteful gust that blew her petticoats right up round her waist and grabbed her arse with a chilly hand made her yelp in a very undignified way. She smoothed her skirts hastily and made for the hatchway, followed by Michael Murray.

Seeing him cough and chafe his hands at the bottom of the ladder made her sorry; here sheâ€™d kept him freezing on deck, too polite to go below and leave her to her own devices, and her too selfish to see he was cold, the poor man. She made a hasty knot in her handkerchief, to remind her to say an extra decade of the rosary for penance, when she got to it.

He saw her to a bench and said a few words to the woman sitting next to her, in French. Obviously he was introducing her, she understood that muchâ€”but when the woman nodded and said something in reply, she could only sit there openmouthed. She didnâ€™t understand a word. Not a word!

Michael evidently grasped the situation, for he said something to the womanâ€™s husband, which drew her attention away from Joan, and engaged them in a conversation that let Joan sink quietly back against the wooden wall of the ship, sweating with embarrassment.

Well, sheâ€™d get into the way of it, she reassured herself. Bound to. She settled herself with determination to listen, picking out the odd word here and there in the conversation. It was easier to understand Michael; he spoke slower and didnâ€™t swallow the back half of each word.

She was trying to puzzle out the probable spelling of a word that sounded like â€œpwufgweemiarniereâ€ but surely couldnâ€™t be, when her eye caught a slight movement from the bench opposite, and the gurgling vowels caught in her throat.

A man sat there, maybe close to her own age, which was twenty-five. He was good-looking, if a bit thin in the face, decently dressedâ€”and he was going to die.

There was a gray shroud over him, the same as if he were wrapped in mist, so his face showed through it. Sheâ€™d seen that same thingâ€”the grayness lying on someoneâ€™s face like fogâ€”seen it twice before and knew it at once for deathâ€™s shadow. Once it had been on an elderly man, and that might have been only what anybody could see, because Angus MacWheen was ill, but then again, and only a few weeks after, sheâ€™d seen it on the second of Vhairi Fraserâ€™s little boys, and him a rosy-faced wee bairn with dear chubby legs.

She hadnâ€™t wanted to believe it. Either that she saw it or what it meant. But four days later, the wean was crushed in the lane by an ox that was maddened by a hornetâ€™s sting. Sheâ€™d vomited when they told her, and couldnâ€™t eat for days after, for sheer grief and terror. Because could she have stopped it if sheâ€™d said? And whatâ€”dear Lord, whatâ€”if it happened again?

Now it had, and her wame twisted. She leapt to her feet and blundered toward the companionway, cutting short some slowly worded speech from the Frenchman.

Not again, not again! she thought in agony. Why show me such things? What can I do?

She pawed frantically at the ladder, climbing as fast as she could, gasping for air, needing to be away from the dying man. How long might it be, dear Lord, until she reached the convent, and safety?

* * *

The moon was rising over the ÃŽle de la CitÃ©, glowing through the haze of cloud. He glanced at it, estimating the time; no point in arriving at Madame Fabienneâ€™s house before the girls had taken their hair out of curling papers and rolled on their red stockings. There were other places to go first, though: the obscure drinking places where the professionals of the court fortified themselves for the night ahead. One of those was where he had first heard the rumorsâ€”heâ€™d see how far they had spread and would judge the safety of asking openly about MaÃ®tre Raymond.

That was one advantage to hiding in the past, rather than going to Hungary or Swedenâ€”life at this court tended to be short, and there were not so many who knew either his face or his history, though there would still be stories. Paris held on to its histoires. He found the iron gateâ€”rustier than it had been; it left red stains on his palmâ€”and pushed it open with a creak that would alert whatever now lived at the end of the alley.

He had to see the frog. Not meet him, perhapsâ€”he made a brief sign against evilâ€”but see him. Above all else, he needed to know: had the manâ€”if he was a manâ€”aged?

â€œCertainly heâ€™s a man,â€ he muttered to himself, impatient. â€œWhat else could he be, for heavenâ€™s sake?â€

He could be something like you, was the answering thought, and a shiver ran up his spine. Fear? He wondered. Anticipation of an intriguing philosophical mystery? Or possibly â€¦ hope?

* * *

â€œWhat a waste of a wonderful arse,â€ Monsieur Brechin remarked in French, watching Joanâ€™s ascent from the far side of the cabin. â€œAnd, mon Dieu, those legs! Imagine those wrapped around your back, eh? Would you have her keep the striped stockings on? I would.â€

It hadnâ€™t occurred to Michael to imagine that, but he was now having a hard time dismissing the image. He coughed into his handkerchief to hide the reddening of his face.

Madame Brechin gave her husband a sharp elbow in the ribs. He grunted but seemed undisturbed by what was evidently a normal form of marital communication.

â€œBeast,â€ she said, with no apparent heat. â€œSpeaking so of a Bride of Christ. You will be lucky if God himself doesnâ€™t strike you dead with a lightning bolt.â€

â€œWell, she isnâ€™t his bride yet,â€ Monsieur protested. â€œAnd who created that arse in the first place? Surely God would be flattered to hear a little sincere appreciation of his handiwork. From one who is, after all, a connoisseur in such matters.â€ He leered affectionately at Madame, who snorted.

A faint snigger from the young man across the cabin indicated that Monsieur was not alone in his appreciation, and Madame turned a reproving glare on the young man. Michael wiped his nose carefully, trying not to catch Monsieurâ€™s eye. His insides were quivering, and not entirely from either amusement or the shock of inadvertent lust. He felt very queer.

Monsieur sighed as Joanâ€™s striped stockings disappeared through the hatchway.

â€œChrist will not warm her bed,â€ he said, shaking his head.

â€œChrist will not fart in her bed, either,â€ said Madame, taking out her knitting.

â€œPardonnez-moi â€¦â€ Michael said in a strangled voice, and, clapping his handkerchief to his mouth, made hastily for the ladder, as though seasickness might be catching.

It wasnâ€™t mal de mer that was surging up from his belly, though. He caught sight of Joan, dim in the evening light at the rail, and turned quickly, going to the other side, where he gripped the rail as though it were a life raft and let the overwhelming waves of grief wash through him. It was the only way heâ€™d been able to manage, these last few weeks. Hold on as long as he could, keeping a cheerful face, until some small unexpected thing, some bit of emotional debris, struck him through the heart like a hunterâ€™s arrow, and then hurry to find a place to hide, curling up in mindless pain until he could get a grip of himself.

This time, it was Madameâ€™s remark that had come out of the blue, and he grimaced painfully, laughing in spite of the tears that poured down his face, remembering Lillie. Sheâ€™d eaten eels in garlic sauce for dinnerâ€”those always made her fart with a silent deadliness like poison swamp gas. As the ghastly miasma had risen up round him, heâ€™d sat bolt upright in bed, only to find her staring at him, a look of indignant horror on her face.

â€œHow dare you?â€ sheâ€™d said, in a voice of offended majesty. â€œReally, Michel.â€

â€œYou know it wasnâ€™t me!â€

Her mouth had dropped open, outrage added to horror and distaste.

â€œOh!â€ she gasped, gathering her pug-dog to her bosom. â€œYou not only fart like a rotting whale, you attempt to blame it on my poor puppy! Cochon!â€ Whereupon she had begun to shake the bedsheets delicately, using her free hand to waft the noxious odors in his direction, addressing censorious remarks to Plonplon, who gave Michael a sanctimonious look before turning to lick his mistressâ€™s face with great enthusiasm.

â€œOh, Jesus,â€ he whispered, and, sinking down, pressed his face against the rail. â€œOh, God, lass, I love you!â€

He shook silently, head buried in his arms, aware of sailors passing now and then behind him, but none of them took notice of him in the dark. At last the agony eased a little, and he drew breath.

All right, then. Heâ€™d be all right now, for a time. And he thanked God, belatedly, that he had Joanâ€”or Sister Gregory, if she likedâ€”to look after for a bit. He didnâ€™t know how heâ€™d manage to walk through the streets of Paris to his house, alone. Go in, greet the servantsâ€”would Jared be there?â€”face the sorrow of the household, accept their sympathy for his fatherâ€™s death, order a meal, sit down â€¦ and all the time wanting just to throw himself on the floor of their empty bedroom and howl like a lost soul. Heâ€™d have to face it, sooner or laterâ€”but not just yet. And right now heâ€™d take the grace of any respite that was offered.

He blew his nose with resolution, tucked away his mangled handkerchief, and went downstairs to fetch the basket his mother had sent. He couldnâ€™t swallow a thing himself, but feeding Joan would maybe keep his mind off things for that one minute more.

â€œThatâ€™s how ye do it,â€ his brother Ian had told him, as they leant together on the rail of their motherâ€™s sheep pen, the winterâ€™s wind cold on their faces, waiting for their da to find his way through dying. â€œYe find a way to live for that one more minute. And then another. And another.â€ Ian had lost a wife, too, and knew.

Heâ€™d wiped his faceâ€”he could weep before Ian, while he couldnâ€™t with his elder brother or the girls, certainly not in front of his motherâ€”and asked, â€œAnd it gets better after a time, is that what yeâ€™re telling me?â€

His brother had looked at him straight on, the quiet in his eyes showing through the outlandish Mohawk tattoos.

â€œNo,â€ heâ€™d said softly. â€œBut after a time, ye find yeâ€™re in a different place than ye were. A different person than ye were. And then ye look about and see whatâ€™s there with ye. Yeâ€™ll maybe find a use for yourself. That helps.â€

â€œAye, fine,â€ he said, under his breath, and squared his shoulders. â€œWeâ€™ll see, then.â€

* * *

To Rakoczyâ€™s surprise, there was a familiar face behind the rough bar. If Maximilian the Great was surprised to see him, the Spanish dwarf gave no indication of it. The other drinkersâ€”a pair of jugglers, each missing an arm (but the opposing arm), a toothless hag who smacked and muttered over her mug of arrack, and something that looked like a ten-year-old girl but almost certainly wasnâ€™tâ€”turned to stare at him but, seeing nothing remarkable in his shabby clothing and burlap bag, turned back to the business of getting sufficiently drunk as to do what needed to be done tonight.

He nodded to Max and pulled up one of the splintering kegs to sit on.

â€œWhatâ€™s your pleasure, seÃ±or?â€

Rakoczy narrowed his eyes; Max had never served anything but arrack. But times had changed; there was a stone bottle of something that might be beer and a dark glass bottle with a chalk scrawl on it, standing next to the keg of rough brandy.

â€œArrack, please, Max,â€ he saidâ€”better the devil you knowâ€”and was surprised to see the dwarfâ€™s eyes narrow in return.

â€œYou knew my honored father, I see, seÃ±or,â€ the dwarf said, putting the cup on the board. â€œItâ€™s some time since youâ€™ve been in Paris?â€

â€œPardonnez,â€ Rakoczy said, accepting it and tossing it back. If you could afford more than one cup, you didnâ€™t let it linger on the tongue. â€œYour honored â€¦ late father? Max?â€

â€œMaximiliano el Maximo,â€ the dwarf corrected him firmly.

â€œTo be sure.â€ Rakoczy gestured for another drink. â€œAnd whom have I the honor to address?â€

The Spaniardâ€”though perhaps his accent wasnâ€™t as strong as Maxâ€™s had beenâ€”drew himself up proudly. â€œMaxim Le Grand, a su servicio!â€

Rakoczy saluted him gravely and threw back the second cup, motioning for a third and, with a gesture, inviting Maxim to join him.

â€œIt has been some time since I was last here,â€ he said. No lie there. â€œI wonder if another old acquaintance might be still aliveâ€”MaÃ®tre Raymond, otherwise called the Frog?â€

There was a tiny quiver in the air, a barely perceptible flicker of attention, gone almost as soon as heâ€™d sensed itâ€”somewhere behind him?

â€œA frog,â€ Maxim said, meditatively pouring himself a drink. â€œI donâ€™t know any frogs myself, but should I hear of one, who shall I say is asking for him?â€

Should he give his name? No, not yet.

â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter,â€ he said. â€œBut word can be left with Madame Fabienne. You know the place? In the Rue Antoine?â€

The dwarfâ€™s sketchy brows rose, and his mouth turned up at one corner.

â€œI know it.â€

Doubtless he did, Rakoczy thought. â€œEl Maximoâ€ hadnâ€™t referred to Maxâ€™s stature, and probably â€œLe Grandâ€ didnâ€™t, either. God had a sense of justice, as well as a sense of humor.

â€œBon.â€ He wiped his lips on his sleeve and put down a coin that would have bought the whole keg. â€œMerci.â€

He stood up, the hot taste of the brandy bubbling at the back of his throat, and belched. Two more places to visit, maybe, before he went to Fabienneâ€™s. He couldnâ€™t visit more than that and stay upright; he was getting old.

â€œGood night.â€ He bowed to the company and gingerly pushed open the cracked wooden door; it was hanging by one leather hinge, and that looked ready to give way at any moment.

â€œRibbit,â€ someone said very softly, just before the door closed behind him.

* * *

Madeleineâ€™s face lighted when she saw him, and his heart warmed. She wasnâ€™t very bright, poor creature, but she was pretty and amiable and had been a whore long enough to be grateful for small kindnesses.

â€œMonsieur Rakoczy!â€ She flung her arms about his neck, nuzzling affectionately.

â€œMadeleine, my dear.â€ He cupped her chin and kissed her gently on the lips, drawing her close so that her belly pressed against his. He held her long enough, kissing her eyelids, her forehead, her earsâ€”so that she made high squeaks of pleasureâ€”that he could feel his way inside her, hold the weight of her womb in his mind, evaluate her ripening.

It felt warm, the color in the heart of a dark crimson rose, the kind called sang de dragon. A week before, it had felt solid, compact as a folded fist; now it had begun to soften, to hollow slightly as she readied. Three more days? he wondered. Four?

He let her go, and when she pouted prettily at him, he laughed and raised her hand to his lips, feeling the same small thrill he had felt when he first found her, as the faint blue glow rose between her fingers in response to his touch. She couldnâ€™t see itâ€”heâ€™d raised their linked hands to her face before and she had merely looked puzzledâ€”but it was there.

â€œGo and fetch some wine, ma belle,â€ he said, squeezing her hand gently. â€œI need to talk to Madame.â€

Madame Fabienne was not a dwarf, but she was small, brown, and mottled as a toadstoolâ€”and as watchful as a toad, round yellow eyes seldom blinking, never closed.

â€œMonsieur le Comte,â€ she said graciously, nodding him to a damask chair in her salon. The air was scented with candle wax and fleshâ€”flesh of a far better quality than that on offer in the court. Even so, Madame had come from that court and kept her connections there alive; she made no bones about that. She didnâ€™t blink at his clothes, but her nostrils flared at him, as though she picked up the scent of the dives and alleys he had come from.

â€œGood evening, Madame,â€ he said, smiling at her, and lifted the burlap bag. â€œI brought a small present for Leopold. If heâ€™s awake?â€

â€œAwake and cranky,â€ she said, eyeing the bag with interest. â€œHeâ€™s just shed his skinâ€”you donâ€™t want to make any sudden moves.â€

Leopold was a remarkably handsomeâ€”and remarkably largeâ€”python; an albino, quite rare. Opinion of his origins was divided; half of Madame Fabienneâ€™s clientele held that she had been given the snake by a noble clientâ€”some said the late King himselfâ€”whom she had cured of impotence. Others said the snake had once been a noble client, who had refused to pay her for services rendered. Rakoczy had his own opinions on that one, but he liked Leopold, who was ordinarily tame as a cat and would sometimes come when calledâ€”as long as you had something he regarded as food in your hand when you called.

â€œLeopold! Monsieur le Comte has brought you a treat!â€ Fabienne reached across to an enormous wicker cage and flicked the door opened, withdrawing her hand with sufficient speed as to indicate just what she meant by â€œcranky.â€

Almost at once, a huge yellow head poked out into the light. Snakes had transparent eyelids, but Rakoczy could swear the python blinked irritably, swaying up a coil of its monstrous body for a moment before plunging out of the cage and swarming across the floor with amazing rapidity for such a big creature, tongue flicking in and out like a seamstressâ€™s needle.

He made straight for Rakoczy, jaws yawning as he came, and Rakoczy snatched up the bag just before Leopold tried to engulf itâ€”or Rakoczyâ€”whole. He jerked aside, hastily seized a rat, and threw it. Leopold flung a coil of his body on top of the rat with a thud that rattled Madameâ€™s spoon in her teabowl, and before the company could blink, he had whipped the rat into a half-hitch knot of coil.

â€œHungry as well as ill-tempered, I see,â€ Rakoczy remarked, trying for nonchalance. In fact, the hairs were prickling over his neck and arms. Normally, Leopold took his time about feeding, and the violence of the pythonâ€™s appetite at such close quarters had shaken him.

Fabienne was laughing, almost silently, her tiny sloping shoulders quivering beneath the green Chinese silk tunic she wore.

â€œI thought for an instant heâ€™d have you,â€ she remarked at last, wiping her eyes. â€œIf he had, I shouldnâ€™t have had to feed him for a month!â€

Rakoczy bared his teeth in an expression that might have been taken for a smile.

â€œWe cannot let Leopold go hungry,â€ he said. â€œI wish to make a special arrangement for Madeleineâ€”it should keep the worm up to his yellow arse in rats for some time.â€

Fabienne put down her handkerchief and regarded him with interest.

â€œLeopold has two cocks, but I canâ€™t say Iâ€™ve ever noticed an arse. Twenty Ã©cus a day. Plus two extra if she needs clothes.â€

He waved an easy hand, dismissing this.

â€œI had in mind something longer.â€ He explained what he had in mind and had the satisfaction of seeing Fabienneâ€™s face go quite blank with stupefaction. It didnâ€™t stay that way more than a few moments; by the time he had finished, she was already laying out her initial demands.

When they finally came to agreement, they had drunk half a bottle of decent wine, and Leopold had swallowed the rat. It made a small bulge in the muscular tube of the snakeâ€™s body but hadnâ€™t slowed him appreciably; the coils slithered restlessly over the painted canvas floorcloth, glowing like gold, and Rakoczy saw the patterns of his skin like trapped clouds beneath the scales.

â€œHe is beautiful, no?â€ Fabienne saw his admiration and basked a little in it. â€œDid I ever tell you where I got him?â€

â€œYes, more than once. And more than one story, too.â€ She looked startled, and he compressed his lips. Heâ€™d been patronizing her establishment for no more than a few weeks, this time. Heâ€™d known her fifteen years beforeâ€”though only a couple of months, that time. He hadnâ€™t given his name then, and a madam saw so many men that there was little chance of her recalling him. On the other hand, he also thought it unlikely that she troubled to recall to whom sheâ€™d told which story, and this seemed to be the case, for she lifted one shoulder in a surprisingly graceful shrug and laughed.

â€œYes, but this one is true.â€

â€œOh, well, then.â€ He smiled and, reaching into the bag, tossed Leopold another rat. The snake moved more slowly this time and didnâ€™t bother to constrict its motionless prey, merely unhinging its jaw and engulfing it in a single-minded way.

â€œHe is an old friend, Leopold,â€ she said, gazing affectionately at the snake. â€œI brought him with me from the West Indies, many years ago. He is a MystÃ¨re, you know.â€

â€œI didnâ€™t, no.â€ Rakoczy drank more wine; he had sat long enough that he was beginning to feel almost sober again. â€œAnd what is that?â€ He was interestedâ€”not so much in the snake but in Fabienneâ€™s mention of the West Indies. Heâ€™d forgotten that she claimed to have come from there, many years ago, long before heâ€™d known her the first time.

The afile powder had been waiting in his laboratory when heâ€™d come back; no telling how many years it had sat thereâ€”the servants couldnâ€™t recall. MÃ©lisandeâ€™s brief noteâ€”Try this. It may be what the frog usedâ€”had not been dated, but there was a brief scrawl at the top of the sheet, saying, Rose Hall, Jamaica. If Fabienne retained any connections in the West Indies, perhaps â€¦

â€œSome call them loaâ€â€”her wrinkled lips pursed as she kissed the wordâ€”â€œbut those are the Africans. A MystÃ¨re is a spirit, one who is an intermediary between the Bondye and us. Bondye is le bon Dieu, of course,â€ she explained to him. â€œThe African slaves speak very bad French. Give him another rat; heâ€™s still hungry, and it scares the girls if I let him hunt in the house.â€

Another two rats and the snake was beginning to look like a fat string of pearls he was showing an inclination to lie still, digesting. The tongue still flickered, tasting the air, but lazily now.

Rakoczy picked up the bag again, weighing the risksâ€”but, after all, if news came from the Court of Miracles, his name would soon be known in any case.

â€œI wonder, Madame, as you know everyone in Parisâ€â€”he gave her a small bow, which she graciously returnedâ€”â€œare you acquainted with a certain man known as MaÃ®tre Raymond? Some call him the frog,â€ he added.

She blinked, then looked amused.

â€œYouâ€™re looking for the frog?â€

â€œYes. Is that funny?â€ He reached into the sack, fishing for a rat.

â€œSomewhat. I should perhaps not tell you, but since you are so accommodatingâ€â€”she glanced complacently at the purse he had put beside her teabowl, a generous deposit on accountâ€”â€œMaÃ®tre Grenouille is looking for you.â€

He stopped dead, hand clutching a furry body.

â€œWhat? Youâ€™ve seen him?â€

She shook her head and, sniffing distastefully at her cold tea, rang the bell for her maid.

â€œNo, but Iâ€™ve heard the same from two people.â€

â€œAsking for me by name?â€ Rakoczyâ€™s heart beat faster.

â€œMonsieur le Comte St. Germain. That is you?â€ She asked with no more than mild interest; false names were common in her business.

He nodded, mouth suddenly too dry to speak, and pulled the rat from the sack. It squirmed suddenly in his hand, and a piercing pain in his thumb made him hurl the rodent away.

â€œSacrebleu! It bit me!â€

The rat, dazed by impact, staggered drunkenly across the floor toward Leopold, whose tongue began to flicker faster. Fabienne, though, uttered a sound of disgust and threw a silver-backed hairbrush at the rat. Startled by the clatter, the rat leapt convulsively into the air, landed on and raced directly over the snakeâ€™s astonished head, disappearing through the door into the foyer, whereâ€”by the resultant screamâ€”it evidently encountered the maid before making its ultimate escape into the street.

â€œJÃ©sus Marie,â€ Madame Fabienne said, piously crossing herself. â€œA miraculous resurrection. Two weeks before Easter, too.â€

* * *

It was a smooth passage; the shore of France came into sight just after dawn the next day. Joan saw it, a low smudge of dark green on the horizon, and felt a little thrill at the sight, in spite of her tiredness.

She hadnâ€™t slept, though sheâ€™d reluctantly gone below after nightfall, there to wrap herself in her cloak and shawl, trying not to look at the young man with the shadow on his face. Sheâ€™d lain all night, listening to the snores and groans of her fellow passengers, praying doggedly and wondering in despair whether prayer was all she could do.

She often wondered whether it was because of her name. Sheâ€™d been proud of her name when she was small; it was a heroic name, a saintâ€™s name, but also a warriorâ€™s name. Her motherâ€™d told her that, often and often. She didnâ€™t think her mother had considered that the name might also be haunted.

Surely it didnâ€™t happen to everyone named Joan, though, did it? She wished she knew another Joan to ask. Because if it did happen to them all, the others would be keeping it quiet, just as she did.

You didnâ€™t go round telling people that you heard voices that werenâ€™t there. Still less that you saw things that werenâ€™t there, either. You just didnâ€™t.

Sheâ€™d heard of a seer, of course; everyone in the Highlands had. And nearly everyone she knew at least claimed to have seen the odd fetch or had a premonition that Angus MacWheen was dead when he didnâ€™t come home that time last winter. The fact that Angus MacWheen was a filthy auld drunkard and so yellow and crazed that it was heads or tails whether heâ€™d die on any particular day, let alone when it got cold enough that the loch froze, didnâ€™t come into it.

But sheâ€™d never met a seerâ€”there was the rub. How did you get into the way of it? Did you just tell folk, â€œHereâ€™s a thing â€¦ Iâ€™m a seer,â€ and theyâ€™d nod and say, â€œOh, aye, of course; whatâ€™s like to happen to me next Tuesday?â€ More important, though, how the devilâ€”

â€œOw!â€ Sheâ€™d bitten her tongue fiercely as penance for the inadvertent blasphemy, and clapped a hand to her mouth.

â€œWhat is it?â€ said a concerned voice behind her. â€œAre ye hurt, Miss MacKimmie? Er â€¦ Sister Gregory, I mean?â€

â€œMm! No. No, I jutht â€¦ bit my tongue.â€ She turned to Michael Murray, gingerly touching the injured tongue to the roof of her mouth.

â€œWell, that happens when ye talk to yourself.â€ He took the cork from a bottle he was carrying and held the bottle out to her. â€œHere, wash your mouth wiâ€™ that; itâ€™ll help.â€

She took a large mouthful and swirled it round; it burned the bitten place, but not badly, and she swallowed, as slowly as possible, to make it last.

â€œJesus, Mary, and Bride,â€ she breathed. â€œIs that wine?â€ The taste in her mouth bore some faint kinship with the liquid she knew as wineâ€”just as apples bore some resemblance to horse turds.

â€œAye, it is pretty good,â€ he said modestly. â€œGerman. Umm â€¦ have a wee nip more?â€

She didnâ€™t argue and sipped happily, barely listening to his talk, telling about the wine, what it was called, how they made it in Germany, where he got it â€¦ on and on. Finally she came to herself enough to remember her manners, though, and reluctantly handed back the bottle, now half empty.

â€œI thank ye, sir,â€ she said primly. â€œ â€™Twas kind of ye. Ye needna waste your time in bearing me company, though; I shall be well enough alone.â€

â€œAye, well â€¦ itâ€™s no really for your sake,â€ he said, and took a reasonable swallow himself. â€œItâ€™s for mine.â€

She blinked against the wind. He was flushed, but not from drink or wind, she thought.

She managed a faint interrogative â€œAh â€¦?â€

â€œWell, what I want to ask,â€ he blurted, and looked away, cheekbones burning red. â€œWill ye pray for me? Sister? And myâ€”my wife. The repose ofâ€”ofâ€”â€

â€œOh!â€ she said, mortified that sheâ€™d been so taken up with her own worries as not to have seen his distress. Think youâ€™re a seer, dear Lord, ye dinna see whatâ€™s under your neb; youâ€™re no but a fool, and a selfish fool at that. She put her hand over his where it lay on the rail and squeezed tight, trying to channel some sense of Godâ€™s goodness into his flesh. â€œTo be sure I will!â€ she said. â€œIâ€™ll remember ye at every Mass, I swear it!â€ She wondered briefly whether it was proper to swear to something like that, but after all â€¦ â€œAnd your poor wifeâ€™s soul, of course I will! What â€¦ er â€¦ what was her name? So as Iâ€™ll know what to say when I pray for her,â€ she explained hurriedly, seeing his eyes narrow with pain.

â€œLilliane,â€ he said, so softly that she barely heard him over the wind. â€œI called her Lillie.â€

â€œLilliane,â€ she repeated carefully, trying to form the syllables like he did. It was a soft, lovely name, she thought, slipping like water over the rocks at the top of a burn. Youâ€™ll never see a burn again, she thought with a pang, but dismissed this, turning her face toward the growing shore of France. â€œIâ€™ll remember.â€

He nodded in mute thanks, and they stood for some little while, until she realized that her hand was still resting on his and drew it back with a jerk. He looked startled, and she blurtedâ€”because it was the thing on the top of her mindâ€”â€œWhat was she like? Your wife?â€

The most extraordinary mix of emotions flooded over his face. She couldnâ€™t have said what was uppermostâ€”grief, laughter, or sheer bewildermentâ€”and she realized suddenly just how little of his true mind sheâ€™d seen before.

â€œShe was â€¦â€ He shrugged and swallowed. â€œShe was my wife,â€ he said, very softly. â€œShe was my life.â€

She should know something comforting to say to him, but she didnâ€™t.

Sheâ€™s with God? That was the truth, she hoped, and yet clearly to this young man, the only thing that mattered was that his wife was not with him.

â€œWhat happened to her?â€ she asked instead, baldly, only because it seemed necessary to say something.

He took a deep breath and appeared to sway a little; heâ€™d finished the rest of the wine, she saw, and she took the empty bottle from his hand, tossing it overboard.

â€œThe influenza. They said it was quick. Didnâ€™t feel quick to meâ€”and yet, it was, I suppose it was. It took two days, and God kens well that I recall every second of those daysâ€”yet it seems that I lost her between one heartbeat and the next. And Iâ€”I keep lookinâ€™ for her there, in that space between.â€

He swallowed. â€œSheâ€”she was â€¦â€ The words â€œwith childâ€ came so quietly that she barely heard them.

â€œOh,â€ Joan said softly, very moved. â€œOh, a chuisle.â€ â€œHeartâ€™s blood,â€ it meant, and what she meant was that his wife had been that to himâ€”dear Lord, she hoped he hadnâ€™t thought she meantâ€”no, he hadnâ€™t, and the tight-wound spring in her backbone relaxed a little, seeing the look of gratitude on his face. He did know what sheâ€™d meant and seemed glad that sheâ€™d understood.

Blinking, she looked awayâ€”and caught sight of the young man with the shadow on him, leaning against the railing a little way down. The breath caught in her throat at sight of him.

The shadow was darker in the morning light. The sun was beginning to warm the deck, frail white clouds swam in the blue of clear French skies, and yet the mist now swirled and thickened, obscuring the young manâ€™s face, wrapping round his shoulders like a shawl.

Dear Lord, tell me what to do! Her body jerked, wanting to go to the young man, speak to him. But to say what? â€œYouâ€™re in danger, be carefulâ€? Heâ€™d think she was mad. And if the danger was a thing he couldnâ€™t help, like with wee Ronnie and the ox, what difference might her speaking make?

She was dimly aware of Michael staring at her, curious. He said something to her, but she wasnâ€™t listening, listening hard instead inside her head. Where were the damned voices when you bloody needed one?

But the voices were stubbornly silent, and she turned to Michael, the muscles of her arm jumping, sheâ€™d held so tight to the shipâ€™s rigging.

â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ she said. â€œI wasna listening properly. I justâ€”thought of something.â€

â€œIf itâ€™s a thing I can help ye with, Sister, yeâ€™ve only to ask,â€ he said, smiling faintly. â€œOh! And speak of that, I meant to sayâ€”I said to your mam, if she liked to write to you in care of Fraser et Cie, Iâ€™d see to it that ye got the letters.â€ He shrugged, one-shouldered. â€œI dinna ken what the rules are at the convent, aye? About getting letters from outside.â€

Joan didnâ€™t know that, either, and had worried about it. She was so relieved to hear this that a huge smile split her face.

â€œOh, itâ€™s that kind of ye!â€ she said. â€œAnd if I couldâ€”maybe write back â€¦?â€

His smile grew wider, the marks of grief easing in his pleasure at doing her a service.

â€œAnytime,â€ he assured her. â€œIâ€™ll see to it. Perhaps I couldâ€”â€

A ragged shriek cut through the air, and Joan glanced up, startled, thinking it one of the seabirds that had come out from shore to wheel round the ship, but it wasnâ€™t. The young man was standing on the rail, one hand on the rigging, and before she could so much as draw breath, he let go and was gone.





Paris

Michael was worried for Joan; she sat slumped in the coach, not bothering to look out of the window, until a faint waft of the cool breeze touched her face. The smell was so astonishing that it drew her out of the shell of shocked misery in which she had traveled from the docks.

â€œMother oâ€™ God!â€ she said, clapping a hand to her nose. â€œWhat is that?â€

Michael dug in his pocket and pulled out the grubby rag of his handkerchief, looking dubiously at it.

â€œItâ€™s the public cemeteries. Iâ€™m sorry, I didna thinkâ€”â€

â€œMoran taing.â€ She seized the damp cloth from him and held it over her face, not caring. â€œDo the French not bury folk in their cemeteries?â€ Because, judging from the smell, a thousand corpses had been thrown out on wet ground and left to rot, and the sight of darting, squabbling flocks of black corbies in the distance did nothing to correct this impression.

â€œThey do.â€ Michael felt exhaustedâ€”it had been a terrible morningâ€”but struggled to pull himself together. â€œItâ€™s all marshland over there, though; even coffins buried deepâ€”and most of them arenâ€™tâ€”work their way through the ground in a few months. When thereâ€™s a floodâ€”and thereâ€™s a flood whenever it rainsâ€”whatâ€™s left of the coffins falls apart, and â€¦â€ He swallowed, just as pleased that heâ€™d not eaten any breakfast.

â€œThereâ€™s talk of maybe moving the bones at least, putting them in an ossuary, they call it. There are mine workings, old ones, outside the cityâ€”over thereâ€â€”he pointed with his chinâ€”â€œand perhaps â€¦ but they havena done anything about it yet,â€ he added in a rush, pinching his nose fast to get a breath in through his mouth. It didnâ€™t matter whether you breathed through your nose or your mouth, though; the air was thick enough to taste.

She looked as ill as he felt, or maybe worse, her face the color of spoilt custard. Sheâ€™d vomited when the crew had finally pulled the suicide aboard, pouring gray water and slimed with the seaweed that had wrapped round his legs and drowned him. There were still traces of sick down her front, and her dark hair was lank and damp, straggling out from under her cap. She hadnâ€™t slept at all, of courseâ€”neither had he.

He couldnâ€™t take her to the convent in this condition. The nuns maybe wouldnâ€™t mind, but she would. He stretched up and rapped on the ceiling of the carriage.

â€œMonsieur?â€

â€œAu chÃ¢teau, vite!â€

Heâ€™d take her to his house first. It wasnâ€™t much out of the way, and the convent wasnâ€™t expecting her at any particular day or hour. She could wash, have something to eat, and put herself to rights. And if it saved him from walking into his house alone, well, they did say a kind deed carried its own reward.

* * *

By the time theyâ€™d reached the Rue TrÃ©moulins, Joan had forgottenâ€”partlyâ€”her various reasons for distress, in the sheer excitement of being in Paris. She had never seen so many people in one place at the same timeâ€”and that was only the folk coming out of Mass at a parish church! Round the corner, a pavement of fitted stones stretched wider than the whole River Ness, and those stones covered from one side to the other in barrows and wagons and stalls, rioting with fruit and vegetables and flowers and fish and meat â€¦ Sheâ€™d given Michael back his filthy handkerchief and was panting like a dog, turning her face to and fro, trying to draw all the wonderful smells into herself at once.

â€œYe look a bit better,â€ Michael said, smiling at her. He was still pale himself, but he, too, seemed happier. â€œAre ye hungry yet?â€

â€œIâ€™m famished!â€ She cast a starved look at the edge of the market. â€œCould we stop, maybe, and buy an apple? Iâ€™ve a bit of money.â€¦â€ She fumbled for the coins in her stocking top, but he stopped her.

â€œNay, thereâ€™ll be food a-plenty at the house. They were expecting me this week, so everything will be ready.â€

She stared longingly at the market for a brief moment, then turned obligingly in the direction he pointed, craning out the carriage window to see his house as they approached.

â€œThatâ€™s the biggest house Iâ€™ve ever seen!â€ she exclaimed.

â€œOch, no,â€ he said, laughing. â€œLallybrochâ€™s bigger than that.â€

â€œWell â€¦ this oneâ€™s taller,â€ she replied. And it wasâ€”a good four stories, and a huge roof of lead slates and green-coppered seams, with what must be more than a score of glass windows set in, and â€¦

She was still trying to count the windows when Michael helped her down from the carriage and offered her his arm to walk up to the door. She was goggling at the big yew trees set in brass pots and wondering how much trouble it must be to keep those polished, when she felt his arm go suddenly rigid as wood.

She glanced at Michael, startled, then looked where he was lookingâ€”toward the door of his house. The door had swung open, and three people were coming down the marble steps, smiling and waving, calling out.

â€œWhoâ€™s that?â€ Joan whispered, leaning close to Michael. The one short fellow in the striped apron must be a butler; sheâ€™d read about butlers. But the other man was a gentleman, limber as a willow tree and wearing a coat and waistcoat striped in lemon and pinkâ€”with a hat decorated with â€¦ well, she supposed it must be a feather, but sheâ€™d pay money to see the bird it came off. By comparison, she had hardly noticed the woman, who was dressed in black. But now she saw that Michael had eyes only for the woman.

â€œLÃ©â€”â€ he began, and choked it back. â€œLÃ©â€”LÃ©onie. LÃ©onie is her name. My wifeâ€™s sister.â€

Joan looked sharp then, because from the look of Michael Murray, heâ€™d just seen his wifeâ€™s ghost. But LÃ©onie seemed flesh and blood, slender and pretty, though her own face bore the same marks of sorrow as did Michaelâ€™s, and her face was pale under a small, neat black tricorne with a tiny curled blue feather.

â€œMichel,â€ she said. â€œOh, Michel!â€ And with tears brimming from eyes shaped like almonds, she threw herself into his arms.

Feeling extremely superfluous, Joan stood back a little and glanced at the gentleman in the lemon-striped waistcoatâ€”the butler had tactfully withdrawn into the house.

â€œCharles PÃ©pin, mademoiselle,â€ he said, sweeping off his hat. Taking her hand, he bowed low over it, and now she saw the band of black mourning he wore around his bright sleeve. â€œA votre service.â€

â€œOh,â€ she said, a little flustered. â€œUm. Joan MacKimmie. Je suis â€¦ er â€¦ um â€¦â€

â€œTell him not to do it,â€ said a sudden small, calm voice inside her head, and she jerked her own hand away as though heâ€™d bitten her.

â€œPleased to meet you,â€ she gasped. â€œExcuse me.â€ And, turning, threw up into one of the bronze yew pots.

* * *

Joan had been afraid it would be awkward, coming to Michaelâ€™s bereaved and empty house, but had steeled herself to offer comfort and support, as became a distant kinswoman and a daughter of God. She might have been miffed, therefore, to find herself entirely supplanted in the department of comfort and supportâ€”quite relegated to the negligible position of guest, in fact, served politely and asked periodically if she wished more wine, a slice of ham, some gherkins â€¦ but otherwise ignored, while Michaelâ€™s servants, sister-in-law, and â€¦ she wasnâ€™t quite sure of the position of M. PÃ©pin, though he seemed to have something personal to do with LÃ©onieâ€”perhaps someone had said he was her cousin?â€”all swirled round Michael like perfumed bathwater, warm and buoyant, touching him, kissing himâ€”well, all right, sheâ€™d heard of men kissing one another in France, but she couldnâ€™t help staring when M. PÃ©pin gave Michael a big wet one on both cheeksâ€”and generally making a fuss over him.

She was more than relieved, though, not to have to make conversation in French, beyond a simple merci or sâ€™il vous plaÃ®t from time to time. It gave her a chance to settle her nervesâ€”and her stomach, and she would say the wine was a wonder for thatâ€”and to keep a close eye on Monsieur Charles PÃ©pin.

â€œTell him not to do it.â€ And just what dâ€™ye mean by that? she demanded of the voice. She didnâ€™t get an answer, which didnâ€™t surprise her. The voices werenâ€™t much for details.

She couldnâ€™t tell whether the voices were male or female; they didnâ€™t seem either one, and she wondered whether they might maybe be angelsâ€”angels didnâ€™t have a sex, and doubtless that saved them a lot of trouble. Joan of Arcâ€™s voices had had the decency to introduce themselves, but not hers, oh, no. On the other hand, if they were angels and told her their names, she wouldnâ€™t recognize them anyway, so perhaps thatâ€™s why they didnâ€™t bother.

Well, so. Did this particular voice mean that Charles PÃ©pin was a villain? She squinted closely at him. He didnâ€™t look it. He had a strong, good-looking face, and Michael seemed to like himâ€”after all, Michael must be a fair judge of character, she thought, and him in the wine business.

What was it Monsieur Charles PÃ©pin oughtnâ€™t to do, though? Did he have some wicked crime in mind? Or might he be bent on doing away with himself, like that poor wee gomerel on the boat? There was still a trace of slime on her hand, from the seaweed.

She rubbed her hand inconspicuously against the skirt of her dress, frustrated. She hoped the voices would stop once she was in the convent. That was her nightly prayer. But if they didnâ€™t, at least she might be able to tell someone there about them without fear of being packed off to a madhouse or stoned in the street. Sheâ€™d have a confessor, she knew that much. Maybe he could help her discover what God had meant, landing her with a gift like this, and no explanation what she was to do with it.

In the meantime, Monsieur PÃ©pin would bear watching; she should maybe say something to Michael before she left. Aye, what? she thought, helpless.

Still, she was glad to see that Michael grew less pale as they all carried on, vying to feed him tidbits, refill his glass, tell him bits of gossip. She was also pleased to find that she mostly understood what they were saying, as she relaxed. Jaredâ€”that would be Jared Fraser, Michaelâ€™s elderly cousin, whoâ€™d founded the wine company, and whose house this wasâ€”was still in Germany, they said, but was expected at any moment. He had sent a letter for Michael, too; where was it? No matter, it would turn up â€¦ and Madame Nesle de La Tourelle had had a fit, a veritable fit, at court last Wednesday, when she came face-to-face with Mademoiselle de Perpignan wearing a confection in the particular shade of pea green that was de La Tourelleâ€™s alone, and God alone knew why, because she always looked like a cheese in it, and had slapped her own maid so hard for pointing this out that the poor girl flew across the rushes and cracked her head on one of the mirrored wallsâ€”and cracked the mirror, too, very bad luck that, but no one could agree whether the bad luck was de La Tourelleâ€™s, the maidâ€™s, or de Perpignanâ€™s.

Birds, Joan thought dreamily, sipping her wine. They sound just like cheerful wee birds in a tree, all chattering away together.

â€œThe bad luck belongs to the seamstress who made the dress for de Perpignan,â€ Michael said, a faint smile touching his mouth. â€œOnce de La Tourelle finds out who it is.â€ His eye lighted on Joan then, sitting there with a forkâ€”an actual fork, and silver, too!â€”in her hand, her mouth half open in the effort of concentration required to follow the conversation.

â€œSister Joanâ€”Sister Gregory, I meanâ€”Iâ€™m that sorry, I was forgetting. If yeâ€™ve had enough to eat, will ye have a bit of a wash, maybe, before I deliver ye to the convent?â€

He was already rising, reaching for a bell, and before she knew where she was, a maidservant had whisked her off upstairs, deftly undressed her, and, wrinkling her nose at the smell of the discarded garments, wrapped Joan in a robe of the most amazing green silk, light as air, and ushered her into a small stone room with a copper bath in it, then disappeared, saying something in which Joan caught the word â€œeau.â€

She sat on the wooden stool provided, clutching the robe about her nakedness, head spinning with more than wine. She closed her eyes and took deep breaths, trying to put herself in the way of praying. God was everywhere, she assured herself, embarrassing as it was to contemplate him being with her in a bathroom in Paris. She shut her eyes harder and firmly began the rosary, starting with the Joyful Mysteries.

Sheâ€™d got through the Visitation before she began to feel steady again. This wasnâ€™t quite how sheâ€™d expected her first day in Paris to be. Still, sheâ€™d have something to write home to Mam about, that was for sure. If they let her write letters in the convent.

The maid came in with two enormous cans of steaming water and upended these into the bath with a tremendous splash. Another came in on her heels, similarly equipped, and between them they had Joan up, stripped, and stepping into the tub before sheâ€™d so much as said the first word of the Lordâ€™s Prayer for the third decade.

They said French things to her, which she didnâ€™t understand, and held out peculiar-looking instruments to her in invitation. She recognized the small pot of soap and pointed at it, and one of them at once poured water on her head and began to wash her hair!

She had for months been bidding farewell to her hair whenever she combed it, quite resigned to its loss, for whether she must sacrifice it immediately, as a postulant, or later, as a novice, plainly it must go. The shock of knowing fingers rubbing her scalp, the sheer sensual delight of warm water coursing through her hair, the soft wet weight of it lying in ropes down over her breastsâ€”was this Godâ€™s way of asking if sheâ€™d truly thought it through? Did she know what she was giving up?

Well, she did, then. And she had thought about it. On the other hand â€¦ she couldnâ€™t make them stop, really; it wouldnâ€™t be mannerly. The warmth of the water was making the wine sheâ€™d drunk course faster through her blood, and she felt as though she were being kneaded like toffee, stretched and pulled, all glossy and falling into languid loops. She closed her eyes and gave up trying to remember how many Hail Marys she had yet to go in the third decade.

It wasnâ€™t until the maids had hauled her, pink and steaming, out of the bath and wrapped her in a most remarkable huge fuzzy kind of towel that she emerged abruptly from her sensual trance. The cold air coalesced in her stomach, reminding her that all this luxury was indeed a lure of the devilâ€”for lost in gluttony and sinful bathing, sheâ€™d forgot entirely about the young man on the ship, the poor despairing sinner who had thrown himself into the sea.

The maids had gone for the moment. She dropped at once to her knees on the stone floor and threw off the coddling towels, exposing her bare skin to the full chill of the air in penance.

â€œMea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa,â€ she breathed, knocking a fist against her bosom in a paroxysm of sorrow and regret. The sight of the drowned young man was in her mind, soft brown hair fanned across his cheek, eyes half closed, seeing nothingâ€”and what terrible thing was it that heâ€™d seen, or thought of, before he jumped, that heâ€™d screamed so?

She thought briefly of Michael, the look on his face when he spoke of his poor wifeâ€”perhaps the young brown-haired man had lost someone dear and couldnâ€™t face his life alone?

She should have spoken to him. That was the undeniable, terrible truth. It didnâ€™t matter that she didnâ€™t know what to say. She should have trusted God to give her words, as he had when sheâ€™d spoken to Michael.

â€œForgive me, Father!â€ she said urgently, out loud. â€œPleaseâ€”forgive me, give me strength!â€

Sheâ€™d betrayed that poor young man. And herself. And God, whoâ€™d given her the terrible gift of sight for a reason. And the voices â€¦

â€œWhy did ye not tell me?â€ she cried. â€œHave ye nothing to say for yourselves?â€ Here sheâ€™d thought the voices those of angels, and they werenâ€™tâ€”just drifting bits of bog mist, getting into her head, pointless, useless â€¦ useless as she was, oh, Lord Jesus â€¦

She didnâ€™t know how long she knelt there, naked, half drunk, and in tears. She heard the muffled squeaks of dismay from the French maids, who poked their heads in and just as quickly withdrew them, but paid no attention. She didnâ€™t know if it was right even to pray for the poor young manâ€”for suicide was a mortal sin, and surely heâ€™d gone straight to hell. But she couldnâ€™t give him up; she couldnâ€™t. She felt somehow that heâ€™d been her charge, that sheâ€™d carelessly let him fall, and surely God would not hold the young man entirely responsible when it was she who should have been watching out for him.

And so she prayed, with all the energy of body and mind and spirit, asking mercy. Mercy for the young man, for wee Ronnie and wretched auld Angusâ€”mercy for poor Michael, and for the soul of Lillie, his dear wife, and their babe unborn. And mercy for herself, this unworthy vessel of Godâ€™s service.

â€œIâ€™ll do better!â€ she promised, sniffing and wiping her nose on the fluffy towel. â€œTruly, I will. Iâ€™ll be braver. I will.â€

* * *

Michael took the candlestick from the footman, said good night, and shut the door. He hoped Sister almost-Gregory was comfortable; heâ€™d told the staff to put her in the main guest room. He was fairly sure sheâ€™d sleep well. He smiled wryly to himself; unaccustomed to wine, and obviously nervous in company, sheâ€™d sipped her way through most of a decanter of Jerez sherry before he noticed, and was sitting in the corner with unfocused eyes and a small inward smile that reminded him of a painting he had seen at Versailles, a thing the steward had called La Gioconda.

He couldnâ€™t very well deliver her to the convent in such a condition and had gently escorted her upstairs and given her into the hands of the chambermaids, both of whom regarded her with some wariness, as though a tipsy nun were a particularly dangerous commodity.

Heâ€™d drunk a fair amount himself in the course of the afternoon and more at dinner. He and Charles had sat up late, talking and drinking rum punch. Not talking of anything in particular; he had just wanted not to be alone. Charles had invited him to go to the gaming roomsâ€”Charles was an inveterate gamblerâ€”but was kind enough to accept his refusal and simply bear him company.

The candle flame blurred briefly at thought of Charlesâ€™s kindness. He blinked and shook his head, which proved a mistake; the contents shifted abruptly, and his stomach rose in protest at the sudden movement. He barely made it to the chamber pot in time and, once evacuated, lay numbly on the floor, cheek pressed to the cold boards.

It wasnâ€™t that he couldnâ€™t get up and go to bed. It was that he couldnâ€™t face the thought of the cold white sheets, the pillows round and smooth, as though Lillieâ€™s head had never dented them, the bed never known the heat of her body.

Tears ran sideways over the bridge of his nose and dripped on the floor. There was a snuffling noise, and Plonplon came squirming out from under the bed and licked his face, whining anxiously. After a little while, he sat up and, leaning against the side of the bed with the dog in one arm, reached for the decanter of port that the butler had leftâ€”by instructionâ€”on the table beside it.

* * *

The smell was appalling. Rakoczy had wrapped a woolen comforter about his lower face, but the odor seeped in, putrid and cloying, clinging to the back of the throat, so that even breathing through the mouth didnâ€™t preserve you from the stench. He breathed as shallowly as he could, though, picking his way carefully past the edge of the cemetery by the narrow beam of a dark lantern. The mine lay well beyond it, but the stench carried amazingly when the wind blew from the east.

The chalk mine had been abandoned for years; it was rumored to be haunted. It was. Rakoczy knew what haunted it. Never religiousâ€”he was a philosopher and a natural scientist, a rationalistâ€”he still crossed himself by reflex at the head of the ladder that led down the shaft into those spectral depths.

At least the rumors of ghosts and earth demons and the walking dead would keep anyone from coming to investigate strange light glowing from the subterranean tunnels of the workings, if it was noticed at all. Though just in case â€¦ he opened the burlap bag, still redolent of rats, and fished out a bundle of pitchblende torches and the oiled-silk packet that held several lengths of cloth saturated with salpÃªtre, salts of potash, blue vitriol, verdigris, butter of antimony, and a few other interesting compounds from his laboratory.

He found the blue vitriol by smell and wrapped the cloth tightly around the head of one torch, thenâ€”whistling under his breathâ€”made three more torches, each impregnated with different salts. He loved this part. It was so simple, and so astonishingly beautiful.

He paused for a minute to listen, but it was well past dark and the only sounds were those of the night itselfâ€”frogs chirping and bellowing in the distant marshes by the cemetery, wind stirring the leaves of spring. A few hovels sat a half mile away, only one with firelight glowing dully from a smoke hole in the roof. Almost a pity thereâ€™s no one but me to see this. He took the little clay firepot from its wrappings and touched a coal to the cloth-wrapped torch. A tiny green flame flickered like a serpentâ€™s tongue, then burst into life in a brilliant globe of ghostly color.

He grinned at the sight, but there was no time to lose; the torches wouldnâ€™t last forever, and there was work to be done. He tied the bag to his belt and, with the green fire crackling softly in one hand, climbed down into darkness.

He paused at the bottom, breathing deep. The air was clear, the dust long settled. No one had been down here recently. The dull white walls glowed soft, eerie under the green light, and the passage yawned before him, black as a murdererâ€™s soul. Even knowing the place as well as he did, and with light in his hand, it gave him a qualm to walk into it.

Is that what death is like? he wondered. A black void that you walked into with no more than a feeble glimmer of faith in your hand? His lips compressed. Well, heâ€™d done that before, if less permanently. But he disliked the way that the notion of death seemed always to be lurking in the back of his mind these days.

The main tunnel was large, big enough for two men to walk side by side, and the roof was high enough above him that the roughly excavated chalk lay in shadow, barely touched by his torch. The side tunnels were smaller, though. He counted the ones on the left and, despite himself, hurried his step a little as he passed the fourth. That was where it lay, down the side tunnel, a turn to the left, another to the leftâ€”was it â€œwiddershinsâ€ the English called it, turning against the direction of the sun? He thought that was what MÃ©lisande had called it when sheâ€™d brought him here.â€¦

The sixth. His torch had begun to gutter already, and he pulled another from the bag and lit it from the remains of the first, which he dropped on the floor at the entrance to the side tunnel, leaving it to flare and smolder behind him, the smoke catching at his throat. He knew his way, but even so, it was as well to leave landmarks, here in the realm of everlasting night. The mine had deep rooms, one far back that showed strange paintings on the wall, of animals that didnâ€™t exist but had an astonishing vividness, as though they would leap from the wall and stampede down the passages. Sometimesâ€”rarelyâ€”he went all the way down into the bowels of the earth, just to look at them.

The fresh torch burned with the warm light of natural fire, and the white walls took on a rosy glow. So did the painting at the end of the corridor, this one different: a crude but effective rendering of the Annunciation. He didnâ€™t know who had made the paintings that appeared unexpectedly here and there in the minesâ€”most were of religious subjects, a few most emphatically notâ€”but they were useful. There was an iron ring in the wall by the Annunciation, and he set his torch into it.

Turn back at the Annunciation, then three paces â€¦ He stamped his foot, listening for the faint echo, and found it. Heâ€™d brought a trowel in his bag, and it was the work of a few moments to uncover the sheet of tin that covered his cache.

The cache itself was three feet deep and three feet squareâ€”he found satisfaction in the knowledge of its perfect cubicity whenever he saw it; any alchemist was by profession a numerologist, as well. It was half full, the contents wrapped in burlap or canvas, not things he wanted to carry openly through the streets. It took some prodding and unwrapping to find the pieces he wanted. Madame Fabienne had driven a hard bargain but a fair one: two hundred Ã¨cus a month times four months for the guaranteed exclusive use of Madeleineâ€™s services.

Four months would surely be enough, he thought, feeling a rounded shape through its wrappings. In fact, he thought one night would be enough, but his manâ€™s pride was restrained by a scientistâ€™s prudence. And even if â€¦ there was always some chance of early miscarriage; he wanted to be sure of the child before he undertook any more personal experiments with the space between times. If he knew that something of himselfâ€”someone with his peculiar abilitiesâ€”might be left, just in case this time â€¦

He could feel it there, somewhere in the smothered dark behind him. He knew he couldnâ€™t hear it now; it was silent, save on the days of solstice and equinox or when you actually walked into it â€¦ but he felt the sound of it in his bones, and it made his hands tremble on the wrappings.

The gleam of silver, of gold. He chose two gold snuffboxes, a filigreed necklace, andâ€”with some hesitationâ€”a small silver salver. Why did the void not affect metal? he wondered for the thousandth time. In fact, carrying gold or silver eased the passageâ€”or at least he thought so. MÃ©lisande had told him it did. But jewels were always destroyed by the passage, though they gave the most control and protection.

That made some sense; everyone knew that gemstones had a specific vibration that corresponded to the heavenly spheres, and the spheres themselves of course affected the earth: As above, so below. He still had no idea exactly how the vibrations should affect the space, the portal â€¦ it. But thinking about it gave him a need to touch them, to reassure himself, and he moved wrapped bundles out of the way, digging down to the left-hand corner of the wood-lined cache, where pressing on a particular nailhead caused one of the boards to loosen and turn sideways, rotating smoothly on spindles. He reached into the dark space thus revealed and found the small washleather bag, feeling his sense of unease dissipate at once when he touched it.

He opened it and poured the contents into his palm, glittering and sparking in the dark hollow of his hand. Red and blues and greens, the brilliant white of diamonds, the lavender and violet of amethyst, and the golden glow of topaz and citrine. Enough?

Enough to travel back, certainly. Enough to steer himself with some accuracy, to choose how far he went. But enough to go forward?

He weighed the glittering handful for a moment, then poured them carefully back. Not yet. But he had time to find more; he wasnâ€™t going anywhere for at least four months. Not until he was sure that Madeleine was well and truly with child.

* * *

â€œJoan.â€ Michael put his hand on her arm, keeping her from leaping out of the carriage. â€œYeâ€™re sure, now? I mean, if ye didna feel quite ready, yeâ€™re welcome to stay at my house untilâ€”â€

â€œIâ€™m ready.â€ She didnâ€™t look at him, and her face was pale as a slab of lard. â€œLet me go, please.â€

He reluctantly let go of her arm but insisted upon getting down with her and ringing the bell at the gate, stating their business to the portress. All the time, though, he could feel her shaking, quivering like a blancmange. Was it fear, though, or just understandable nerves? Heâ€™d feel a bit cattywampus himself, he thought with sympathy, were he making such a shift, beginning a new life so different from what had gone before.

The portress went away to fetch the mistress of postulants, leaving them in the little enclosure by the gatehouse. From here, he could see across a sunny courtyard with a cloister walk on the far side and what looked like extensive kitchen gardens to the right. To the left was the looming bulk of the hospital run by the order and, beyond that, the other buildings that belonged to the convent. It was a beautiful place, he thoughtâ€”and hoped the sight of it would settle her fears.

She made an inarticulate noise, and he glanced at her, alarmed to see what looked like tears slicking her cheeks.

â€œJoan,â€ he said more quietly, and handed her his fresh handkerchief. â€œDinna be afraid. If ye need me, send for me, anytime; Iâ€™ll come. And I meant it about the letters.â€

He would have said more, but just then the portress reappeared with Sister Eustacia, the postulant mistress, who greeted Joan with a kind motherliness that seemed to comfort her, for the girl sniffed and straightened herself and, reaching into her pocket, pulled out a little folded square, obviously kept with care through her travels.

â€œJâ€™ai une lettre,â€ she said in halting French. â€œPour Madame le â€¦ pour â€¦ Reverend Mother?â€ she said in a small voice. â€œMother Hildegarde?â€

â€œOui?â€ Sister Eustacia took the note with the same care with which it was proffered.

â€œItâ€™s from â€¦ her,â€ Joan said to Michael, having plainly run out of French. She still wouldnâ€™t look at him. â€œDaâ€™s â€¦ er â€¦ wife. You know. Claire.â€

â€œJesus Christ!â€ Michael blurted, making both the portress and the postulant mistress stare reprovingly at him.

â€œShe said she was a friend of Mother Hildegarde. And if she was still alive â€¦â€ She stole a look at Sister Eustacia, who appeared to have followed this.

â€œOh, Mother Hildegarde is certainly alive,â€ she assured Joan, in English. â€œAnd Iâ€™m sure she will be most interested to speak with you.â€ She tucked the note into her own capacious pocket and held out a hand. â€œNow, my dear child, if you are quite ready â€¦â€

â€œJe suis prÃªt,â€ Joan said, shaky but dignified. And so Joan MacKimmie of Balriggan passed through the gates of the Convent of Angels, still clutching Michael Murrayâ€™s clean handkerchief and smelling strongly of his dead wifeâ€™s scented soap.

* * *

Michael had dismissed his carriage and wandered restlessly about the city after leaving Joan at the convent, not wanting to go home. He hoped they would be good to her, hoped that sheâ€™d made the right decision.

Of course, he comforted himself, she wouldnâ€™t actually be a nun for some time. He didnâ€™t know quite how long it took, from entering as a postulant to becoming a novice to taking the final vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, but at least a few years. There would be time for her to be sure. And at least she was in a place of safety; the look of terror and distress on her face as sheâ€™d shot through the gates of the convent still haunted him. He strolled toward the river, where the evening light glowed on the water like a bronze mirror. The deckhands were tired and the dayâ€™s shouting had died away. In this light, the reflections of the boats gliding homeward seemed more substantial than the boats themselves.

Heâ€™d been surprised at the letter and wondered whether that had anything to do with Joanâ€™s distress. Heâ€™d had no notion that his uncleâ€™s wife had anything to do with le Couvent des Angesâ€”though now he cast his mind back, he did recall Jared mentioning that Uncle Jamie had worked in Paris in the wine business for a short time, back before the Rising. He supposed Claire might have met Mother Hildegarde then â€¦ but it was all before he was born.

He felt an odd warmth at the thought of Claire; he couldnâ€™t really think of her as his auntie, though she was. Heâ€™d not spent much time with her alone at Lallybrochâ€”but he couldnâ€™t forget the moment when sheâ€™d met him, alone at the door. Greeted him briefly and embraced him on impulse. And heâ€™d felt an instant sense of relief, as though sheâ€™d taken a heavy burden from his heart. Or maybe lanced a boil on his spirit, as she might one on his bum.

That thought made him smile. He didnâ€™t know what she wasâ€”the talk near Lallybroch painted her as everything from a witch to an angel, with most of the opinion hovering cautiously around â€œfaerie,â€ for the Auld Ones were dangerous, and you didnâ€™t talk too much about themâ€”but he liked her. So did Da and Young Ian, and that counted for a lot. And Uncle Jamie, of courseâ€”though everyone said, very matter-of-fact, that Uncle Jamie was bewitched. He smiled wryly at that. Aye, if being mad in love with your wife was bewitchment.

If anyone outside the family kent what sheâ€™d told themâ€”he cut that thought short. It wasnâ€™t something heâ€™d forget, but it wasnâ€™t something he wanted to think about just yet, either. The gutters of Paris running with blood â€¦ He glanced down involuntarily, but the gutters were full of the usual assortment of animal and human sewage, dead rats, and bits of rubbish too far gone to be salvaged for food even by the street beggars.

He walked, making his way slowly through the crowded streets, past La Chapelle and the Tuileries. If he walked enough, sometimes he could fall asleep without too much wine.

He sighed, elbowing his way through a group of buskers outside a tavern, turning back toward the Rue TrÃ©moulins. Some days, his head was like a bramble patch: thorns catching at him no matter which way he turned, and no path leading out of the tangle.

Paris wasnâ€™t a large city, but it was a complicated one; there was always somewhere else to walk. He crossed the Place de la Corcorde, thinking of what Claire had told them, seeing there in his mind the tall shadow of a terrible machine.

* * *

Joan had had her dinner with Mother Hildegarde, a lady so ancient and holy that Joan had feared to breathe too heavily, lest Mother Hildegarde fragment like a stale croissant and go straight off to heaven in front of her. Mother Hildegarde had been delighted with the letter Joan had delivered, though; it brought a faint flush to her face.

â€œFrom my â€¦ er â€¦â€ Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, what was the French word for â€œstepmotherâ€? â€œAhh â€¦ the wife of my â€¦â€ Fittens, she didnâ€™t know the word for â€œstepfather,â€ either! â€œThe wife of my father,â€ she ended weakly.

â€œYou are the daughter of my good friend Claire!â€ Mother had exclaimed. â€œAnd how is she?â€

â€œBonny, er â€¦ bon, I mean, last I saw her,â€ said Joan, and then tried to explain, but there was a lot of French being spoken very fast, and she gave up and accepted the glass of wine that Mother Hildegarde offered her. She was going to be a sot long before she took her vows, she thought, trying to hide her flushed face by bending down to pat Motherâ€™s wee dog, a fluffy, friendly creature the color of burnt sugar, named Bouton.

Whether it was the wine or Motherâ€™s kindness, her wobbly spirit steadied. Mother had welcomed her to the community and kissed her forehead at the end of the meal, before sending her off in the charge of Sister Eustacia to see the convent.

Now she lay on her narrow cot in the dormitory, listening to the breathing of a dozen other postulants. It sounded like a byre full of cows and had much the same warm, humid scentâ€”bar the manure. Her eyes filled with tears, the vision of the homely stone byre at Balriggan sudden and vivid in her mind. She swallowed them back, though, pinching her lips together. A few of the girls sobbed quietly, missing home and family, but she wouldnâ€™t be one of them. She was older than mostâ€”a few were nay more than fourteenâ€”and sheâ€™d promised God to be brave.

It hadnâ€™t been bad during the afternoon. Sister Eustacia had been very kind, taking her and a couple of other new postulants round the walled estate, showing them the big gardens where the convent grew medicinal herbs and fruit and vegetables for the table, the chapel where devotions were held six times a day, plus Mass in the mornings, the stables and kitchens, where they would take turns workingâ€”and the great HÃ´pital des Anges, the orderâ€™s main work. They had only seen the hÃ´pital from the outside, though; they would see the inside tomorrow, when Sister Marie-Amadeus would explain their duties.

It was strange, of courseâ€”she still understood only half what people said to her and was sure from the looks on their faces that they understood much less of what she tried to say to themâ€”but wonderful. She loved the spiritual discipline, the hours of devotion, with the sense of peace and unity that came upon the sisters as they chanted and prayed together. Loved the simple beauty of the chapel, amazing in its clean elegance, the solid lines of granite and the grace of carved wood, a faint smell of incense in the air, like the breath of angels.

The postulants prayed with the others but did not yet sing. They would be trained in musicâ€”such excitement! Mother Hildegarde had been a famous musician in her youth, it was rumored, and considered it one of the most important forms of devotion.

The thought of the new things sheâ€™d seen, and the new things to come, distracted her mindâ€”a littleâ€”from thoughts of her motherâ€™s voice, the wind off the moors, the â€¦ She shoved these hastily away and reached for her new rosary, this a substantial thing with smooth wooden beads, lovely and comforting in the fingers.

Above all, there was peace. She hadnâ€™t heard a word from the voices, hadnâ€™t seen anything peculiar or alarming. She wasnâ€™t foolish enough to think sheâ€™d escaped her dangerous gift, but at least there might be help at hand ifâ€”whenâ€”it came back.

And at least she already knew enough Latin to say her rosary properly; Da had taught her. â€œAve, Maria,â€ she whispered, â€œgratia plena, Dominus tecum,â€ and closed her eyes, the sobs of the homesick fading in her ears as the beads moved slow and silent through her fingers.

Next day

Michael Murray stood in the aisle of the aging shed, feeling puny and unreal. Heâ€™d waked with a terrible headache, the result of having drunk a great deal of mixed spirits on an empty stomach, and while the headache had receded to a dull throb at the back of his skull, it had left him feeling trampled and left for dead. His cousin Jared, owner of Fraser et Cie, looked at him with the cold eye of long experience, shook his head and sighed deeply, but said nothing, merely taking the list from his nerveless fingers and beginning the count on his own.

He wished Jared had rebuked him. Everyone still tiptoed round him, careful of him. And like a wet dressing on a wound, their care kept the wound of Lillieâ€™s loss open and weeping. The sight of LÃ©onie didnâ€™t help, eitherâ€”so much like Lillie to look at, so different in character. She said they must help and comfort each other and, to that end, came to visit every other day, or so it seemed. He really wished she would â€¦ just go away, though the thought shamed him.

â€œHowâ€™s the wee nun, then?â€ Jaredâ€™s voice, dry and matter-of-fact as always, drew him out of his bruised and soggy thoughts. â€œGive her a good send-off to the convent?â€

â€œAye. Wellâ€”aye. More or less.â€ Michael mustered up a feeble smile. He didnâ€™t really want to think about Sister Gregory this morning, either.

â€œWhat did ye give her?â€ Jared handed the checklist to Humberto, the Italian shed-master, and looked Michael over appraisingly. â€œI hope it wasna the new Rioja that did that to ye.â€

â€œAh â€¦ no.â€ Michael struggled to focus his attention. The heady atmosphere of the shed, thick with the fruity exhalations of the resting casks, was making him dizzy. â€œIt was Moselle. Mostly. And a bit of rum punch.â€

â€œOh, I see.â€ Jaredâ€™s ancient mouth quirked up on one side. â€œDid I never tell ye not to mix wine wiâ€™ rum?â€

â€œNot above two hundred times, no.â€ Jared was moving, and Michael followed him perforce down the narrow aisle, the casks in their serried ranks rising high above on either side.

â€œRumâ€™s a demon. But whiskyâ€™s a virtuous dram,â€ Jared said, pausing by a rack of small blackened casks. â€œSo long as itâ€™s a good make, itâ€™ll never turn on ye. Speakinâ€™ of whichâ€â€”he tapped the end of one cask, which gave off the resonant deep thunk of a full barrelâ€”â€œwhatâ€™s this? It came up from the docks this morning.â€

â€œOh, aye.â€ Michael stifled a belch and smiled painfully. â€œThat, cousin, is the Ian Alastair Robert MacLeod Murray memorial uisge baugh. My da and Uncle Jamie made it during the winter. They thought ye might like a wee cask for your personal use.â€

Jaredâ€™s brows rose and he gave Michael a swift sideways glance. Then he turned back to examine the cask, bending close to sniff at the seam between the lid and staves.

â€œIâ€™ve tasted it,â€ Michael assured him. â€œI dinna think it will poison ye. But ye should maybe let it age a few years.â€

Jared made a rude noise in his throat, and his hand curved gently over the swell of the staves. He stood thus for a moment as though in benediction, then turned suddenly and took Michael into his arms. His own breathing was hoarse, congested with sorrow. He was years older than Da and Uncle Jamie but had known the two of them all their lives.

â€œIâ€™m sorry for your faither, lad,â€ he said after a moment, and let go, patting Michael on the shoulder. He looked at the cask and sniffed deeply. â€œI can tell it will be fine.â€ He paused, breathing slowly, then nodded once, as though making up his mind to something.

â€œIâ€™ve a thing in mind, a charaid. Iâ€™d been thinking, since ye went to Scotlandâ€”and now that weâ€™ve a kinswoman in the church, so to speak â€¦ Come back to the office with me, and Iâ€™ll tell ye.â€

* * *

It was chilly in the street, but the goldsmithâ€™s back room was cozy as a womb, with a porcelain stove throbbing with heat and woven wool hangings on the walls. Rakoczy hastily unwound the comforter about his neck. It didnâ€™t do to sweat indoors; the sweat chilled the instant one went out again, and next thing you knew, it would be la grippe at the best, pleurisy or pneumonia at the worst.

Rosenwald himself was comfortable in shirt and waistcoat, without even a wig, only a plum-colored turban to keep his polled scalp warm. The goldsmithâ€™s stubby fingers traced the curves of the octofoil salver, turned it overâ€”and stopped dead. Rakoczy felt the tingle of warning at the base of his spine and deliberately relaxed himself, affecting a nonchalant self-confidence.

â€œWhere did you get this, monsieur, if I may ask?â€ Rosenwald looked up at him, but there was no accusation in the goldsmithâ€™s aged faceâ€”only a wary excitement.

â€œIt was an inheritance,â€ Rakoczy said, glowing with earnest innocence. â€œAn elderly aunt left itâ€”and a few other piecesâ€”to me. Is it worth anything more than the value of the silver?â€

The goldsmith opened his mouth, then shut it, glancing at Rakoczy. Was he honest? Rakoczy wondered with interest. Heâ€™s already told me itâ€™s something special. Will he tell me why, in hopes of getting other pieces? Or lie, to get this one cheap? Rosenwald had a good reputation, but he was a Jew.

â€œPaul de Lamerie,â€ Rosenwald said reverently, his index finger tracing the hallmark. â€œThis was made by Paul de Lamerie.â€

A shock ran up Rakoczyâ€™s backbone. Merde! Heâ€™d brought the wrong one!

â€œReally?â€ he said, striving for simple curiosity. â€œDoes that mean something?â€

It means Iâ€™m a fool, he thought, and wondered whether to snatch the thing back and leave instantly. The goldsmith had carried it away, though, to look at it more closely under the lamp.

â€œDe Lamerie was one of the very best goldsmiths ever to work in Londonâ€”perhaps in the world,â€ Rosenwald said, half to himself.

â€œIndeed,â€ Rakoczy said politely. He was sweating freely. Nom dâ€™une pipe! Wait, thoughâ€”Rosenwald had said â€œwas.â€ De Lamerie was dead, then, thank God. Perhaps the Duke of Sandringham, from whom heâ€™d stolen the salver, was dead, too? He began to breathe more easily.

He never sold anything identifiable within a hundred years of his acquisition of it; that was his principle. Heâ€™d taken the other salver from a rich merchant in a game of cards in the Low Countries in 1630; heâ€™d stolen this one in 1745â€”much too close for comfort. Still â€¦

His thoughts were interrupted by the chime of the silver bell over the door, and he turned to see a young man come in, removing his hat to reveal a startling head of dark-red hair. He was dressed Ã  la mode and addressed the goldsmith in perfect Parisian French, but he didnâ€™t look French. A long-nosed face with faintly slanted eyes. There was a slight sense of familiarity about that face, yet Rakoczy was sure heâ€™d never seen this man before.

â€œPlease, sir, go on with your business,â€ the young man said with a courteous bow. â€œI meant no interruption.â€

â€œNo, no,â€ Rakoczy said, stepping forward. He motioned the young man toward the counter. â€œPlease, go ahead. Monsieur Rosenwald and I are merely discussing the value of this object. It will take some thought.â€ He snaked out an arm and seized the salver, feeling a little better with it clasped to his bosom. He wasnâ€™t sure; if he decided it was too risky to sell, he could slink out quietly while Rosenwald was busy with the redheaded young man.

The Jew looked surprised but, after a momentâ€™s hesitation, nodded and turned to the young man, who introduced himself as one Michael Murray, partner in Fraser et Cie, the wine merchants.

â€œI believe you are acquainted with my cousin Jared Fraser?â€

Rosenwaldâ€™s round face lighted at once. â€œOh, to be sure, sir! A man of the most exquisite taste and discrimination. I made him a wine cistern with a motif of sunflowers, not a year past!â€

â€œI know.â€ The young man smiled, a smile that creased his cheeks and narrowed his eyes, and that small bell of recognition rang again. But the name held no familiarity to Rakoczyâ€”only the face, and that only vaguely.

â€œMy uncle has another commission for you, if itâ€™s agreeable?â€

â€œI never say no to honest work, monsieur.â€ From the pleasure apparent on the goldsmithâ€™s rubicund face, honest work that paid very well was even more welcome.

â€œWell, thenâ€”if I may?â€ The young man pulled a folded paper from his pocket but half-turned toward Rakoczy, eyebrow cocked in inquiry. Rakoczy motioned him to go on and turned himself to examine a music box that stood on the counterâ€”an enormous thing the size of a cowâ€™s head, crowned with a nearly naked nymph festooned with the airiest of gold draperies and dancing on mushrooms and flowers, in company with a large frog.

â€œA chalice,â€ Murray was saying, the paper laid flat on the counter. From the corner of his eye, Rakoczy could see that it held a list of names. â€œItâ€™s a presentation to the chapel at le Couvent des Anges, to be given in memory of my late father. A young cousin of mine has just entered the convent there as a postulant,â€ he explained. â€œSo Monsieur Fraser thought that the best place.â€

â€œAn excellent choice.â€ Rosenwald picked up the list. â€œAnd you wish all of these names inscribed?â€

â€œYes, if you can.â€

â€œMonsieur!â€ Rosenwald waved a hand, professionally insulted. â€œThese are your fatherâ€™s children?â€

â€œYes, these at the bottom.â€ Murray bent over the counter, his finger tracing the lines, speaking the outlandish names carefully. â€œAt the top, these are my parentsâ€™ names: Ian Alastair Robert MacLeod Murray, and Janet Flora Arabella Fraser Murray. Now, also, Iâ€”we, I meanâ€”we want these two names, as well: James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser, and Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp Fraser. Those are my uncle and aunt; my uncle was very close to my father,â€ he explained. â€œAlmost a brother.â€

He went on saying something else, but Rakoczy wasnâ€™t listening. He grasped the edge of the counter, vision flickering so that the nymph seemed to leer at him.

Claire Fraser. That had been the womanâ€™s name, and her husband, James, a Highland lord from Scotland. That was who the young man resembled, though he was not so imposing as â€¦ But La Dame Blanche! It was her, it had to be.

And in the next instant, the goldsmith confirmed this, straightening up from the list with an abrupt air of wariness, as though one of the names might spring off the paper and bite him.

â€œThat nameâ€”your aunt, sheâ€™d be? Did she and your uncle live in Paris at one time?â€

â€œYes,â€ Murray said, looking mildly surprised. â€œMaybe thirty years agoâ€”only for a short time, though. Did you know her?â€

â€œAh. Not to say I was personally acquainted,â€ Rosenwald said, with a crooked smile. â€œBut she was â€¦ known. People called her La Dame Blanche.â€

Murray blinked, clearly surprised to hear this.

â€œReally?â€ He looked rather appalled.

â€œYes, but it was all a long time ago,â€ Rosenwald said hastily, clearly thinking heâ€™d said too much. He waved a hand toward his back room. â€œIf youâ€™ll give me a moment, monsieur, I have a chalice actually here, if you would care to see itâ€”and a paten, too; we might make some accommodation of price, if you take both. They were made for a patron who died suddenly, before the chalice was finished, so there is almost no decorationâ€”plenty of room for the names to be applied, and perhaps we might put the, um, aunt and uncle on the paten?â€

Murray nodded, interested, and, at Rosenwaldâ€™s gesture, went round the counter and followed the old man into his back room. Rakoczy put the octofoil salver under his arm and left, as quietly as possible, head buzzing with questions.

* * *

Jared eyed Michael over the dinner table, shook his head, and bent to his plate.

â€œIâ€™m not drunk!â€ Michael blurted, then bent his own head, face flaming. He could feel Jaredâ€™s eyes boring into the top of his head.

â€œNot now, yeâ€™re not.â€ Jaredâ€™s voice wasnâ€™t accusing. In fact, it was quiet, almost kindly. â€œBut ye have been. Yeâ€™ve not touched your dinner, and yeâ€™re the color of rotten wax.â€

â€œIâ€”â€ The words caught in his throat, just as the food had. Eels in garlic sauce. The smell wafted up from the dish, and he stood up suddenly, lest he either vomit or burst into tears.

â€œIâ€™ve nay appetite, cousin,â€ he managed to say, before turning away. â€œExcuse me.â€

He would have left, but he hesitated that moment too long, not wanting to go up to the room where Lillie no longer was but not wanting to look petulant by rushing out into the street. Jared rose and came round to him with a decided step.

â€œIâ€™m nay verra hungry myself, a charaid,â€ Jared said, taking him by the arm. â€œCome sit wiâ€™ me for a bit and take a dram. Itâ€™ll settle your wame.â€

He didnâ€™t much want to, but there was nothing else he could think of doing, and within a few moments he found himself in front of a fragrant applewood fire, with a glass of his fatherâ€™s whisky in hand, the warmth of both easing the tightness of chest and throat. It wouldnâ€™t cure his grief, he knew, but it made it possible to breathe.

â€œGood stuff,â€ Jared said, sniffing cautiously but approvingly. â€œEven raw as it is. Itâ€™ll be wonderful aged a few years.â€

â€œAye. Uncle Jamie kens what heâ€™s about; he said heâ€™d made whisky a good many times in America.â€

Jared chuckled.

â€œYour uncle Jamie usually kens what heâ€™s about,â€ he said. â€œNot that knowing it keeps him out oâ€™ trouble.â€ He shifted, making himself more comfortable in his worn leather chair. â€œHad it not been for the Rising, heâ€™d likely have stayed here wiâ€™ me. Aye, well â€¦â€ The old man sighed with regret and lifted his glass, examining the spirit. It was still nearly as pale as waterâ€”it hadnâ€™t been casked above a few monthsâ€”but had the slightly viscous look of a fine strong spirit, as if it might climb out of the glass if you took your eye off it.

â€œAnd if he had, I suppose Iâ€™d not be here myself,â€ Michael said dryly.

Jared glanced at him, surprised.

â€œOch! I didna mean to say ye were but a poor substitute for Jamie, lad.â€ He smiled crookedly, and his hooded eyes grew moist. â€œNot at all. Yeâ€™ve been the best thing ever to come to me. You and dear wee Lillie, and â€¦â€ He cleared his throat. â€œI â€¦ well, I canna say anything that will help, I ken that. But â€¦ it wonâ€™t always be like this.â€

â€œWonâ€™t it?â€ Michael said bleakly. â€œAye, Iâ€™ll take your word for it.â€ A silence fell between them, broken only by the hissing and snap of the fire. The mention of Lillie was like an awl digging into his breastbone, and he took a deeper sip of the whisky to quell the ache. Maybe Jared was right to mention the drink to him. It helped, but not enough. And the help didnâ€™t last. He was tired of waking to grief and headache both.

Shying away from thoughts of Lillie, his mind fastened on Uncle Jamie instead. Heâ€™d lost his wife, too, and from what Michael had seen of the aftermath, it had torn his soul in two. Then sheâ€™d come back to him, and he was a man transformed. But in between â€¦ heâ€™d managed. Heâ€™d found a way to be.

Thinking of Auntie Claire gave him a slight feeling of comfort: as long as he didnâ€™t think too much about what sheâ€™d told the family, whoâ€”or whatâ€”she was, and where sheâ€™d been while she was gone those twenty years. The brothers and sisters had talked among themselves about it afterward; Young Jamie and Kitty didnâ€™t believe a word of it, Maggie and Janet werenâ€™t sureâ€”but Young Ian believed it, and that counted for a lot with Michael. And sheâ€™d looked at himâ€”right at himâ€”when she said what was going to happen in Paris. He felt the same small thrill of horror now, remembering. The Terror. Thatâ€™s what it will be called, and thatâ€™s what it will be. People will be arrested for no cause and beheaded in the Place de la Concorde. The streets will run with blood, and no oneâ€”no oneâ€”will be safe.

He looked at his cousin; Jared was an old man, though still hale enough. Michael knew there was no way he could persuade Jared to leave Paris and his wine business. But it would be some time yetâ€”if Auntie Claire was right. No need to think about it now. But sheâ€™d seemed so sure, like a seer, talking from a vantage point after everything had happened, from a safer time.

And yet sheâ€™d come back from that safe time, to be with Uncle Jamie again.

For a moment, he entertained the wild fantasy that Lillie wasnâ€™t dead but only swept away into a distant time. He couldnâ€™t see or touch her, but the knowledge that she was doing things, was alive â€¦ maybe it was knowing that, thinking that, that had kept Uncle Jamie whole. He swallowed, hard.

â€œJared,â€ he said, clearing his own throat. â€œWhat did ye think of Auntie Claire? When she lived here?â€

Jared looked surprised but lowered his glass to his knee, pursing his lips in thought.

â€œShe was a bonny lass, Iâ€™ll tell ye that,â€ he said. â€œVerra bonny. A tongue like the rough side of a rasp, if she took against something, thoughâ€”and decided opinions.â€ He nodded, twice, as though recalling a few, and grinned suddenly. â€œVerra decided indeed!â€

â€œAye? The goldsmithâ€”Rosenwald, ye ken?â€”mentioned her when I went to commission the chalice and he saw her name on the list. He called her La Dame Blanche.â€ This last was not phrased as a question, but he gave it a slight rising inflection, and Jared nodded, his smile widening into a grin.

â€œOh, aye, I mind that! â€™Twas Jamieâ€™s notion. Sheâ€™d find herself now and then in dangerous places without himâ€”ken how some folk are just the sort as things happen toâ€”so he put it about that she was La Dame Blanche. Ken what a White Lady is, do ye?â€

Michael crossed himself, and Jared followed suit, nodding.

â€œAye, just so. Make any wicked sod with villainy in mind think twice. A White Lady can strike ye blind or shrivel a manâ€™s balls, and likely a few more things than that, should she take the notion. And Iâ€™d be the last to say that Claire Fraser couldnâ€™t, if sheâ€™d a mind to.â€ Jared raised the glass absently to his lips, took a bigger sip of the raw spirit than heâ€™d meant to, and coughed, spraying droplets of memorial whisky halfway across the room.

Rather to his own shock, Michael laughed.

Jared wiped his mouth, still coughing, but then sat up straight and lifted his glass, which still held a few drops.

â€œTo your da. SlÃ inte mhath!â€

â€œSlÃ inte!â€ Michael echoed, and drained what remained in his own glass. He set it down with finality and rose. Heâ€™d drink nay more tonight.

â€œOidhche mhath, mo brÃ thair-athar no mathar.â€

â€œGood night, lad,â€ said Jared. The fire was burning low but still cast a warm ruddy glow on the old manâ€™s face. â€œFare ye well.â€

Next night

Michael dropped his key several times before finally managing to turn it in the old-fashioned lock. It wasnâ€™t drink; heâ€™d not had a drop since the wine at supper. Instead, heâ€™d walked the length of the city and back, accompanied only by his thoughts; his whole body quivered and he felt mindless with exhaustion, but he was sure he would sleep. Jean-Baptiste had left the door unbarred, according to his orders, but one of the footmen was sprawled on a settle in the entryway, snoring. He smiled a little, though it was an effort to raise the corners of his mouth.

â€œBolt the door and go to bed, Alphonse,â€ he whispered, bending and shaking the man gently by the shoulder. The footman stirred and snorted, but Michael didnâ€™t wait to see whether he woke entirely. There was a tiny oil lamp burning on the landing of the stairs, a little round glass globe in the gaudy colors of Murano. It had been there since the first day he came from Scotland to stay with Jared, years before, and the sight of it soothed him and drew his aching body up the wide, dark stair.

The house creaked and talked to itself at night; all old houses did. Tonight, though, it was silent, the big copper-seamed roof gone cold and its massive timbers settled into somnolence.

He flung off his clothes and crawled naked into bed, head spinning. Tired as he was, his flesh quivered and twitched, his legs jerking like a spitted frogâ€™s, before he finally relaxed enough to fall headfirst into the seething cauldron of dreams that awaited him.

She was there, of course. Laughing at him, playing with her ridiculous pug. Running a hand filled with desire across his face, down his neck, easing her body close, and closer. Then they were somehow in bed, with the wind blowing cool through gauzy curtains, too cool, he felt cold, but then her warmth came close, pressed against him. He felt a terrible desire but at the same time feared her. She felt utterly familiar, utterly strangeâ€”and the mixture thrilled him.

He reached for her and realized that he couldnâ€™t raise his arms, couldnâ€™t move. And yet she was against him, writhing in a slow squirm of need, greedy and tantalizing. In the way of dreams, he was at the same time in front of her, behind her, touching, and seeing from a distance. Candle glow on naked breasts, the shadowed weight of solid buttocks, falling drapes of parting white, one round, firm leg protruding, a pointed toe rooting gently between his legs. Urgency.

She was curled behind him then, kissing the back of his neck, and he reached back, groping, but his hands were heavy, drifting; they slid helpless over her. Hers on him were firm, more than firmâ€”she had him by the cock, was working him. Working him hard, fast and hard. He bucked and heaved, suddenly released from the dream swamp of immobility. She loosed her grip, tried to pull away, but he folded his hand round hers and rubbed their folded hands hard up and down with joyous ferocity, spilling himself convulsively, hot wet spurts against his belly, running thick over their clenched knuckles.

She made a sound of horrified disgust, and his eyes flew open. Staring into them were a pair of huge, bugging eyes, over a gargoyleâ€™s mouth full of tiny, sharp teeth. He shrieked.

Plonplon leaped off the bed and ran to and fro, barking hysterically. There was a body behind him. Michael flung himself off the bed, tangled in a winding sheet of damp, sticky bedclothes, then fell and rolled in panic.

â€œJesus, Jesus, Jesus!â€

On his knees, he gaped, rubbed his hands hard over his face, shook his head. Could not make sense of it, couldnâ€™t.

â€œLillie,â€ he gasped. â€œLillie!â€

But the woman in his bed, tears running down her face, wasnâ€™t Lillie; he realized it with a wrench that made him groan, doubling up in the desolation of fresh loss.

â€œOh, Jesus!â€

â€œMichel, Michel, please, please forgive me!â€

â€œYou â€¦ what â€¦ for Godâ€™s sake â€¦!â€

LÃ©onie was weeping frantically, reaching out toward him.

â€œI couldnâ€™t help it. Iâ€™m so lonely, I wanted you so much!â€

Plonplon had ceased barking and now came up behind Michael, nosing his bare backside with a blast of hot, moist breath.

â€œVa-tâ€™en!â€

The pug backed up and started barking again, eyes bulging with offense.

Unable to find any words suitable to the situation, he grabbed the dog and muffled it with a handful of sheet. He got unsteadily to his feet, still holding the squirming pug.

â€œIâ€”â€ he began. â€œYouâ€”I mean â€¦ oh, Jesus Christ!â€ He leaned over and put the dog carefully on the bed. Plonplon instantly wriggled free of the sheet and rushed to LÃ©onie, licking her solicitously. Michael had thought of giving her the dog after Lillieâ€™s death, but for some reason this had seemed a betrayal of the pugâ€™s former mistress and brought Michael near to weeping.

â€œI canâ€™t,â€ he said simply. â€œI just canâ€™t. You go to sleep now, lass. Weâ€™ll talk about it later, aye?â€

He went out, walking carefully, as though very drunk, and closed the door gently behind him. He got halfway down the main stair before realizing he was naked. He stood there, his mind blank, watching the colors of the Murano lamp fade as the daylight grew outside, until Paul saw him and ran up to wrap him in a cloak and lead him off to a bed in one of the guest rooms.

* * *

Rakoczyâ€™s favorite gaming club was the Golden Cockerel, and the wall in the main salon was covered by a tapestry featuring one of these creatures, worked in gold thread, wings spread, and throat swollen as it crowed in triumph at the winning hand of cards laid out before it. It was a cheerful place, catering to a mix of wealthy merchants and lesser nobility, and the air was spicy with the scents of candle wax, powder, perfume, and money.

Heâ€™d thought of going to the offices of Fraser et Cie, making some excuse to speak to Michael Murray, and maneuvering his way into an inquiry about the whereabouts of the young manâ€™s aunt. Upon consideration, though, he thought such a move might make Murray waryâ€”and possibly lead to word getting back to the woman, if she was somewhere in Paris. That was the last thing he wanted to happen.

Better, perhaps, to instigate his inquiries from a more discreet distance. Heâ€™d learned that Murray occasionally came to the Cockerel, though he himself had never seen him there. But if he was known â€¦

It took several evenings of play, wine, and conversation before he found Charles PÃ©pin. PÃ©pin was a popinjay, a reckless gambler, and a man who liked to talk. And to drink. He was also a good friend of the young wine merchantâ€™s.

â€œOh, the nun!â€ he said, when Rakoczy hadâ€”after the second bottleâ€”mentioned having heard that Murray had a young relative who had recently entered the convent. PÃ©pin laughed, his handsome face flushed.

â€œA less likely nun Iâ€™ve never seenâ€”an arse that would make the archbishop of Paris forget his vows, and heâ€™s eighty-six if heâ€™s a day. Doesnâ€™t speak any sort of French, poor thingâ€”the girl, not the archbishop. Not that I for one would be wanting to carry on a lot of conversation if I had her to myself, you understand.â€¦ Sheâ€™s Scotch; terrible accent â€¦â€

â€œScotch, you say.â€ Rakoczy held a card consideringly, then put it down. â€œShe is Murrayâ€™s cousinâ€”would she perhaps be the daughter of his uncle James?â€

PÃ©pin looked blank for a moment.

â€œI donâ€™t reallyâ€”oh, yes, I do know!â€ He laughed heartily, and laid down his own losing hand. â€œDear me. Yes, she did say her fatherâ€™s name was Jay-mee, the way the Scotches do; that must be James.â€

Rakoczy felt a ripple of anticipation go up his spine. Yes! This sense of triumph was instantly succeeded by a breathless realization. The girl was the daughter of La Dame Blanche.

â€œI see,â€ he said casually. â€œAnd which convent did you say the girl has gone to?â€

To his surprise, PÃ©pin gave him a suddenly sharp look.

â€œWhy do you want to know?â€

Rakoczy shrugged, thinking fast.

â€œA wager,â€ he said, with a grin. â€œIf she is as luscious as you say â€¦ Iâ€™ll bet you five hundred louis that I can get her into bed before she takes her first vows.â€

PÃ©pin scoffed.

â€œOh, never! Sheâ€™s tasty, but she doesnâ€™t know it. And sheâ€™s virtuous, Iâ€™d swear it. And if you think you can seduce her inside the convent â€¦!â€

Rakoczy lounged back in his chair and motioned for another bottle.

â€œIn that case â€¦ what do you have to lose?â€

Next day

She could smell the hÃ´pital long before the small group of new postulants reached the door. They walked two by two, practicing custody of the eyes, but she couldnâ€™t help a quick glance upward at the building, a three-story chateau, originally a noble house that hadâ€”rumor saidâ€”been given to Mother Hildegarde by her father, as part of her dowry when she joined the church. It had become a convent house and then gradually had been given over more and more to the care of the sick, the nuns moving to the new chateau built in the park.

It was a lovely old houseâ€”on the outside. The odor of sickness, of urine and shit and vomit, hung about it like a cloying veil, though, and she hoped she wouldnâ€™t vomit, too. The little postulant next to her, Sister MisÃ©ricorde de Dieu (known to all simply as Mercy), was as white as her veil, eyes fixed on the ground but obviously not seeing it: she stepped smack on a slug and gave a small cry of horror as it squished under her sandal.

Joan looked hastily away; she would never master custody of the eyes, she was sure. Nor yet custody of thought.

It wasnâ€™t the notion of sick people that troubled her. Sheâ€™d seen sick people before, and they wouldnâ€™t be expecting her to do more than wash and feed them; she could manage that easily. It was fear of seeing those who were about to dieâ€”for surely there would be a great many of those in a hospital. And what might the voices tell her about them?

As it was, the voices had nothing to say. Not a word, and after a little she began to lose her nervousness. She could do this and in fact, to her surprise, quite enjoyed the sense of competence, the gratification of being able to ease someoneâ€™s pain, give them at least a little attentionâ€”and if her French made them laugh (and it did), that at least took their minds off pain and fear for a moment.

There were those who lay under the veil of death. Only a few, though, and it seemed somehow much less shocking here than when she had seen it on Vhairiâ€™s lad or the young man on the ship. Maybe it was resignation, perhaps the influence of the angels for whom the hÃ´pital was named â€¦ Joan didnâ€™t know, but she found that she wasnâ€™t afraid to speak to or touch the ones she knew were going to die. For that matter, she observed that the other sisters, even the orderlies, behaved gently toward these people, and it occurred to her that no particular sight was needed to know that the man with the wasting sickness, whose bones poked through his skin, was not long for this world.

Touch him, said a soft voice inside her head. Comfort him.

All right, she said, taking a deep breath. She had no idea how to comfort anyone, but she bathed him, as gently as she could, and coaxed him to take a few spoonsful of porridge. Then she settled him in his bed, straightening his nightshirt and the thin blanket over him.

â€œThank you, Sister,â€ he said, and, taking her hand, kissed it. â€œThank you for your sweet touch.â€

She went back to the postulantsâ€™ dormitory that evening feeling thoughtful, but with a strange sense of being on the verge of discovering something important.

That night

Rakoczy lay with his head on Madeleineâ€™s bosom, eyes closed, breathing the scent of her body, feeling the whole of her between his palms, a slowly pulsing entity of light. She was a gentle gold, traced with veins of incandescent blue, her heart deep as lapis beneath his ear, a living stone. And, deep inside, her red womb, open, soft. Refuge and succor. Promise.

MÃ©lisande had shown him the rudiments of sexual magic, and heâ€™d read about it with great interest in some of the older alchemical texts. Heâ€™d never tried it with a whore, thoughâ€”and, in fact, hadnâ€™t been trying to do it this time. And yet it had happened. Was happening. He could see the miracle unfolding slowly before him, under his hands.

How odd, he thought dreamily, watching the tiny traces of green energy spread upward through her womb, slowly but inexorably. Heâ€™d thought it happened instantly, that a manâ€™s seed found its root in the woman and there you were. But that wasnâ€™t what was happening at all. There were two types of seed, he now saw. She had one; he felt it plainly, a brilliant speck of light, glowing like a fierce, tiny sun. His ownâ€”the tiny green animalculaâ€”were being drawn toward it, bent on immolation.

â€œHappy, chÃ©ri?â€ she whispered, stroking his hair. â€œDid you have a good time?â€

â€œMost happy, sweetheart.â€ He wished she wouldnâ€™t talk, but an unexpected sense of tenderness toward her made him sit up and smile at her. She also began to sit up, reaching for the clean rag and douching syringe, and he put a hand on her shoulder, urging her to lie back down.

â€œDonâ€™t douche this time, ma belle,â€ he said. â€œA favor to me.â€

â€œButâ€”â€ She was confused; usually he was insistent upon cleanliness. â€œDo you want me to get with child?â€ For he had stopped her using the wine-soaked sponge beforehand, too.

â€œYes, of course,â€ he said, surprised. â€œDid Madame Fabienne not tell you?â€

Her mouth dropped open.

â€œShe did not. Whatâ€”why, for Godâ€™s sake?â€ In agitation, she squirmed free of his restraining hand and swung her legs out of bed, reaching for her wrapper. â€œYou arenâ€™tâ€”what do you mean to do with it?â€

â€œDo with it?â€ he said, blinking. â€œWhat do you mean, do with it?â€

She had the wrapper on, pulled crookedly round her shoulders, and had backed up against the wall, hands plastered against her stomach, regarding him with open fear.

â€œYouâ€™re a magicien; everyone knows that. You take newborn children and use their blood in your spells!â€

â€œWhat?â€ he said, rather stupidly. He reached for his breeches but changed his mind. He got up and went to her instead, putting his hands on her shoulders.

â€œNo,â€ he said, bending down to look her in the eye. â€œNo, I do no such thing. Never.â€ He used all the force of sincerity he could summon, pushing it into her, and felt her waver a little, still fearful but less certain. He smiled at her.

â€œWho told you I was a magicien, for heavenâ€™s sake? I am a philosophe, chÃ©rieâ€”an inquirer into the mysteries of nature, no more. And I can swear to you, by my hope of heavenâ€â€”this being more or less nonexistent, but why quibble?â€”â€œthat I have never, not once, used anything more than the water of a man-child in any of my investigations.â€

â€œWhat, little boysâ€™ piss?â€ she said, diverted. He let his hands relax but kept them on her shoulders.

â€œCertainly. Itâ€™s the purest water one can find. Collecting it is something of a chore, mind youâ€â€”she smiled at that; goodâ€”â€œbut the process does not the slightest harm to the infant, who will eject the water whether anyone has a use for it or not.â€

â€œOh.â€ She was beginning to relax a little, but her hands were still pressed protectively over her belly, as though she felt the imminent child already. Not yet, he thought, pulling her against him and feeling his way gently into her body. But soon! He wondered if he should remain with her until it happened; the idea of feeling it as it happened inside herâ€”to be an intimate witness to the creation of life itself! But there was no telling how long it might take. From the progress of his animalcula, it could be a day, even two.

Magic, indeed.

Why do men never think of that? he wondered. Most menâ€”himself includedâ€”regarded the engendering of babies as necessity, in the case of inheritance, or nuisance, but this â€¦ But then, most men would never know what he now knew or see what he had seen.

Madeleine had begun to relax against him, her hands at last leaving her belly. He kissed her, with a real feeling of affection.

â€œIt will be beautiful,â€ he whispered to her. â€œAnd once you are well and truly with child, I will buy your contract from Fabienne and take you away. I will buy you a house.â€

â€œA house?â€ Her eyes went round. They were green, a deep, clear emerald, and he smiled at her again, stepping back.

â€œOf course. Now, go and sleep, my dear. I shall come again tomorrow.â€

She flung her arms around him, and he had some difficulty in extracting himself, laughing, from her embraces. Normally he left a whoreâ€™s bed with no feeling save physical relief. But what he had done had made a connection with Madeleine that he had not experienced with any woman save MÃ©lisande.

MÃ©lisande. A sudden thought ran through him like the spark from a Leyden jar. MÃ©lisande.

He looked hard at Madeleine, now crawling happily naked and white-rumped into bed, her wrapper thrown aside. That bottom â€¦ the eyes, the soft blond hair, the gold-white of fresh cream.

â€œChÃ©rie,â€ he said, as casually as he might, pulling on his breeches, â€œhow old are you?â€

â€œEighteen,â€ she said, without hesitation. â€œWhy, monsieur?â€

â€œAh. A wonderful age to become a mother.â€ He pulled the shirt over his head and kissed his hand to her, relieved. He had known MÃ©lisande Robicheaux in 1744. He had not, in fact, just committed incest with his own daughter.

It was only as he passed Madame Fabienneâ€™s parlor on his way out that it occurred to him that Madeleine might possibly still be his granddaughter. That thought stopped him short, but he had no time to dwell on it, for Fabienne appeared in the doorway and motioned to him.

â€œA message, monsieur,â€ she said, and something in her voice touched his nape with a cold finger.

â€œYes?â€

â€œMaÃ®tre Grenouille begs the favor of your company at midnight tomorrow. In the square before Notre Dame de Paris.â€

* * *

They didnâ€™t have to practice custody of the eyes in the market. In fact, Sister Georgeâ€”the stout nun who oversaw these expeditions, warned them in no uncertain terms to keep a sharp eye out for short weight and uncivil prices, to say nothing of pickpockets.

â€œPickpockets, Sister?â€ Mercy had said, her blond eyebrows all but vanishing into her veil. â€œBut we are nunsâ€”more or less,â€ she added hastily. â€œWe have nothing to steal!â€

Sister Georgeâ€™s big red face got somewhat redder, but she kept her patience.

â€œNormally that would be true,â€ she agreed. â€œBut weâ€”or I, ratherâ€”have the money with which to buy our food, and once weâ€™ve bought it, you will be carrying it. A pickpocket steals to eat, nâ€™est-ce pas? They donâ€™t care whether you have money or food, and most of them are so depraved that they would willingly steal from God himself, let alone a couple of chick-headed postulants.â€

For Joanâ€™s part, she wanted to see everything, pickpockets included. To her delight, the market was the one sheâ€™d passed with Michael on her first day in Paris. True, the sight of it brought back the horrors and doubts of that first day, tooâ€”but, for the moment, she pushed those aside and followed Sister George into the fascinating maelstrom of color, smells, and shouting.

Filing away a particularly entertaining expression that she planned to make Sister PhilomÃ¨ne explain to herâ€”Sister PhilomÃ¨ne was a little older than Joan, but painfully shy and with such delicate skin that she blushed like an apple at the least excuseâ€”she followed Sister George and Sister Mathilde through the fishmongerâ€™s section, where Sister George bargained shrewdly for a great quantity of sand dabs, scallops, tiny gray translucent shrimp, and an enormous sea salmon, the pale spring light shifting through its scales in colors that faded so subtly from pink to blue to silver and back that some of them had no name at allâ€”so beautiful even in its death that it made Joan catch her breath with joy at the wonder of creation.

â€œOh, bouillabaisse tonight!â€ said Mercy, under her breath. â€œDÃ©licieuse!â€

â€œWhat is bouillabaisse?â€ Joan whispered back.

â€œFish stewâ€”youâ€™ll like it, I promise!â€ Joan had no doubt of it; brought up in the Highlands during the poverty-stricken years following the Rising, sheâ€™d been staggered by the novelty, deliciousness, and sheer abundance of the conventâ€™s food. Even on Fridays, when the community fasted during the day, supper was simple but mouthwatering, toasted sharp cheese on nutty brown bread with sliced apples.

Luckily, the salmon was so huge that Sister George arranged for the fish seller to deliver it to the convent, along with the other briny purchases; thus they had room in their baskets for fresh vegetables and fruit and so passed from Neptuneâ€™s realm to that of Demeter. Joan hoped it wasnâ€™t sacrilegious to think of Greek gods, but she couldnâ€™t forget the book of myths that Da had read to Marsali and her when they were young, with wonderful hand-colored illustrations.

After all, she told herself, you needed to know about the Greeks if you studied medicine. She had some trepidation at the thought of working in the hospital, but God called people to do things, and if it was his will, thenâ€”

The thought stopped short as she caught sight of a neat dark tricorne with a curled blue feather bobbing slowly through the tide of people. Was itâ€”it was! LÃ©onie, the sister of Michael Murrayâ€™s dead wife. Moved by curiosity, Joan glanced at Sister George, who was engrossed in a huge display of fungusâ€”dear God, people ate such things?â€”and slipped around a barrow billowing with green sallet herbs.

She meant to speak to LÃ©onie, ask her to tell Michael that she needed to talk to him. Perhaps he could contrive a way to visit the convent â€¦ But before Joan could get close enough, LÃ©onie looked furtively over her shoulder, as though fearing discovery, then ducked behind a curtain that hung across the back of a small caravan.

Joan had seen gypsies before, though not often. A dark-skinned man loitered nearby, talking with a group of others; their eyes passed over her habit without pausing, and she sighed with relief. Being a nun was as good as having a cloak of invisibility in most circumstances, she thought.

She looked round for her companions and saw that Sister Mathilde had been called into consultation regarding a big warty lump of something that looked like the excrement of a seriously diseased hog. Good, she could wait for a minute longer.

In fact, it took very little more than that before LÃ©onie slipped out from behind the curtain, tucking something into the small basket on her arm. For the first time, it struck Joan as unusual that someone like LÃ©onie should be shopping without a servant to push back crowds and carry purchasesâ€”or even be in a public market. Michael had told her about his own household during the voyageâ€”how Madame Hortense, the cook, went to the markets at dawn to be sure of getting the freshest things. What would a lady like LÃ©onie be buying, alone?

Joan slithered as best she could through the rows of stalls and wagons, following the bobbing blue feather. A sudden stop allowed her to come up behind LÃ©onie, who had paused by a flower stall, fingering a bunch of white jonquils.

It occurred suddenly to Joan that she had no idea what LÃ©onieâ€™s last name was, but she couldnâ€™t worry about politeness now.

â€œAh â€¦ madame?â€ she said tentatively. â€œMademoiselle, I mean?â€ LÃ©onie swung round, eyes huge and face pale. Finding herself faced with a nun, she blinked, confused.

â€œEr â€¦ itâ€™s me,â€ Joan said, diffident, resisting the impulse to pull off her veil. â€œJoan MacKimmie?â€ It felt odd to say it, as though â€œJoan MacKimmieâ€ were truly someone else. It took a moment for the name to register, but then LÃ©onieâ€™s shoulders relaxed a little.

â€œOh.â€ She put a hand to her bosom and mustered a small smile. â€œMichaelâ€™s cousin. Of course. I didnâ€™t â€¦ er â€¦ How nice to see you!â€ A small frown wrinkled the skin between her brows. â€œAre you â€¦ alone?â€

â€œNo,â€ Joan said hurriedly. â€œAnd I mustnâ€™t stop. I only saw you, and I wanted to askâ€”â€ It seemed even stupider than it had a moment ago, but no help for it. â€œWould you tell Monsieur Murray that I must talk to him? I know somethingâ€”something importantâ€”that I have to tell him.â€

â€œSoeur Gregory?â€ Sister Georgeâ€™s stentorian tones boomed through the higher-pitched racket of the market, making Joan jump. She could see the top of Sister Mathildeâ€™s head, with its great white sails, turning to and fro in vain search.

â€œI have to go,â€ she said to the astonished LÃ©onie. â€œPlease. Please tell him!â€ Her heart was pounding, and not only from the sudden meeting. Sheâ€™d been looking at LÃ©onieâ€™s basket, where she caught the glint of a brown glass bottle half hidden beneath a thick bunch of what even Joan recognized as black hellebores. Lovely cup-shaped flowers of an eerie greenish-whiteâ€”and deadly poison.

She dodged back across the market to arrive breathless and apologizing at Sister Mathildeâ€™s side, wondering if â€¦ She hadnâ€™t spent much time at all with Daâ€™s wifeâ€”but she had heard her talking with Da as she wrote down receipts in a book, and sheâ€™d mentioned black hellebore as something women used to make themselves miscarry. If LÃ©onie were pregnant â€¦ Holy Mother of God, could she be with child by Michael? The thought struck her like a blow in the stomach.

No. No, she couldnâ€™t believe it. He was still in love with his wife, anyone could see that, and even if not, sheâ€™d swear he wasnâ€™t the sort to â€¦ But what did she ken about men, after all?

Well, sheâ€™d ask him when she saw him, she decided, her mouth clamping tight. And â€™til then â€¦ Her hand went to the rosary at her waist and she said a quick, silent prayer for LÃ©onie. Just in case.

As she was bargaining doggedly in her execrable French for six aubergines (wondering meanwhile what on earth they were for, medicine or food?), she became aware of someone standing at her elbow. A handsome man of middle age, taller than she was, in a well-cut dove-gray coat. He smiled at her and, touching one of the peculiar vegetables, said in slow, simple French, â€œYou donâ€™t want the big ones. Theyâ€™re tough. Get small ones, like that.â€ A long finger tapped an aubergine half the size of the ones the vegetable seller had been urging on her, and the vegetable seller burst into a tirade of abuse that made Joan step back, blinking.

Not so much because of the expressions being hurled at herâ€”she didnâ€™t understand one word in tenâ€”but because a voice in plain English had just said clearly, â€œTell him not to do it.â€

She felt hot and cold at the same time.

â€œI â€¦ er â€¦ je suis â€¦ um â€¦ merci beaucoup, monsieur!â€ she blurted, and, turning, ran, scrambling back between piles of paper narcissus bulbs and fragrant spikes of hyacinth, her shoes skidding on the slime of trodden leaves.

â€œSoeur Gregory!â€ Sister Mathilde loomed up so suddenly in front of her that she nearly ran into the massive nun. â€œWhat are you doing? Where is Sister MisÃ©ricorde?â€

â€œI â€¦ oh.â€ Joan swallowed, gathering her wits. â€œSheâ€™sâ€”over there.â€ She spoke with relief, spotting Mercyâ€™s small head in the forefront of a crowd by the meat-pie wagon. â€œIâ€™ll get her!â€ she blurted, and walked hastily off before Sister Mathilde could say more.

â€œTell him not to do it.â€ Thatâ€™s what the voice had said about Charles PÃ©pin. What was going on? she thought wildly. Was M. PÃ©pin engaged in something awful with the man in the dove-gray coat?

As though thought of the man had reminded the voice, it came again.

â€œTell him not to do it,â€ the voice repeated in her head, with what seemed like particular urgency. â€œTell him he must not!â€

â€œHail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women â€¦â€ Joan clutched at her rosary and gabbled the words, feeling the blood leave her face. There he was, the man in the dove-gray coat, looking curiously at her over a stall of Dutch tulips and sprays of yellow forsythia.

She couldnâ€™t feel the pavement under her feet but was moving toward him. I have to, she thought. It doesnâ€™t matter if he thinks Iâ€™m mad.â€¦

â€œDonâ€™t do it,â€ she blurted, coming face-to-face with the astonished gentleman. â€œYou mustnâ€™t do it!â€

And then she turned and ran, rosary in hand, apron and veil flapping like wings.

* * *

He couldnâ€™t help thinking of the cathedral as an entity. An immense version of one of its own gargoyles, crouched over the city. In protection or threat?

Notre Dame de Paris rose black above him, solid, obliterating the light of the stars, the beauty of the night. Very appropriate. Heâ€™d always thought that the church blocked oneâ€™s sight of God. Nonetheless, the sight of the monstrous stone creature made him shiver as he passed under its shadow, despite the warm cloak.

Perhaps it was the cathedralâ€™s stones themselves that gave him the sense of menace? He stopped, paused for a heartbeat, and then strode up to the churchâ€™s wall and pressed his palm flat against the cold limestone. There was no immediate sense of anything, just the cold roughness of the rock. Impulsively, he shut his eyes and tried to feel his way into the rock. At first, nothing. But he waited, pressing with his mind, a repeated question. Are you there?

He would have been terrified to receive an answer but was obscurely disappointed not to. Even so, when he finally opened his eyes and took his hands away, he saw a trace of blue light, the barest trace, glowing briefly between his knuckles. That frightened him, and he hurried away, hiding his hands beneath the shelter of the cloak.

Surely not, he assured himself. Heâ€™d done that before, made the light happen when he held the jewels he used for travel and said the words over themâ€”his own version of consecration, he supposed. He didnâ€™t know if the words were necessary, but MÃ©lisande had used them; he was afraid not to. And yet. He had felt something here. The sense of something heavy, inert. Nothing resembling thought, let alone speech, thank God. By reflex, he crossed himself, then shook his head, rattled and irritated.

But something. Something immense and very old. Did God have the voice of a stone? He was further unsettled by the thought. The stones there in the chalk mine, the noise they madeâ€”was it after all God that heâ€™d glimpsed, there in that space between?

A movement in the shadows banished all such thoughts in an instant. The frog! Rakoczyâ€™s heart clenched like a fist.

â€œMonsieur le Comte,â€ said an amused, gravelly voice. â€œI see the years have been kind to you.â€

Raymond stepped into the starlight, smiling. The sight of him was disconcerting; Rakoczy had imagined this meeting for so long that the reality seemed oddly anticlimactic. Short, broad-shouldered, with long, loose hair that swept back from a massive forehead. A broad, almost lipless mouth. Raymond the frog.

â€œWhy are you here?â€ Rakoczy blurted.

MaÃ®tre Raymondâ€™s brows were blackâ€”surely they had been white thirty years ago? One of them lifted in puzzlement.

â€œI was told that you were looking for me, monsieur.â€ He spread his hands, the gesture graceful. â€œI came!â€

â€œThank you,â€ Rakoczy said dryly, beginning to regain some composure. â€œI meantâ€”why are you in Paris?â€

â€œEveryone has to be somewhere, donâ€™t they? They canâ€™t be in the same place.â€ This should have sounded like badinage but didnâ€™t. It sounded serious, like a statement of scientific principle, and Rakoczy found it unsettling.

â€œDid you come looking for me?â€ he asked boldly. He moved a little, trying to get a better view of the man. He was nearly sure that the frog appeared younger than he had when last seen. Surely his flowing hair was darker, his step more elastic? A spurt of excitement bubbled in his chest.

â€œFor you?â€ The frog seemed amused for a moment, but then the look faded. â€œNo. Iâ€™m searching for a lost daughter.â€

Rakoczy was surprised and disconcerted.

â€œYours?â€

â€œMore or less.â€ Raymond seemed uninterested in explaining further. He moved a little to one side, eyes narrowing as he sought to make out Rakoczyâ€™s face in the darkness. â€œYou can hear stones, then, can you?â€

â€œIâ€”what?â€

Raymond nodded at the faÃ§ade of the cathedral. â€œThey do speak. They move, too, but very slowly.â€

An icy chill shot up Rakoczyâ€™s spine at the thought of the grinning gargoyles perched high above him and the implication that one might at any moment choose to spread its silent wings and hurtle down upon him, teeth still bared in carnivorous hilarity. Despite himself, he looked up, over his shoulder.

â€œNot that fast.â€ The note of amusement was back in the frogâ€™s voice. â€œYou would never see them. It takes them millennia to move the slightest fraction of an inchâ€”unless of course they are propelled or melted. But you donâ€™t want to see them do that, of course. Much too dangerous.â€

This kind of talk struck him as frivolous, and Rakoczy was bothered by it but for some reason not irritated. Troubled, with a sense that there was something under it, something that he simultaneously wanted to knowâ€”and wanted very much to avoid knowing. The sensation was novel, and unpleasant.

He cast caution to the wind and demanded boldly, â€œWhy did you not kill me?â€

Raymond grinned at him; Rakoczy could see the flash of teeth and felt yet another shock: he was sureâ€”almost sureâ€”that the frog had had no teeth when last seen.

â€œIf I had wanted you dead, son, you wouldnâ€™t be here talking to me,â€ he said. â€œI wanted you to be out of the way, thatâ€™s all; you obliged me by taking the hint.â€

â€œAnd just why did you want me â€˜out of the wayâ€™?â€ Had he not needed to find out, Rakcozy would have taken offense at the manâ€™s tone.

The frog lifted one shoulder.

â€œYou were something of a threat to the lady.â€

Sheer astonishment brought Rakoczy to his full height.

â€œThe lady? You mean the womanâ€”La Dame Blanche?â€

â€œThey did call her that.â€ The frog seemed to find the notion amusing.

It was on the tip of Rakoczyâ€™s tongue to tell Raymond that La Dame Blanche still lived, but he hadnâ€™t lived as long as he had by blurting out everything he knewâ€”and he didnâ€™t want Raymond thinking that he himself might be still a threat to her.

â€œWhat is the ultimate goal of an alchemist?â€ the frog said very seriously.

â€œTo transform matter,â€ Rakoczy replied automatically.

The frogâ€™s face split in a broad amphibian grin.

â€œExactly!â€ he said. And vanished.

He had vanished. No puffs of smoke, no illusionistâ€™s tricks, no smell of sulfurâ€”the frog was simply gone. The square stretched empty under the starlit sky; the only thing that moved was a cat that darted mewing out of the shadows and brushed past Rakoczyâ€™s leg.

* * *

Worn out with constant walking, Michael slept like the dead these days, without dreams or motion, and woke when the sun came up. His valet, Robert, heard him stir and came in at once, one of the femmes de chambre on his heels with a bowl of coffee and some pastry.

He ate slowly, suffering himself to be brushed, shaved, and tenderly tidied into fresh linen. Robert kept up a soothing murmur of the sort of conversation that doesnâ€™t require response and smiled encouragingly when presenting the mirror. Rather to Michaelâ€™s surprise, the image in the mirror looked quite normal. Hair neatly clubbedâ€”he wore his own, without powderâ€”suit modest in cut but of the highest quality. Robert hadnâ€™t asked him what he required but had dressed him for an ordinary day of business. He supposed that was all right. What, after all, did clothes matter? It wasnâ€™t as though there was a costume de rigueur for calling upon the sister of oneâ€™s deceased wife, who had come uninvited into oneâ€™s bed in the middle of the night.

He had spent the last two days trying to think of some way never to see or speak to LÃ©onie again, but, really, there was no help for it. Heâ€™d have to see her.

But what was he to say to her, he wondered, as he made his way through the streets toward the house where LÃ©onie lived with an aged aunt, Eugenie Galantine. He wished he could talk the situation over with Sister Joan, but that wouldnâ€™t be appropriate, even were she available.

Heâ€™d hoped that walking would give him time to come up at least with a point dâ€™appui, if not an entire statement of principle, but instead he found himself obsessively counting the flagstones of the market as he crossed it, counting the bongs of the public horologe as it struck the hour of three, andâ€”for lack of anything elseâ€”counting his own footsteps as he approached her door. Six hundred and thirty-seven, six hundred and thirty-eight â€¦

As he turned into the street, though, he abruptly stopped counting. He stopped walking, too, for an instantâ€”then began to run. Something was wrong at the house of Madame Galantine.

He pushed his way through the crowd of neighbors and vendors clustered near the steps and seized the butler, whom he knew, by a sleeve.

â€œWhat?â€ he barked. â€œWhatâ€™s happened?â€ The butler, a tall, cadaverous man named Hubert, was plainly agitated but settled a bit on seeing Michael.

â€œI donâ€™t know, sir,â€ he said, though a sideways slide of his eyes made it clear that he did. â€œMademoiselle LÃ©onie â€¦ sheâ€™s ill. The doctor â€¦â€

He could smell the blood. Not waiting for more, he pushed Hubert aside and sprinted up the stairs, calling for Madame Eugenie, LÃ©onieâ€™s aunt.

Madame Eugenie popped out of a bedroom, her cap and wrapper neat in spite of the uproar.

â€œMonsieur Michel!â€ she said, blocking him from entering the room. â€œItâ€™s all right, but you must not go in.â€

â€œYes, I must.â€ His heart was thundering in his ears, and his hands felt cold.

â€œYou may not,â€ she said firmly. â€œSheâ€™s ill. It isnâ€™t proper.â€

â€œProper? A young woman tries to make away with herself and you tell me it isnâ€™t proper?â€

A maid appeared in the doorway, a basket piled with bloodstained linen in her arms, but the look of shock on Madame Eugenieâ€™s broad face was more striking.

â€œMake away with herself?â€ The old ladyâ€™s mouth hung open for a moment, then snapped shut like a turtleâ€™s. â€œWhy would you think such a thing?â€ She was regarding him with considerable suspicion. â€œAnd what are you doing here, for that matter? Who told you she was ill?â€

A glimpse of a man in a dark robe, who must be the doctor, decided Michael that little was to be gained by engaging further with Madame Eugenie. He took her gently but firmly by the elbows, picked her upâ€”she uttered a small shriek of surpriseâ€”and set her aside.

He went in and shut the bedroom door behind him.

â€œWho are you?â€ The doctor looked up, surprised. He was wiping out a freshly used bleeding-bowl, and his case lay open on the boudoirâ€™s settee. LÃ©onieâ€™s bedroom must lie beyond; the door was open, and Michael caught a glimpse of the foot of a bed but could not see the bedâ€™s inhabitant.

â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter. How is she?â€

The doctor eyed him narrowly, but after a moment nodded.

â€œShe will live. As for the child â€¦â€ He made an equivocal motion of the hand. â€œIâ€™ve done my best. She took a great deal of theâ€”â€

â€œThe child?â€ The floor shifted under his feet, and the dream of the night before flooded him, that queer sense of something half wrong, half familiar. It was the feeling of a small, hard swelling pressed against his bum; thatâ€™s what it was. Lillie had not been far gone with child when she died, but he remembered all too well the feeling of a womanâ€™s body in early pregnancy.

â€œItâ€™s yours? I beg your pardon, I shouldnâ€™t ask.â€ The doctor put away his bowl and fleam and shook out his black velvet turban.

â€œI wantâ€”I need to talk to her. Now.â€

The doctor opened his mouth in automatic protest but then glanced thoughtfully over his shoulder.

â€œWell â€¦ you must be careful not toâ€”â€ But Michael was already inside the bedroom, standing by the bed.

She was pale. They had always been pale, Lillie and LÃ©onie, with the soft glow of cream and marble. This was the paleness of a frogâ€™s belly, of a rotting fish, blanched on the shore.

Her eyes were ringed with black, sunk in her head. They rested on his face, flat, expressionless, as still as the ringless hands that lay limp on the coverlet.

â€œWho?â€ he said quietly. â€œCharles?â€

â€œYes.â€ Her voice was as dull as her eyes, and he wondered whether the doctor had drugged her.

â€œWas it his ideaâ€”to try to foist the child off on me? Or yours?â€

She did look away then, and her throat moved.

â€œHis.â€ The eyes came back to him. â€œI didnâ€™t want to, Michel. Notâ€”not that I find you disgusting, not that â€¦â€

â€œMerci,â€ he muttered, but she went on, disregarding him.

â€œYou were Lillieâ€™s husband. I didnâ€™t envy her you,â€ she said frankly, â€œbut I envied what you had together. It couldnâ€™t be like that between you and me, and I didnâ€™t like betraying her. Butâ€â€”her lips, already pale, compressed to invisibilityâ€”â€œI didnâ€™t have much choice.â€

He was obliged to admit that she hadnâ€™t. Charles couldnâ€™t marry her; he had a wife. Bearing an illegitimate child was not a fatal scandal in high court circles, but the Galantines were of the emerging bourgeoisie, where respectability counted for almost as much as money. Finding herself pregnant, she would have had two alternatives: find a complaisant husband quickly, or â€¦ He tried not to see that one of her hands rested lightly across the slight swell of her stomach.

The child â€¦ He wondered what he would have done had she come to him and told him the truth, asked him to marry her for the sake of the child. But she hadnâ€™t. And she wasnâ€™t asking now.

It would be bestâ€”or at least easiestâ€”were she to lose the child. And she might yet.

â€œI couldnâ€™t wait, you see,â€ she said, as though continuing a conversation. â€œI would have tried to find someone else, but I thought she knew. Sheâ€™d tell you as soon as she could manage to see you. So I had to, you see, before you found out.â€

â€œShe? Who? Tell me what?â€

â€œThe nun,â€ LÃ©onie said, and sighed deeply, as though losing interest. â€œShe saw me in the market and rushed up to me. She said she had to talk to youâ€”that she had something important to tell you. I saw her look into my basket, though, and her face â€¦ thought she must realize â€¦â€

Her eyelids were fluttering, whether from drugs or fatigue, he couldnâ€™t tell. She smiled faintly, but not at him; she seemed to be looking at something a long way off.

â€œSo funny,â€ she murmured. â€œCharles said it would solve everythingâ€”that the comte would pay him such a lot for her, it would solve everything. But how can you solve a baby?â€

Michael jerked as though her words had stabbed him.

â€œWhat? Pay for whom?â€

â€œThe nun.â€

He grabbed her by the shoulders.

â€œSister Joan? What do you mean, pay for her? What did Charles tell you?â€

She made a whiny sound of protest. Michael wanted to shake her hard enough to break her neck but forced himself to withdraw his hand. She settled into the pillow like a bladder losing air, flattening under the bedclothes. Her eyes were closed, but he bent down, speaking directly into her ear.

â€œThe comte, LÃ©onie. What is his name? Tell me his name.â€

A faint frown rippled the flesh of her brow, then passed.

â€œSt. Germain,â€ she murmured, scarcely loud enough to be heard. â€œThe Comte St. Germain.â€

* * *

He went instantly to Rosenwald and, by dint of badgering and the promise of extra payment, got him to finish the engraving on the chalice at once. Michael waited impatiently while it was done and, scarcely pausing for the cup and paten to be wrapped in brown paper, flung money to the goldsmith and made for les Couvent des Anges, almost running.

With great difficulty, he restrained himself while making the presentation of the chalice, and with great humility, he inquired whether he might ask the great favor of seeing Sister Gregory, that he might convey a message to her from her family in the Highlands. Sister Eustacia looked surprised and somewhat disapprovingâ€”postulants were not normally permitted visitsâ€”but after all â€¦ in view of Monsieur Murrayâ€™s and Monsieur Fraserâ€™s great generosity to the convent â€¦ perhaps just a few moments, in the visitorâ€™s parlor, and in the presence of Sister herself â€¦

* * *

He turned and blinked once, his mouth opening a little. He looked shocked. Did she look so different in her robe and veil?

â€œItâ€™s me,â€ Joan said, and tried to smile reassuringly. â€œI mean â€¦ still me.â€

His eyes fixed on her face, and he let out a deep breath and smiled, as if sheâ€™d been lost and heâ€™d found her again.

â€œAye, so it is,â€ he said softly. â€œI was afraid it was Sister Gregory. I mean, the â€¦ er â€¦â€ He made a sketchy, awkward gesture indicating her gray robes and white postulantâ€™s veil.

â€œItâ€™s only clothes,â€ she said, and put a hand to her chest, defensive.

â€œWell, no,â€ he said, looking her over carefully, â€œI dinna think it is, quite. Itâ€™s more like a soldierâ€™s uniform, no? Yeâ€™re doing your job when ye wear it, and everybody as sees it kens what ye are and knows what ye do.â€

Kens what I am. I suppose I should be pleased it doesnâ€™t show, she thought, a little wildly.

â€œWell.â€¦ aye, I suppose.â€ She fingered the rosary at her belt. She coughed. â€œIn a way, at least.â€

Yeâ€™ve got to tell him. It wasnâ€™t one of the voices, just the voice of her own conscience, but that was demanding enough. She could feel her heart beating, so hard that she thought the bumping must show through the front of her habit.

He smiled encouragingly at her.

â€œLÃ©onie told me ye wanted to see me.â€

â€œMichael â€¦ can I tell ye something?â€ she blurted.

He seemed surprised. â€œWell, of course ye can,â€ he said. â€œWhyever not?â€

â€œWhyever not,â€ she said, half under her breath. She glanced over his shoulder, but Sister Eustacia was on the far side of the room, talking to a very young, frightened-looking French girl and her parents.

â€œWell, itâ€™s like this, see,â€ she said, in a determined voice. â€œI hear voices.â€

She stole a look at him, but he didnâ€™t appear shocked. Not yet.

â€œIn my head, I mean.â€

â€œAye?â€ He sounded cautious. â€œUm â€¦ what do they say, then?â€

She realized she was holding her breath, and let a little of it out.

â€œAh â€¦ different things. But they now and then tell me somethingâ€™s going to happen. More often, they tell me I should say thus-and-so to someone.â€

â€œThus-and-so,â€ he repeated attentively, watching her face. â€œWhat â€¦ sort of thus-and-so?â€

â€œI wasna expecting the Spanish Inquisition,â€ she said, a little testily. â€œDoes it matter?â€

His mouth twitched.

â€œWell, I dinna ken, now, do I?â€ he pointed out. â€œIt might give a clue as to whoâ€™s talkinâ€™ to ye, might it not? Or do ye already know that?â€

â€œNo, I donâ€™t,â€ she admitted, and felt a sudden lessening of tension. â€œIâ€”I was worritâ€”a bitâ€”that it might be demons. But it doesna really â€¦ well, they dinna tell me wicked sorts of things. Just â€¦ more like when somethingâ€™s going to happen to a person. And sometimes itâ€™s no a good thingâ€”but sometimes it is. There was wee Annie MacLaren, her wiâ€™ a big belly by the third month, and by six lookinâ€™ as though sheâ€™d burst, and she was frightened she was goinâ€™ to die come her time, like her ain mother did, wiâ€™ a babe too big to be bornâ€”I mean, really frightened, not just like all women are. And I met her by St. Ninianâ€™s Spring one day, and one of the voices said to me, â€˜Tell her it will be as God wills and she will be delivered safely of a son.â€™ â€

â€œAnd ye did tell her that?â€

â€œYes. I didna say how I knew, but I must have sounded like I did know, because her poor face got bright all of a sudden, and she grabbed on to my hands and said, â€˜Oh! From your lips to Godâ€™s ear!â€™ â€

â€œAnd was she safely delivered of a son?â€

â€œAyeâ€”and a daughter, too.â€ Joan smiled, remembering the glow on Annieâ€™s face.

Michael glanced aside at Sister Eustacia, who was bidding farewell to the new postulantâ€™s family. The girl was white-faced and tears ran down her cheeks, but she clung to Sister Eustaciaâ€™s sleeve as though it were a lifeline.

â€œI see,â€ he said slowly, and looked back at Joan. â€œIs that whyâ€”is it the voices told ye to be a nun, then?â€

She blinked, surprised by his apparent acceptance of what sheâ€™d told him but more so by the question.

â€œWell â€¦ no. They never did. Yeâ€™d think they would have, wouldnâ€™t ye?â€

He smiled a little.

â€œMaybe so.â€ He coughed, then looked up, a little shyly. â€œItâ€™s no my business, but what did make ye want to be a nun?â€

She hesitated, but why not? Sheâ€™d already told him the hardest bit.

â€œBecause of the voices. I thought maybeâ€”maybe I wouldna hear them in here. Or â€¦ if I still did, maybe somebodyâ€”a priest, maybe?â€”could tell me what they were and what I should do about them.â€

Sister Eustacia was comforting the new girl, half-sunk on one knee to bring her big, homely, sweet face close to the girlâ€™s. Michael glanced at them, then back at Joan, one eyebrow raised.

â€œIâ€™m guessing ye havena told anyone yet,â€ he said. â€œDid ye reckon yeâ€™d practice on me first?â€

Her own mouth twitched.

â€œMaybe.â€ His eyes were dark but had a sort of warmth to them, as if they drew it from the heat of his hair. She looked down; her hands were pleating the edge of her blouse, which had come untucked. â€œItâ€™s no just that, though.â€

He made the sort of noise in his throat that meant, â€œAye, then, go on.â€ Why didnâ€™t French people do like that? she wondered. So much easier. But she pushed the thought aside; sheâ€™d made up her mind to tell him, and now was the time to do it.

â€œI told ye becauseâ€”that man,â€ she blurted. â€œThe Comte.â€ He squinted at her. â€œThe Comte St. Germain?â€

â€œWell, I dinna ken his name, now, do I?â€ she snapped. â€œBut when I saw him, one of the voices pops up and says to me, â€˜Tell him not to do it. Tell him he must not.â€™ â€

â€œIt did?â€

â€œAye, and it was verra firm about it. I meanâ€”they are, usually. Itâ€™s no just an opinion, take it or leave it. But this one truly meant it.â€ She spread her hands, helpless to explain the feeling of dread and urgency. She swallowed.

â€œAnd then â€¦ your friend. Monsieur PÃ©pin. The first time I saw him, one oâ€™ the voices said â€˜Tell him not to do it.â€™ â€

Michaelâ€™s thick red eyebrows drew together.

â€œDâ€™ye think itâ€™s the same thing theyâ€™re not supposed to do?â€ He sounded startled. â€œWell, I donâ€™t know, now, do I?â€ she said, a little exasperated. â€œThe voices didnâ€™t say. But I saw that the man on the ship was going to die, and I didna say anything, because I couldnâ€™t think what to say. And then he did die, and maybe he wouldnâ€™t have if Iâ€™d spoken â€¦ so Iâ€”well, I thought Iâ€™d best say something to someone.â€

He thought about that for a moment, then nodded uncertainly.

â€œAye. All right. Iâ€™llâ€”well, I dinna ken what to do about it, either, to be honest. But Iâ€™ll talk to them both and Iâ€™ll have that in my mind, so maybe Iâ€™ll think of something. Dâ€™ye want me to tell them, â€˜Donâ€™t do itâ€™?â€

She grimaced and looked at Sister Eustacia. There wasnâ€™t much time.

â€œI already told the comte. Just â€¦ maybe. If ye think it might help. Nowâ€”â€ Her hand darted under her apron and she passed him the slip of paper, fast. â€œWeâ€™re only allowed to write to our families twice a year,â€ she said, lowering her voice. â€œBut I wanted Mam to know I was all right. Could ye see she gets that, please? And â€¦ and maybe tell her a bit, yourself, that Iâ€™m weel andâ€”and happy. Tell her Iâ€™m happy,â€ she repeated, more firmly.

Sister Eustacia was now standing by the door, emanating an intent to come and tell them it was time for Michael to leave.

â€œI will,â€ he said. He couldnâ€™t touch her, he knew that, so bowed instead and bowed deeply to Sister Eustacia, who came toward them, looking benevolent.

â€œIâ€™ll come to Mass at the chapel on Sundays, howâ€™s that?â€ he said rapidly. â€œIf Iâ€™ve a letter from your mam, or ye have to speak to me, gie me a wee roll of the eyes or somethingâ€”Iâ€™ll figure something out.â€

* * *

Twenty-four hours later, Sister Gregory, postulant in the Convent of Angels, regarded the bum of a large cow. The cow in question was named Mirabeau and was of uncertain temper, as evidenced by the nervously lashing tail.

â€œSheâ€™s kicked three of us this week,â€ said Sister Anne-Joseph, eyeing the cow resentfully. â€œAnd spilt the milk twice. Sister Jeanne-Marie was most upset.â€

â€œWell, we canna have that, now, can we?â€ Joan murmured in English. â€œNâ€™inquiÃ©tez-vous pas,â€ she added in French, hoping that was at least somewhat grammatical. â€œLet me do it.â€

â€œBetter you than me,â€ Sister Anne-Joseph said, crossing herself, and vanished before Sister Joan might think better of the offer.

A week spent working in the cowshed was intended as punishment for her flighty behavior in the marketplace, but Joan was grateful for it. There was nothing better for steadying the nerves than cows.

Granted, the conventâ€™s cows were not quite like her motherâ€™s sweet-tempered, shaggy red Hieland coos, but if you came right down to it, a cow was a cow, and even a French-speaking wee besom like the present Mirabeau was no match for Joan MacKimmie, whoâ€™d driven kine to and from the shielings for years and fed her motherâ€™s kine in the byre beside the house with sweet hay and the leavings from supper.

With that in mind, she circled Mirabeau thoughtfully, eyeing the steadily champing jaws and the long slick of blackish-green drool that hung down from slack pink lips. She nodded once, slipped out of the cowshed, and made her way down the allÃ©e behind it, picking what she could find. Mirabeau, presented with a bouquet of fresh grasses, tiny daisies, andâ€”delicacy of all delicaciesâ€”fresh sorrel, bulged her eyes half out of her head, opened her massive jaw, and inhaled the sweet stuff. The ominous tail ceased its lashing and the massive creature stood as if turned to stone, aside from the ecstatically grinding jaws.

Joan sighed in satisfaction, sat down, and, resting her head on Mirabeauâ€™s monstrous flank, got down to business. Her mind, released, took up the next worry of the day.

Had Michael spoken to his friend PÃ©pin? And if so, had he told him what sheâ€™d said, or just asked whether he kent the Comte St. Germain? Because if â€œtell him not to do itâ€ referred to the same thing, then plainly the two men must be acquent with each other.

She had got thus far in her own ruminations when Mirabeauâ€™s tail began to switch again. She hurriedly stripped the last of the milk from Mirabeauâ€™s teats and snatched the bucket out of the way, standing up in a hurry. Then she saw what had disturbed the cow.

The man in the dove-gray coat was standing in the door to the shed, watching her. She hadnâ€™t noticed before, in the market, but he had a handsome dark face, though rather hard about the eyes, and with a chin that brooked no opposition. He smiled pleasantly at her, though, and bowed.

â€œMademoiselle. I must ask you, please, to come with me.â€

* * *

Michael was in the warehouse, stripped to his shirtsleeves and sweating in the hot, wine-heady atmosphere, when Jared appeared, looking disturbed.

â€œWhat is it, cousin?â€ Michael wiped his face on a towel, leaving black streaks; the crew was clearing the racks on the southeast wall, and there were years of filth and cobwebs behind the most ancient casks.

â€œYe havenâ€™t got that wee nun in your bed, have ye, Michael?â€ Jared lifted a beetling gray brow at him.

â€œHave I what?â€

â€œIâ€™ve just had a message from the Mother Superior of le Couvent des Anges, saying that one Sister Gregory appears to have been abducted from their cowshed, and wanting to know whether you might possibly have anything to do with the matter.â€

Michael stared at his cousin for a moment, unable to take this in.

â€œAbducted?â€ he said stupidly. â€œWho would be kidnapping a nun? What for?â€

â€œWell, now, there ye have me.â€ Jared was carrying Michaelâ€™s coat over his arm and at this point handed it to him. â€œBut maybe best ye go to the convent and find out.â€

* * *

â€œForgive me, Mother,â€ Michael said carefully. Mother Hildegarde looked as though a breath would make her roll across the floor, wizened as a winter apple. â€œDid ye think â€¦ is it possible that Sister Jâ€”Sister Gregory might have â€¦ left of her own accord?â€

The old nun gave him a look that revised his opinion of her state of health instantly.

â€œWe did,â€ she said dryly. â€œIt happens. Howeverâ€â€”she raised a sticklike fingerâ€”â€œone: there were signs of a considerable struggle in the cowshed. A full bucket of milk not merely spilt but apparently thrown at something, the manger overturned, the door left open, and two of the cows escaped into the herb garden.â€ Another finger. â€œTwo: had Sister Gregory experienced doubt regarding her vocation, she was quite free to leave the convent after speaking with me, and she knew that.â€

One more finger, and the old nunâ€™s black eyes bored into his. â€œAnd three: had she felt it necessary to leave suddenly and without informing us, where would she go? To you, Monsieur Murray. She knows no one else in Paris, does she?â€

â€œIâ€”well, no, not really.â€ He was flustered, almost stammering, confusion and a burgeoning alarm for Joan making it difficult to think.

â€œBut you have not seen her since you brought us the chalice and patenâ€”and I thank you and your cousin with the deepest sentiments of gratitude, monsieurâ€”which would be yesterday afternoon?â€

â€œNo.â€ He shook his head, trying to clear it. â€œNo, Mother.â€

Mother Hildegarde nodded, her lips nearly invisible, pressed together amid the lines of her face.

â€œDid she say anything to you on that occasion? Anything that might assist us in discovering her?â€

â€œIâ€”well â€¦â€ Jesus, should he tell her what Joan had said about the voices she heard? It couldnâ€™t have anything to do with this, surely, and it wasna his secret to share. On the other hand, Joan had said she meant to tell Mother Hildegarde about them â€¦

â€œYouâ€™d better tell me, my son.â€ The reverend motherâ€™s voice was somewhere between resignation and command. â€œI see she told you something.â€

â€œWell, she did, then, Mother,â€ he said, rubbing a hand over his face in distraction. â€œBut I canna see how it has anything to doâ€”she hears voices,â€ he blurted, seeing Mother Hildegardeâ€™s eyes narrow dangerously.

The eyes went round.

â€œShe what?â€

â€œVoices,â€ he said helplessly. â€œThey come and say things to her. She thinks maybe theyâ€™re angels, but she doesnâ€™t know. And she can see when folk are going to die. Sometimes,â€ he added dubiously. â€œI donâ€™t know whether she can always say.â€

â€œPar le sang sacrÃ© de JÃ©sus Christ,â€ the old nun said, sitting up straight as an oak sapling. â€œWhy did she notâ€”well, never mind about that. Does anyone else know this?â€

He shook his head. â€œShe was afraid to tell anyone. Thatâ€™s whyâ€”well, one reason whyâ€”she came to the convent. She thought you might believe her.â€

â€œI might,â€ Mother Hildegarde said dryly. She shook her head rapidly, making her veil flap. â€œNom de Dieu! Why did her mother not tell me this?â€

â€œHer mother?â€ Michael said stupidly.

â€œYes! She brought me a letter from her mother, very kind, asking after my health and recommending Joan to meâ€”but surely her mother would have known!â€

â€œI donâ€™t think sheâ€”wait.â€ He remembered Joan fishing out the carefully folded note from her pocket. â€œThe letter she broughtâ€”it was from Claire Fraser. Thatâ€™s the one you mean?â€

â€œOf course!â€

He took a deep breath, a dozen disconnected pieces falling suddenly into a pattern. He cleared his throat and raised a tentative finger.

â€œOne, Mother: Claire Fraser is the wife of Joanâ€™s stepfather. But sheâ€™s not Joanâ€™s mother.â€

The sharp black eyes blinked once.

â€œAnd two: my cousin Jared tells me that Claire Fraser was known as aâ€”a White Lady, when she lived in Paris many years ago.â€

Mother Hildegarde clicked her tongue angrily.

â€œShe was no such thing. Stuff! But it is true that there was a common rumor to that effect,â€ she admitted grudgingly. She drummed her fingers on the desk; they were knobbed with age but surprisingly nimble, and he remembered that Mother Hildegarde was a musician.

â€œMother â€¦â€

â€œYes?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know if it has anything to doâ€”do you know of a man called the Comte St. Germain?â€

The old nun was already the color of parchment; at this, she went white as bone and her fingers gripped the edge of the desk.

â€œI do,â€ she said. â€œTell meâ€”and quicklyâ€”what he has to do with Sister Gregory.â€

* * *

Joan gave the very solid door one last kick, for formâ€™s sake, then turned and collapsed with her back against it, panting. The room was huge, extending across the entire top floor of the house, though pillars and joists here and there showed where walls had been knocked down. It smelled peculiar and looked even more peculiar.

â€œBlessed Michael, protect me,â€ she whispered to herself, reverting to the Gaelic in her agitation. There was a very fancy bed in one corner, piled with feather pillows and bolsters, with writhing corner posts and heavy swags and curtains of cloth embroidered in what looked like gold and silver thread. Did the comteâ€”heâ€™d told her his name, or at least his title, when she askedâ€”haul young women up here for wicked ends on a regular basis? For surely he hadnâ€™t set up this establishment solely in anticipation of her arrivalâ€”the area near the bed was equipped with all kinds of solid, shiny furniture with marble tops and alarming gilt feet that looked like theyâ€™d come off some kind of beast or bird with great curving claws.

Heâ€™d told her in the most matter-of-fact way that he was a sorcerer, too, and not to touch anything. She crossed herself and averted her gaze from the table with the nastiest-looking feet; maybe heâ€™d charmed the furniture, and it came to life and walked round after dark. The thought made her move hastily off to the farther end of the room, rosary clutched tight in one hand.

This side of the room was scarcely less alarming, but at least it didnâ€™t look as though any of the big colored glass balls and jars and tubes could move on their own. It was where the worst smells were coming from, though: something that smelled like burnt hair and treacle, and something else very sharp that curled the hairs in your nose, like it did when someone dug out a jakes for the saltpeter. But there was a window near the long table where all this sinister stuff was laid out, and she went to this at once.

The big riverâ€”the Seine, Michael had called itâ€”was right there, and the sight of boats and people made her feel a bit steadier. She put a hand on the table to lean closer but set it on something sticky and jerked it back. She swallowed and leaned in more gingerly. The window was barred on the inside. Glancing round, she saw that all the others were, too.

What in the name of the Blessed Virgin did that man expect would try to get in? Gooseflesh raced right up the curve of her spine and spread down her arms, her imagination instantly conjuring a vision of flying demons hovering over the street in the night, beating leathery wings against the window. Orâ€”dear Lord in heaven!â€”was it to keep the furniture in?

There was a fairly normal-looking stool; she sank down on this and, closing her eyes, prayed with great fervor. After a bit, she remembered to breathe, and after a further bit, began to be able to think again, shuddering only occasionally.

He hadnâ€™t threatened her. Nor had he hurt her, really, just put a hand over her mouth and his other arm round her body and pulled her along, then boosted her into his coach with a shockingly familiar hand under her bottom, though it hadnâ€™t been done with any sense that he was wanting to interfere with her.

In the coach, heâ€™d introduced himself, apologized briefly for the inconvenienceâ€”inconvenience? The cheek of himâ€”and then had grasped both her hands in his, staring intently into her face as he clasped them tighter and tighter. Heâ€™d raised her hands to his face, so close sheâ€™d thought he meant to smell them or kiss them, but then had let go, his brow deeply furrowed.

Heâ€™d ignored all her questions and her insistence upon being returned to the convent. In fact, he almost seemed to forget she was there, leaving her huddled in the corner of the seat while he thought intently about something, lips pursing in and out. And then he had lugged her up here, told her briefly that she wouldnâ€™t be hurt, added the bit about being a sorcerer in a very offhand sort of a way, and locked her in!

She was terrified, and indignant, too. But now that sheâ€™d calmed down a wee bit, she thought that she wasnâ€™t really afraid of him, and that seemed odd. Surely she should be?

But sheâ€™d believed him when he said he meant her no harm. He hadnâ€™t threatened her or tried to frighten her. But if that was true â€¦ what did he want of her?

He likely wants to know what ye meant by rushing up to him in the market and telling him not to do it, her common senseâ€”lamentably absent to this pointâ€”remarked.

â€œOh,â€ she said aloud. That made some sense. Naturally, heâ€™d be curious about that.

She got up again and explored the room, thinking. She couldnâ€™t tell him any more than she had, though; that was the thing. Would he believe her, about the voices? Even if so, heâ€™d try to find out more, and there wasnâ€™t any more to find out. What then?

Donâ€™t wait about to see, advised her common sense.

Having already come to this conclusion, she didnâ€™t bother replying. Sheâ€™d found a heavy marble mortar and pestle; that might do. Wrapping the mortar in her apron, she went to the window that overlooked the street. Sheâ€™d break the glass, then shriek â€™til she got someoneâ€™s attention. Even so high up, she thought, someone would hear. Pity it was a quiet street. Butâ€”

She stiffened like a bird dog. A coach was stopped outside one of the houses opposite, and Michael Murray was getting out of it! He was just putting on his hatâ€”no mistaking that flaming red hair.

â€œMichael!â€ she shouted at the top of her lungs. But he didnâ€™t look up; the sound wouldnâ€™t pierce glass. She swung the cloth-wrapped mortar at the window, but it bounced off the bars with a ringing clang! She took a deep breath and a better aim; this time, she hit one of the panes and cracked it. Encouraged, she tried again, with all the strength of muscular arms and shoulders, and was rewarded with a small crash, a shower of glass, and a rush of mud-scented air from the river.

â€œMichael!â€ But he had disappeared. A servantâ€™s face showed briefly in the open door of the house opposite, then vanished as the door closed. Through a red haze of frustration, she noticed the swag of black crepe hanging from the knob. Who was dead?

* * *

Charlesâ€™s wife, Eulalie, was in the small parlor, surrounded by a huddle of women. All of them turned to see who had come, many of them lifting their handkerchiefs automatically in preparation for a fresh outbreak of tears. All of them blinked at Michael, then turned to Eulalie, as though for an explanation.

Eulalieâ€™s eyes were red but dry. She looked as though she had been dried in an oven, all the moisture and color sucked out of her, her face paper-white and drawn tight over her bones. She, too, looked at Michael, but without much interest. He thought she was too much shocked for anything to matter much. He knew how she felt.

â€œMonsieur Murray,â€ she said tonelessly, as he bowed over her hand. â€œHow kind of you to call.â€

â€œI â€¦ offer my condolences, madame, mine and my cousinâ€™s. I hadnâ€™t â€¦ heard. Of your grievous loss.â€ He was almost stuttering, trying to grasp the reality of the situation. What the devil had happened to Charles?

Eulalieâ€™s mouth twisted.

â€œGrievous loss,â€ she repeated. â€œYes. Thank you.â€ Then her dull self-absorption cracked a little and she looked at him more sharply. â€œYou hadnâ€™t heard. You meanâ€”you didnâ€™t know? You came to see Charles?â€

â€œEr â€¦ yes, madame,â€ he said awkwardly. A couple of the women gasped, but Eulalie was already on her feet.

â€œWell, you might as well see him, then,â€ she said, and walked out of the room, leaving him with no choice but to follow her.

â€œTheyâ€™ve cleaned him up,â€ she remarked, opening the door to the large parlor across the hall. She might have been talking about a messy domestic incident in the kitchen.

Michael thought it must in fact have been very messy. Charles lay on the large dining table, this adorned with a cloth and wreaths of greenery and flowers. A woman clad in gray was sitting by the table, weaving more wreaths from a basket of leaves and grasses; she glanced up, her eyes going from Eulalie to Michael and back.

â€œLeave,â€ said Eulalie with a flip of the hand, and the woman got up at once and went out. Michael saw that sheâ€™d been making a wreath of laurel leaves and had the sudden absurd thought that she meant to crown Charles with it, in the manner of a Greek hero.

â€œHe cut his throat,â€ Eulalie said. â€œThe coward.â€ She spoke with an eerie calmness, and Michael wondered what might happen when the shock that surrounded her began to dissipate.

He made a respectful sort of noise in his throat and, touching her arm gently, went past her to look down at his friend.

â€œTell him not to do it.â€

The dead man didnâ€™t look peaceful. There were lines of stress in his countenance that hadnâ€™t yet smoothed out, and he appeared to be frowning. The undertakerâ€™s people had cleaned the body and dressed him in a slightly worn suit of dark blue; Michael thought that it was probably the only thing heâ€™d owned that was in any way appropriate in which to appear dead, and suddenly missed his friendâ€™s frivolity with a surge that brought unexpected tears to his eyes.

â€œTell him not to do it.â€ He hadnâ€™t come in time. If Iâ€™d come right away, when she told meâ€”would it have stopped him?

He could smell the blood, a rusty, sickly smell that seeped through the freshness of the flowers and leaves. The undertaker had tied a white neckcloth for Charlesâ€”heâ€™d used an old-fashioned knot, nothing that Charles himself would have worn for a moment. The black stitches showed above it, though, the wound harsh against the dead manâ€™s livid skin.

His own shock was beginning to fray, and stabs of guilt and anger poked through it like needles.

â€œCoward?â€ he said softly. He didnâ€™t mean it as a question, but it seemed more courteous to say it that way. Eulalie snorted, and, looking up, Michael met the full charge of her eyes. No, not shocked any longer.

â€œYouâ€™d know, wouldnâ€™t you,â€ she said, and it wasnâ€™t at all a question, the way she said it. â€œYou knew about your slut of a sister-in-law, didnâ€™t you? And Babette?â€ Her lips curled away from the name. â€œHis other mistress?â€

â€œIâ€”no. I mean â€¦ LÃ©onie told me yesterday. That was why I came to talk to Charles.â€ Well, he would certainly have mentioned LÃ©onie. And he wasnâ€™t going anywhere near the mention of Babette, whom heâ€™d known about for quite some time. But, Jesus, what did the woman think he could have done about it?

â€œCoward,â€ she said, looking down at Charlesâ€™s body with contempt. â€œHe made a mess of everythingâ€”everything!â€”and then couldnâ€™t deal with it, so he runs off and leaves me alone, with children, penniless!â€

â€œTell him not to do it.â€

Michael looked to see if this was an exaggeration, but it wasnâ€™t. She was burning now, but with fear as much as anger, her frozen calm quite vanished.

â€œThe â€¦ house â€¦?â€ he began, with a rather vague wave around the expensive, stylish room. He knew it was her family house; sheâ€™d brought it to the marriage.

She snorted.

â€œHe lost it in a card game last week,â€ she said bitterly. â€œIf Iâ€™m lucky, the new owner will let me bury him before we have to leave.â€

â€œAh.â€ The mention of card games jolted him back to an awareness of his reason for coming here. â€œI wonder, madame, do you know an acquaintance of Charlesâ€™sâ€”the Comte St. Germain?â€ It was crude, but he hadnâ€™t time to think of a graceful way to come to it.

Eugenia blinked, nonplussed.

â€œThe comte? Why do you want to know about him?â€ Her expression sharpened into eagerness. â€œDo you think he owes Charles money?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know, but Iâ€™ll certainly find out for you,â€ Michael promised her. â€œIf you can tell me where to find Monsieur le Comte.â€

She didnâ€™t laugh, but her mouth quirked in what might in another mood have been humor.

â€œHe lives across the street.â€ She pointed toward the window. â€œIn that big pile ofâ€”where are you going?â€

But Michael was already through the door and into the hallway, bootheels clattering on the parquet in his haste.

* * *

There were footsteps coming up the stairs; Joan started away from the window but then craned back, desperately willing the door across the street to open and let Michael out. What was he doing there?

That door didnâ€™t open, but a key rattled in the lock of the door to the room. In desperation, she tore the rosary from her belt and pushed it through the hole in the window, then dashed across the room and threw herself into one of the repulsive chairs.

It was the comte. He glanced round, worried for an instant, and then his face relaxed when he saw her. He came toward her, holding out his hand.

â€œIâ€™m sorry to have kept you waiting, mademoiselle,â€ he said, very courtly. â€œCome, please. I have something to show you.â€

â€œI donâ€™t want to see it.â€ She stiffened a little and tucked her feet under her, to make it harder for him to pick her up. If she could just delay him until Michael came out! But he might well not see her rosary or, even if he did, know it was hers. Why should he? All nunsâ€™ rosaries looked the same!

She strained her ears, hoping to hear the sounds of departure on the other side of the streetâ€”sheâ€™d scream her lungs out. In fact â€¦

The comte sighed a little but bent and took her by the elbows, lifting her straight up, her knees still absurdly bent. He was really very strong. She put her feet down, and there she was, her hand tucked into the crook of his elbow, being led across the room toward the door, docile as a cow on its way to be milked! She made her mind up in an instant, yanked free, and ran to the smashed window.

â€œHELP!â€ she bellowed through the broken pane. â€œHelp me, help me! Au secours, I mean! AU SECOUâ€”â€ The comteâ€™s hand clapped across her mouth, and he said something in French that she was sure must be bad language. He scooped her up, so fast that the wind was knocked out of her, and had her through the door before she could make another sound.

* * *

Michael didnâ€™t pause for hat or cloak but burst into the street, so fast that his driver started out of a doze and the horses jerked and neighed in protest. He didnâ€™t pause for that, either, but shot across the cobbles and pounded on the door, a big bronze-coated affair that boomed under his fists.

It couldnâ€™t have been very long but seemed an eternity. He fumed, pounded again, and, pausing for breath, caught sight of the rosary on the pavement. He ran to catch it up, scratched his hand, and saw that it lay in a scatter of glass fragments. At once he looked up, searching, and saw the broken window just as the big door opened.

He sprang at the butler like a wildcat, seizing him by the arms.

â€œWhere is she? Where, damn you?â€

â€œShe? But there is no â€˜she,â€™ monsieur.â€¦ Monsieur le Comte lives quite alone. Youâ€”â€

â€œWhere is Monsieur le Comte?â€ Michaelâ€™s sense of urgency was so great, he felt that he might strike the man. The man apparently felt he might, too, because he turned pale and, wrenching himself loose, fled into the depths of the house. With no more than an instantâ€™s hesitation, Michael pursued him.

The butler, his feet fueled by fear, flew down the hall, Michael in grim pursuit. The man burst through the door to the kitchen; Michael was dimly aware of the shocked faces of cooks and maids, and then they were out into the kitchen garden. The butler slowed for an instant going down the steps, and Michael launched himself at the man, knocking him flat.

They rolled together on the graveled path, then Michael got on top of the smaller man, seized him by the shirtfront, and, shaking him, shouted, â€œWHERE IS HE?â€

Thoroughly undone, the butler covered his face with one arm and pointed blindly toward a gate in the wall.

Michael leapt off the supine body and ran. He could hear the rumble of coach wheels, the rattle of hoovesâ€”he flung open the gate in time to see the back of a coach rattling down the allÃ©e and a gaping servant paused in the act of sliding to the doors of a carriage house. He ran, but it was clear that heâ€™d never catch the coach on foot.

â€œJOAN!â€ he bellowed after the vanishing equipage. â€œIâ€™m coming!â€

He didnâ€™t waste time in questioning the servant but ran back, pushing his way through the maids and footmen gathered round the cowering butler, and burst out of the house, startling his own coachman afresh.

â€œThat way!â€ he shouted, pointing toward the distant conjunction of the street and the allÃ©e, where the comteâ€™s coach was just emerging. â€œFollow that coach! Vite!â€

* * *

â€œVite!â€ The comte urged his coachman on, then sank back, letting fall the hatch in the roof. The light was fading; his errand had taken longer than heâ€™d expected, and he wanted to be out of the city before night fell. The city streets were dangerous at night.

His captive was staring at him, her eyes enormous in the dim light. Sheâ€™d lost her postulantâ€™s veil, and her dark hair was loose on her shoulders. She looked charming but very scared. He reached into the bag on the floor and pulled out a flask of brandy.

â€œHave a little of this, chÃ©rie.â€ He removed the cork and handed it to her. She took it but looked uncertain what to do with it, nose wrinkling at the hot smell.

â€œReally,â€ he assured her. â€œIt will make you feel better.â€

â€œThatâ€™s what they all say,â€ she said in her slow, awkward French.

â€œAll of whom?â€ he asked, startled.

â€œThe Auld Ones. I donâ€™t know what you call them in French, exactly. The folk that live in the hillsâ€”souterrain?â€ she added doubtfully. â€œUnderground?â€

â€œUnderground? And they give you brandy?â€ He smiled at her, but his heart gave a sudden thump of excitement. Perhaps she was. Heâ€™d doubted his instincts when his touch failed to kindle her, but clearly she was something.

â€œThey give you food and drink,â€ she said, putting the flask down between the squab and the wall. â€œBut if you take any, you lose time.â€

The spurt of excitement came again, stronger.

â€œLose time?â€ he repeated, encouraging. â€œHow do you mean?â€

She struggled to find words, smooth brow furrowed with the effort.

â€œThey â€¦ you â€¦ one who is enchanted by themâ€”he, it? No, heâ€”goes into the hill, and thereâ€™s music and feasting and dancing. But in the morning, when he goes â€¦ back, itâ€™s two hundred years later than it was when he went to feast with the â€¦ the Folk. Everybody he knew has turned to dust.â€

â€œHow interesting!â€ he said. It was. He also wondered, with a fresh spasm of excitement, whether the old paintings, the ones far back in the bowels of the chalk mine, might have been made by these Folk, whoever they were.

She observed him narrowly, apparently for an indication that he was a faerie. He smiled at her, though his heart was now thumping audibly in his ears. Two hundred years! For that was what MÃ©lisandeâ€”Damn her, he thought briefly, with a pang at the reminder of Madeleineâ€”had told him was the usual period when one traveled through stone. It could be changed by use of gemstones or blood, she said, but that was the usual. And it had been, the first time he went back.

â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ he said to the girl, hoping to reassure her. â€œI only want you to look at something. Then Iâ€™ll take you back to the conventâ€”assuming that you still want to go there?â€ He lifted an eyebrow, half-teasing. It really wasnâ€™t his intent to frighten her, though he already had, and he feared that more fright was unavoidable. He wondered just what she might do when she realized that he was in fact planning to take her underground.

* * *

Michael knelt on the seat, his head out the window of the coach, urging it on by force of will and muscle. It was nearly full dark, and the comteâ€™s coach was visible only as a distantly moving blot. They were out of the city, though; there were no other large vehicles on the road, nor likely to beâ€”and there were very few turnings where such a large equipage might leave the main road.

The wind blew in his face, tugging strands of hair loose so they beat about his face. It blew the faint scent of decay, tooâ€”theyâ€™d pass the cemetery in a few minutes.

He wished passionately that heâ€™d thought to bring a pistol, a smallswordâ€”anything! But there was nothing in the coach with him, and he had nothing on his person save his clothes and what was in his pockets: this consisting, after a hasty inventory, of a handful of coins, a used handkerchiefâ€”the one Joan had given back to him, in fact, and he crumpled it tightly in one handâ€”a tinderbox, a mangled paper spill, a stub of sealing wax, and a small stone heâ€™d picked up in the street, pinkish with a yellow stripe. Perhaps he could improvise a sling with the handkerchief, he thought wildly, and paste the comte in the forehead with the stone, Ã  la David and Goliath. And then cut off the comteâ€™s head with the penknife he discovered in his breast pocket, he supposed.

Joanâ€™s rosary was also in that pocket; he took it out and wound it round his left hand, holding the beads for comfortâ€”he was too distracted to pray, beyond the words he repeated silently over and over, hardly noticing what he said.

Let me find her in time!

* * *

â€œTell me,â€ the comte asked curiously, â€œwhy did you speak to me in the market that day?â€

â€œI wish I hadnâ€™t,â€ Joan replied briefly. She didnâ€™t trust him an inchâ€”still less since heâ€™d offered her the brandy. It hadnâ€™t struck her before that that he really might be one of the Auld Ones. They could walk about, looking just like people. Her own mother had been convinced for yearsâ€”and even some of the Murrays thought soâ€”that Daâ€™s wife, Claire, was one. She herself wasnâ€™t sure; Claire had been kind to her, but no one said the Folk couldnâ€™t be kind if they wanted to.

Daâ€™s wife. A sudden thought paralyzed her: the memory of her first meeting with Mother Hildegarde, when sheâ€™d given the Reverend Mother Claireâ€™s letter. Sheâ€™d said, â€œma mÃ¨re,â€ unable to think of a word that might mean â€œstepmother.â€ It hadnâ€™t seemed to matter; why should anyone care?

â€œClaire Fraser,â€ she said aloud, watching the comte carefully. â€œDo you know her?â€

His eyes widened, showing white in the gloaming. Oh, aye, he kent her, all right!

â€œI do,â€ he said, leaning forward. â€œYour mother, is she not?â€

â€œNo!â€ Joan said, with great force, and repeated it in French, several times for emphasis. â€œNo, sheâ€™s not!â€

But she observed, with a sinking heart, that her force had been misplaced. He didnâ€™t believe her; she could tell by the eagerness in his face. He thought she was lying to put him off.

â€œI told you what I did in the market because the voices told me to!â€ she blurted, desperate for anything that might distract him from the horrifying notion that she was one of the Folk. Though if he was one, her common sense pointed out, he ought to be able to recognize her. Oh, Jesus, Lamb of Godâ€”thatâ€™s what heâ€™d been trying to do, holding her hands so tight and staring into her face.

â€œVoices?â€ he said, looking rather blank. â€œWhat voices?â€

â€œThe ones in my head,â€ she said, heaving an internal sigh of exasperation. â€œThey tell me things now and then. About other people, I mean. You know,â€ she went on, encouraging him, â€œIâ€™m aâ€”aâ€â€”St. Jerome on a bannock, what was the word?!?â€”â€œsomeone who sees the future,â€ she ended weakly. â€œEr â€¦ some of it. Sometimes. Not always.â€

The comte was rubbing a finger over his upper lip; she didnâ€™t know if he was expressing doubt or trying not to laugh, but either way it made her angry.

â€œSo one of them told me to tell ye that, and I did!â€ she said, lapsing into Scots. â€œI dinna ken what it is yeâ€™re no supposed to do, but Iâ€™d advise ye not to do it!â€

It occurred to her belatedly that perhaps killing her was the thing he wasnâ€™t supposed to do, and she was about to put this notion to him, but by the time she had disentangled enough grammar to have a go at it, the coach was slowing, bumping from side to side as it turned off the main road. A sickly smell seeped into the air, and she sat up straight, her heart in her throat.

â€œMary, Joseph, and Bride,â€ she said, her voice no more than a squeak. â€œWhere are we?â€

* * *

Michael leapt from the coach almost before it had stopped moving. He darenâ€™t let them get too far ahead of him; his driver had nearly missed the turning, as it was, and the comteâ€™s coach had come to a halt minutes before his own reached it.

â€œTalk to the other driver,â€ he shouted at his own, half visible on the box. â€œFind out why the comte has come here! Find out what heâ€™s doing!â€

Nothing good. He was sure of that. Though he couldnâ€™t imagine why anyone would kidnap a nun and drag her out of Paris in the dark, only to stop at the edge of a public cemetery. Unless â€¦ half-heard rumors of depraved men who murdered and dismembered their victims, even those who ate â€¦ His wame rose and he nearly vomited, but it wasnâ€™t possible to vomit and run at the same time, and he could see a pale splotch on the darkness that he thoughtâ€”he hoped, he fearedâ€”must be Joan.

Suddenly the night burst into flower. A huge puff of green fire bloomed in the darkness, and by its eerie glow he saw her clearly, her hair flying in the wind.

He opened his mouth to shout, to call out to her, but he had no breath, and before he could recover it she vanished into the ground, the comte following her, torch in hand.

He reached the shaft moments later, and he saw below the faintest green glow, just vanishing down a tunnel. Without an instantâ€™s hesitation, he flung himself down the ladder.

* * *

â€œDo you hear anything?â€ the comte kept asking her as they stumbled along the white-walled tunnels, he grasping her so hard by the arm that heâ€™d surely leave bruises on her skin.

â€œNo,â€ she gasped. â€œWhat â€¦ am I listening for?â€

He merely shook his head in a displeased way, but more as though he was listening for something himself than because he was angry with her for not hearing it.

She had some hopes that heâ€™d meant what he said and would take her back. He did mean to go back himself; heâ€™d lit several torches and left them burning along their way. So he wasnâ€™t about to disappear into the hill altogether, taking her with him to the lighted ballroom where people danced all night with the Fine Folk, unaware that their own world slipped past beyond the stones of the hill.

The comte stopped abruptly, hand squeezing harder round her arm.

â€œBe still,â€ he said very quietly, though she wasnâ€™t making any noise. â€œListen.â€

She listened as hard as possibleâ€”and thought she did hear something. What she thought she heard, though, was footsteps, far in the distance. Behind them. Her heart seized up for a moment.

â€œWhatâ€”what do you hear?â€ she thought of asking. He glanced down at her, but not as though he really saw her.

â€œThem,â€ he said. â€œThe stones. They make a buzzing sound, most of the time. If itâ€™s close to a fire feast or a sun feast, though, they begin to sing.â€

â€œDo they?â€ she said faintly. He was hearing something, and evidently it wasnâ€™t the footsteps sheâ€™d heard. The footsteps had stopped now, as though whoever followed was waiting, maybe stealing along, one step at a time, careful to make no sound.

â€œYes,â€ he said, and his face was intent. He looked at her sharply again, and this time he saw her.

â€œYou donâ€™t hear them,â€ he said with certainty, and she shook her head. He pressed his lips tight together but after a moment lifted his chin, gesturing toward another tunnel, where there seemed to be something painted on the chalk.

He paused there to light another torchâ€”this one burned a brilliant yellow and stank of sulfurâ€”and she saw by its light the wavering shape of the Virgin and Child. Her heart lifted at the sight, for surely faeries would have no such thing in their lair.

â€œCome,â€ he said, and now took her by the hand. His own was cold.

* * *

Michael caught a glimpse of them as they moved into a side tunnel. The comte had lit another torch, a red one this timeâ€”how did he do that?â€”and it was easy to follow its glow.

How far down in the bowels of the earth were they? He had long since lost track of the turnings, though he might be able to get back by following the torchesâ€”assuming they hadnâ€™t all burned out.

He still had no plan in mind, other than to follow them until they stopped. Then heâ€™d make himself known and â€¦ well, take Joan away, by whatever means proved necessary.

Swallowing hard, rosary still wrapped around his left hand and penknife in his right, he stepped into the shadows.

* * *

The chamber was round and quite large. Big enough that the torchlight didnâ€™t reach all the edges, but it lit the pentagram inscribed into the floor in the center.

The noise was making Rakoczyâ€™s bones ache, and often as he had heard it, it never failed to make his heart race and his hands sweat. He let go of the nunâ€™s hand for a moment to wipe his palm on the skirts of his coat, not wanting to disgust her. She looked scared but not terrified, and if she heard it, surely sheâ€”

Her eyes had widened suddenly.

â€œWhoâ€™s that?â€ she said.

He whirled, to see Raymond standing tranquilly in the center of the pentagram.

â€œBon soir, mademoiselle,â€ the frog said, bowing politely.

â€œAh â€¦ bon soir,â€ the girl replied faintly.

â€œWhat the devil are you doing here?â€ Rakoczy interposed his body between Raymond and the nun.

â€œVery likely the same thing you are,â€ the frog replied. â€œMight you introduce your petite amie, sir?â€

Shock, anger, and sheer confusion robbed Rakoczy of speech for a moment. What was the infernal creature doing here? Waitâ€”the girl! The lost daughter heâ€™d mentioned: the nun was the daughter! Heâ€™d discovered her whereabouts and somehow followed them to this place. Rakoczy took hold of the girlâ€™s arm again, firmly.

â€œShe is a Scotch,â€ he said. â€œAnd, as you see, a nun. No concern of yours.â€

The frog looked amused, cool and unruffled. Rakoczy was sweating, the noise beating against his skin in waves. He could feel the little bag of stones in his pocket, a hard lump against his heart. They seemed to be warm, warmer even than his skin.

â€œI doubt that she is, really,â€ said Raymond. â€œWhy is she a concern of yours, though?â€

â€œThatâ€™s also none of your business.â€ He was trying to think. He couldnâ€™t lay out the stones, not with the damned frog standing there. Could he just leave with the girl? But if the frog meant him harm â€¦ and if the girl truly wasnâ€™t â€¦

Raymond ignored the incivility and bowed again to the girl.

â€œI am Master Raymond, my dear,â€ he said. â€œAnd you?â€

â€œJoan Macâ€”â€ she said. â€œEr â€¦ Sister Gregory, I mean.â€ She tried to pull away from Rakoczyâ€™s grip. â€œUm. If Iâ€™m not the concern of either of you gentlemenâ€”â€

â€œSheâ€™s my concern, gentlemen.â€ The voice was high with nerves, but firm. Rakoczy looked round, shocked to see the young wine merchant walk into the chamber, disheveled and dirty but eyes fixed on the girl. At Rakoczyâ€™s side, the nun gasped.

â€œSister.â€ The merchant bowed. He was white-faced but not sweating. He looked as though the chill of the cavern had seeped into his bones, but he put out a hand, from which the beads of a wooden rosary swung. â€œYou dropped your rosary.â€

* * *

Joan thought she might faint from sheer relief. Her knees wobbled from terror and exhaustion, but she summoned enough strength to wrench free of the comte and run, stumbling, into Michaelâ€™s arms. He grabbed her and hauled her away from the comte, half-dragging her.

The comte made an angry sound and took a step in Joanâ€™s direction, but Michael said, â€œStop right there, ye wicked bugger!â€ just as the little froggy-faced man said sharply, â€œStop!â€

The comte swung toward first one and then the other. He looked â€¦ crazed. Joan swallowed and nudged Michael, urging him toward the chamberâ€™s door, only then noticing the penknife in his hand.

â€œWhat were ye going to do wiâ€™ that?â€ she whispered. â€œShave him?â€

â€œLet the air out of him,â€ Michael muttered. He lowered his hand but didnâ€™t put the knife away and kept his eyes on the two men.

â€œYour daughter,â€ the comte said hoarsely to the man who called himself Master Raymond. â€œYou were looking for a lost daughter. Iâ€™ve found her for you.â€

Raymondâ€™s brows shot up, and he glanced at Joan.

â€œMine?â€ he said, astonished. â€œShe isnâ€™t one of mine. Canâ€™t you tell?â€

The comte drew a breath so deep it cracked in his throat.

â€œTell? Butâ€”â€

The frog looked impatient.

â€œCan you not see auras? The electrical fluid that surrounds people,â€ he elucidated, waving a hand around his own head.

The comte rubbed a hand hard over his face. â€œI canâ€™tâ€”â€

â€œFor goodness sake, come in here!â€ Raymond stepped to the edge of the star, reached across, and seized the comteâ€™s hand.

* * *

Rakoczy stiffened at the touch. Blue light exploded from their linked hands, and he gasped, feeling a surge of energy such as he had never before experienced. Raymond pulled hard, and Rakoczy stepped across the line into the pentagram.

Silence. The buzzing had stopped. He nearly wept with the relief of it.

â€œIâ€”youâ€”â€ he stammered, looking at the linked hands.

â€œYou didnâ€™t know?â€ Raymond looked surprised.

â€œThat you were aâ€”â€ He waved at the pentagram. â€œI thought you might be.â€

â€œNot that,â€ Raymond said, almost gently. â€œThat you were one of mine.â€

â€œYours?â€ Rakoczy looked down again; the blue light was pulsing gently now, surrounding their fingers.

â€œEveryone has an aura of some kind,â€ Raymond said. â€œBut only my â€¦ people â€¦ have this.â€

In the blessed silence, it was possible to think again. And the first thing that came to mind was the Star Chamber, the king looking on as they had faced each other over a poisoned cup. And now he knew why the frog hadnâ€™t killed him.

* * *

His mind bubbled with questions. La Dame Blanche, blue light, MÃ©lisande, and Madeleine â€¦ Thought of Madeleine and what grew in her womb nearly stopped him, but the urge to find out, to know at last, was too strong.

â€œCan youâ€”can weâ€”go forward?â€

Raymond hesitated a moment, then nodded.

â€œYes. But itâ€™s not safe. Not safe at all.â€

â€œWill you show me?â€

â€œI mean it.â€ The frogâ€™s grip tightened on his. â€œItâ€™s not a safe thing to know, let alone to do.â€

Rakoczy laughed, feeling all at once exhilarated, full of joy. Why should he fear knowledge? Perhaps the passage would kill himâ€”but he had a pocket full of gems, and, besides, what was the point of waiting to die slowly?

â€œTell me!â€ he said, squeezing the otherâ€™s hand. â€œFor the sake of our shared blood!â€

* * *

Joan stood stock-still, amazed. Michaelâ€™s arm was still around her, but she scarcely noticed.

â€œHe is!â€ she whispered. â€œHe truly is! They both are!â€

â€œAre what?â€ Michael gaped at her.

â€œAuld Folk! Faeries!â€

He looked wildly back at the scene before them. The two men stood face-to-face, hands locked together, their mouths moving in animated conversationâ€”in total silence. It was like watching mimes but even less interesting.

â€œI dinna care what they are. Loons, criminals, demons, angels â€¦ Come on!â€ He dropped his arm and seized her hand, but she was planted solid as an oak sapling, her eyes growing wide and wider.

She gripped his hand hard enough to grind the bones and shrieked at the top of her lungs, â€œDonâ€™t do it!!â€

He whirled round just in time to see them vanish.

* * *

They stumbled together down the long, pale passages, bathed in the flickering light of dying torches, red, yellow, blue, green, a ghastly purple that made Joanâ€™s face look drowned.

â€œDes feux dâ€™artifice,â€ Michael said. His voice sounded queer, echoing in the empty tunnels. â€œA conjurerâ€™s trick.â€

â€œWhat?â€ Joan looked drugged, her eyes black with shock.

â€œThe fires. The â€¦ colors. Have ye never heard of fireworks?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œOh.â€ It seemed too much a struggle to explain, and they went on in silence, hurrying as much as they could, to reach the shaft before the light died entirely.

At the bottom, he paused to let her go first, thinking too late that he should have gone firstâ€”sheâ€™d think he meant to look up her dress.â€¦ He turned hastily away, face burning.

â€œDâ€™ye think he was? That they were?â€ She was hanging on to the ladder, a few feet above him. Beyond her, he could see the stars, serene in a velvet sky.

â€œWere what?â€ He looked at her face, so as not to risk her modesty. She was looking better now but very serious.

â€œWere they Auld Folk? Faeries?â€

â€œI suppose they must haâ€™ been.â€ His mind was moving very slowly; he didnâ€™t want to have to try to think. He motioned to her to climb and followed her up, his eyes tightly shut. If they were Auld Ones, then likely so was Auntie Claire. He truly didnâ€™t want to think about that.

He drew the fresh air gratefully into his lungs. The wind was toward the city now, coming off the fields, full of the resinous cool scent of pine trees and the breath of grass and cattle. He felt Joan breathe it in, sigh deeply, and then she turned to him, put her arms around him, and rested her forehead on his chest. He put his arms round her and they stood for some time, in peace.

Finally, she stirred and straightened up.

â€œYeâ€™d best take me back, then,â€ she said. â€œThe sisters will be half out oâ€™ their minds.â€

He was conscious of a sharp sense of disappointment but turned obediently toward the coach, standing in the distance. Then he turned back.

â€œYeâ€™re sure?â€ he said. â€œDid your voices tell ye to go back?â€

She made a sound that wasnâ€™t quite a rueful laugh.

â€œI dinna need a voice to tell me that.â€ She brushed a hand through her hair, smoothing it off her face. â€œIn the Highlands, if a manâ€™s widowed, he takes another wife as soon as he can get one; heâ€™s got to have someone to mend his shirt and rear his bairns. But Sister PhilomÃ¨ne says itâ€™s different in Paris; that a man might mourn for a year.â€

â€œHe might,â€ he said, after a short silence. Would a year be enough, he wondered, to heal the great hole where Lillie had been? He knew he would never forgetâ€”never stop looking for herâ€”but he didnâ€™t forget what Ian had told him, either.

â€œBut after a time, ye find yeâ€™re in a different place than ye were. A different person than ye were. And then ye look about and see whatâ€™s there with ye. Yeâ€™ll maybe find a use for yourself.â€

Joanâ€™s face was pale and serious in the moonlight, her mouth gentle.

â€œItâ€™s a year before a postulant makes up her mind. Whether to stay and become a noviceâ€”or â€¦ or leave. It takes time. To know.â€

â€œAye,â€ he said softly. â€œAye, it does.â€

He turned to go, but she stopped him, a hand on his arm.

â€œMichael,â€ she said. â€œKiss me, aye? I think I should maybe know that, before I decide.â€

CHAPTER THREE:

IN WHICH THE WOMEN, AS USUAL, PICK UP THE PIECES

No. 17 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia The residence of Lord and Lady John Grey

William had left the house like a thunderclap, and the place looked as though it had been struck by lightning. I certainly felt like the survivor of a massive electrical storm, hairs and nerve endings all standing up straight on end, waving in agitation.

Jenny Murray had entered the house on the heels of Williamâ€™s departure, and while the sight of her was a lesser shock than any of the others so far, it still left me speechless. I goggled at my erstwhile sister-in-lawâ€”though, come to think, she still was my sister-in-law â€¦ because Jamie was alive. Alive.

Heâ€™d been in my arms not ten minutes before, and the memory of his touch flickered through me like lightning in a bottle. I was dimly aware that I was smiling like a loon, despite massive destruction, horrific scenes, Williamâ€™s distressâ€”if you could call an explosion like that â€œdistressâ€â€”Jamieâ€™s danger, and a faint wonder as to what either Jenny or Mrs. Figg, Lord Johnâ€™s cook and housekeeper, might be about to say.

Mrs. Figg was smoothly spherical, gleamingly black, and inclined to glide silently up behind one like a menacing ball bearing.

â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€ she barked, manifesting herself suddenly behind Jenny.

â€œHoly Mother of God!â€ Jenny whirled, eyes round and hand pressed to her chest. â€œWho in Godâ€™s name are you?â€

â€œThis is Mrs. Figg,â€ I said, feeling a surreal urge to laugh, despiteâ€”or maybe because ofâ€”recent events. â€œLord John Greyâ€™s cook. And Mrs. Figg, this is Mrs. Murray. My, um â€¦ my â€¦â€

â€œYour good-sister,â€ Jenny said firmly. She raised one black eyebrow. â€œIf yeâ€™ll have me still?â€ Her look was straight and open, and the urge to laugh changed abruptly into an equally strong urge to burst into tears. Of all the unlikely sources of succor I could have imagined â€¦ I took a deep breath and put out my hand.

â€œIâ€™ll have you.â€ We hadnâ€™t parted on good terms in Scotland, but I had loved her very much, once, and wasnâ€™t about to pass up any opportunity to mend things.

Her small firm fingers wove through mine, squeezed hard, and, as simply as that, it was done. No need for apologies or spoken forgiveness. Sheâ€™d never had to wear the mask that Jamie did. What she thought and felt was there in her eyes, those slanted blue cat-eyes she shared with her brother. She knew the truth now of what I was, and she knew I loved and always had loved her brother with all my heart and soulâ€”despite the minor complications of my being presently married to someone else.

She heaved a sigh, eyes closing for an instant, then opened them and smiled at me, mouth trembling only a little.

â€œWell, fine and dandy,â€ said Mrs. Figg shortly. She narrowed her eyes and rotated smoothly on her axis, taking in the panorama of destruction. The railing at the top of the stair had been ripped off, and cracked banisters, dented walls, and bloody smudges marked the path of Williamâ€™s descent. Shattered crystals from the chandelier littered the floor, glinting festively in the light from the open front door, the door itself cracked through and hanging drunkenly from one hinge.

â€œMerde on toast,â€ Mrs. Figg murmured. She turned abruptly to me, her small black-currant eyes still narrowed. â€œWhereâ€™s his lordship?â€

â€œAh,â€ I said. This was going to be rather sticky, I saw. While deeply disapproving of most people, Mrs. Figg was devoted to John. She wasnâ€™t going to be at all pleased to hear that heâ€™d been abducted byâ€”

â€œFor that matter, whereâ€™s my brother?â€ Jenny inquired, glancing round as though expecting Jamie to appear suddenly out from under the settee.

â€œOh,â€ I said. â€œHmm. Well â€¦â€ Possibly worse than sticky. Because â€¦

â€œAnd whereâ€™s my sweet William?â€ Mrs. Figg demanded, sniffing the air. â€œHeâ€™s been here; I smell that stinky cologne he puts on his linen.â€ She nudged a dislodged chunk of plaster disapprovingly with the toe of her shoe.

I took another long, deep breath and a tight grip on what remained of my sanity.

â€œMrs. Figg,â€ I said, â€œperhaps you would be so kind as to make us all a cup of tea?â€

We sat in the parlor, while Mrs. Figg came and went to the cookhouse, keeping an eye on her terrapin stew.

â€œYou donâ€™t want to scorch turtle, no, you donâ€™t,â€ she said severely to us, setting down the teapot in its padded yellow cozy on her return. â€œNot with so much sherry as his lordship likes in it. Almost a full bottleâ€”terrible waste of good liquor, that would be.â€

My insides turned over promptly. Turtle soupâ€”with a lot of sherryâ€”had certain strong and private associations for me, these being connected with Jamie, feverish delirium, and the way in which a heaving ship assists sexual intercourse. Contemplation of which would not assist the impending discussion in the slightest. I rubbed a finger between my brows, in hopes of dispelling the buzzing cloud of confusion gathering there. The air in the house still felt electric.

â€œSpeaking of sherry,â€ I said, â€œor any other sort of strong spirits you might have convenient, Mrs. Figg â€¦â€

She looked thoughtfully at me, nodded, and reached for the decanter on the sideboard.

â€œBrandy is stronger,â€ she said, and set it in front of me.

Jenny looked at me with the same thoughtfulness and, reaching out, poured a good-sized slug of the brandy into my cup, then a similar one into her own.

â€œJust in case,â€ she said, raising one brow, and we drank for a few moments. I thought it might take something stronger than brandy-laced tea to deal with the effect of recent events on my nervesâ€”laudanum, say, or a large slug of straight Scotch whiskyâ€”but the tea undeniably helped, hot and aromatic, settling in a soft trickling warmth amidships.

â€œSo, then. Weâ€™re fettled, are we?â€ Jenny set down her own cup and looked expectant.

â€œItâ€™s a start.â€ I took a deep breath and gave her a prÃ©cis of recent events.

Jennyâ€™s eyes were disturbingly like Jamieâ€™s. She blinked at me once, then twice, and shook her head as though to clear it, accepting what Iâ€™d just told her.

â€œSo Jamieâ€™s gone off wiâ€™ your Lord John, the British army is after them, the tall lad I met on the stoop wiâ€™ steam cominâ€™ out of his ears is Jamieâ€™s sonâ€”well, of course he is; a blind man could see thatâ€”and the townâ€™s aboil wiâ€™ British soldiers. Is that it, then?â€

â€œHeâ€™s not exactly my Lord John,â€ I said. â€œBut, yes, thatâ€™s essentially the position. I take it Jamie told you about William?â€

â€œAye, he did.â€ She grinned at me over the rim of her teacup. â€œIâ€™m that happy for him. But whatâ€™s troubling his lad, then? He looked like he wouldna give the road to a bear.â€

â€œWhat did you say?â€ Mrs. Figgâ€™s voice cut in abruptly. She set down the tray she had just brought in, the silver milk jug and sugar basin rattling like castanets. â€œWilliam is whose son?â€

I took a fortifying gulp of tea. Mrs. Figg did know that Iâ€™d been married toâ€”and theoretically widowed fromâ€”one James Fraser. But that was all she knew.

â€œWell,â€ I said, and paused to clear my throat. â€œThe, um, tall gentleman with the red hair who was just hereâ€”you saw him?â€

â€œI did.â€ Mrs. Figg eyed me narrowly.

â€œDid you get a good look at him?â€

â€œDidnâ€™t pay much heed to his face when he came to the door and asked where you were, but I saw his backside pretty plain when he pushed past me and ran up the stairs.â€

â€œPossibly the resemblance is less marked from that angle.â€ I took another mouthful of tea. â€œUm â€¦ that gentleman is James Fraser, my â€¦ er â€¦ myâ€”â€ â€œFirst husbandâ€ wasnâ€™t accurate, and neither was â€œlast husbandâ€â€”or even, unfortunately, â€œmost recent husband.â€ I settled for the simplest alternative. â€œMy husband. And, er â€¦ Williamâ€™s father.â€

Mrs. Figgâ€™s mouth opened, soundless for an instant. She backed up slowly and sat down on a needlework ottoman with a soft phumph.

â€œWilliam know that?â€ she asked, after a momentâ€™s contemplation.

â€œHe does now,â€ I said, with a brief gesture toward the devastation in the stairwell, clearly visible through the door of the parlor where we were sitting.

â€œMerde onâ€”I mean, Holy Lamb of God preserve us.â€ Mrs. Figgâ€™s second husband was a Methodist preacher, and she strove to be a credit to him, but her first had been a French gambler. Her eyes fixed on me like gun-sights.

â€œYou his mother?â€

I choked on my tea.

â€œNo,â€ I said, wiping my chin with a linen napkin. â€œIt isnâ€™t quite that complicated.â€ In fact, it was more so, but I wasnâ€™t going to explain just how Willie had come about, either to Mrs. Figg or to Jenny. Jamie had to have told Jenny who Williamâ€™s mother was, but I doubted that heâ€™d told his sister that Williamâ€™s mother, Geneva Dunsany, had forced him into her bed by threatening Jennyâ€™s family. No man of spirit likes to admit that heâ€™s been effectively blackmailed by an eighteen-year-old girl.

â€œLord John became Williamâ€™s legal guardian when Williamâ€™s grandfather died, and at that point, Lord John also married Lady Isobel Dunsany, Willieâ€™s motherâ€™s sister. Sheâ€™d looked after Willie since his motherâ€™s death in childbirth, and she and Lord John were essentially Willieâ€™s parents since he was quite young. Isobel died when he was eleven or so.â€

Mrs. Figg took this explanation in stride, but wasnâ€™t about to be distracted from the main point at issue.

â€œJames Fraser,â€ she said, tapping a couple of broad fingers on her knee and looking accusingly at Jenny. â€œHow comes he not to be dead? News was he drowned.â€ She cut her eyes at me. â€œI thought his lordship was like to throw himself in the harbor, too, when he heard it.â€

I closed my own eyes with a sudden shudder, the salt-cold horror of that news washing over me in a wave of memory. Even with Jamieâ€™s touch still joyful on my skin and the knowledge of him glowing in my heart, I relived the crushing pain of hearing that he was dead.

â€œWell, I can enlighten ye on that point, at least.â€

I opened my eyes to see Jenny drop a lump of sugar into her fresh tea and nod at Mrs. Figg. â€œWe were to take passage on a ship called Euterpeâ€”my brother and myselfâ€”out oâ€™ Brest. But the blackhearted thief of a captain sailed without us. Much good it did him,â€ she added, frowning.

Much good, indeed. The Euterpe had sunk in a storm in the Atlantic, lost with all hands. As Iâ€”and John Greyâ€”had been told.

â€œJamie found us another ship, but it landed us in Virginia, and weâ€™d to make our way up the coast, partly by wagon, partly by packet boat, keepinâ€™ out of the way of the soldiers. Those wee needles ye gave Jamie against the seasickness work most oâ€™ the time,â€ she added, turning approvingly to me. â€œHe showed me how to put them in for him. But when we came to Philadelphia yesterday,â€ she went on, returning to her tale, â€œwe stole into the city by night, like a pair oâ€™ thieves, and made our way to Fergusâ€™s printshop. Lord, I thought my heart would stop a dozen times!â€

She smiled at the memory, and I was struck by the change in her. The shadow of sorrow still lay on her face, and she was thin and worn by travel, but the terrible strain of her husband Ianâ€™s long dying had lifted. There was color in her cheeks again, and a brightness in her eyes that I had not seen since I had first known her thirty years before. She had found her peace, I thought, and felt a thankfulness that eased my own soul.

â€œâ€¦ so Jamie taps on the door at the back, and thereâ€™s no answer, though we can see the light of a fire cominâ€™ through the shutters. He knocks again, makinâ€™ a wee tune of itâ€”â€ She rapped her knuckles lightly on the table, bump-ba-da-bump-ba-da-bump-bump-bump, and my heart turned over, recognizing the theme from The Lone Ranger, which Brianna had taught him.

â€œAnd after a moment,â€ Jenny went on, â€œa womanâ€™s voice calls out fierce, â€˜Whoâ€™s there?â€™ And Jamie says in the Gaidhlig, â€˜It is your father, my daughter, and a cold, wet, and hungry man he is, too.â€™ For it was raininâ€™ hammer handles and pitchforks, and we were both soaked to the skin.â€

She rocked back a little, enjoying the telling.

â€œThe door opens then, just a crack, and thereâ€™s Marsali wiâ€™ a horse pistol in her hand, and her two wee lasses behind her, fierce as archangels, each with a billet of wood, ready to crack a thief across his shins. They see the firelight shine on Jamieâ€™s face then, and all three of them let out skellochs like to wake the dead and fall upon him and drag him inside and all talkinâ€™ at once and greetinâ€™, askinâ€™ was he a ghost and why was he not drowned, and that was the first we learned that the Euterpe had sunk.â€ She crossed herself. â€œGod rest them, poor souls,â€ she said, shaking her head.

I crossed myself, too, and saw Mrs. Figg look sideways at me; she hadnâ€™t realized I was a Papist.

â€œIâ€™ve come in, too, of course,â€ Jenny went on, â€œbut everyoneâ€™s talkinâ€™ at once and rushinâ€™ to and fro in search of dry clothes and hot drinks and Iâ€™m just lookinâ€™ about the place, for Iâ€™ve never been inside a printshop before, and the smell of the ink and the paper and lead is a wonder to me, and, sudden-like, thereâ€™s a tug at my skirt and this sweet-faced wee mannie says to me, â€˜And who are you, madame? Would you like some cider?â€™ â€

â€œHenri-Christian,â€ I murmured, smiling at thought of Marsaliâ€™s youngest, and Jenny nodded.

â€œ â€˜Why, Iâ€™m your grannie Janet, son,â€™ says I, and his eyes go round, and he lets out a shriek and grabs me round the legs and gives me such a hug as to make me lose my balance and fall down on the settle. Iâ€™ve a bruise on my bum the size of your hand,â€ she added out of the corner of her mouth to me.

I felt a small knot of tension that I hadnâ€™t realized was there relax. Jenny did of course know that Henri-Christian had been born a dwarfâ€”but knowing and seeing are sometimes different things. Clearly they hadnâ€™t been, for Jenny.

Mrs. Figg had been following this account with interest, but maintained her reserve. At mention of the printshop, though, this reserve hardened a bit.

â€œThese folkâ€”Marsali is your daughter, then, maâ€™am?â€ I could tell what she was thinking. The entire town of Philadelphia knew that Jamie was a rebelâ€”and, by extension, so was I. It was the threat of my imminent arrest that had caused John to insist upon my marrying him in the wake of the tumult following Jamieâ€™s presumed death. The mention of printing in British-occupied Philadelphia was bound to raise questions as to just what was being printed, and by whom.

â€œNo, her husband is my brotherâ€™s adopted son,â€ Jenny explained. â€œBut I raised Fergus from a wee lad myself, so heâ€™s my foster son, as well, by the Highland way of reckoning.â€

Mrs. Figg blinked. She had been gamely trying to keep the cast of characters in some sort of order to this point, but now gave it up with a shake of her head that made the pink ribbons on her cap wave like antennae.

â€œWell, where the devilâ€”I mean, where on earth has your brother gone with his lordship?â€ she demanded. â€œTo this printshop, you think?â€

Jenny and I exchanged glances.

â€œI doubt it,â€ I said. â€œMore likely heâ€™s gone outside the city, using Johnâ€”er, his lordship, I meanâ€”as a hostage to get past the pickets, if necessary. Probably heâ€™ll let him go as soon theyâ€™re far enough away for safety.â€

Mrs. Figg made a deep humming noise of disapproval.

â€œAnd maybe heâ€™ll make for Valley Forge and turn him over to the rebels instead.â€

â€œOh, I shouldna think so,â€ Jenny said soothingly. â€œWhat would they want with him, after all?â€

Mrs. Figg blinked again, taken aback at the notion that anyone might not value his lordship to the same degree that she did, but after a momentâ€™s lip-pursing allowed as this might be so.

â€œHe wasnâ€™t in his uniform, was he, maâ€™am?â€ she asked me, brow furrowed. I shook my head. John didnâ€™t hold an active commission. He was a diplomat, though technically still lieutenant-colonel of his brotherâ€™s regiment, and therefore wore his uniform for purposes of ceremony or intimidation, but he was officially retired from the army, not a combatant, and in plain clothes he would be taken as citizen rather than soldierâ€”thus of no particular interest to General Washingtonâ€™s troops at Valley Forge.

I didnâ€™t think Jamie was headed for Valley Forge in any case. I knew, with absolute certainty, that he would come back. Here. For me.

The thought bloomed low in my belly and spread upward in a wave of warmth that made me bury my nose in my teacup to hide the resulting flush.

Alive. I caressed the word, cradling it in the center of my heart. Jamie was alive. Glad as I was to see Jennyâ€”and gladder still to see her extend an olive branch in my directionâ€”I really wanted to go up to my room, close the door, and lean against the wall with my eyes shut tight, reliving the seconds after heâ€™d entered the room, when heâ€™d taken me in his arms and kissed me, the simple, solid, warm fact of his presence so overwhelming that I might have collapsed onto the floor without his armsâ€™ support.

Alive, I repeated silently to myself. Heâ€™s alive.

Nothing else mattered. Though I did wonder briefly what heâ€™d done with John.
