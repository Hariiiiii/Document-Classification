Chapter 1


It was in the middle of the month of August

in 1957. All across American, the vast majority

of the young boys were growing up with dreams

of being pilots. Many teens recently bragged

how they were going to fly jets. They wanted to

be just like John Glenn. After all, Marine Major

John Glenn set a transcontinental record in July

of 1957 for a flight from Los Angeles to New

York in a F8 Crusader. But some boys had

dreams of flying other types of aircrafts like

helicopters.



The evening was cooling down in Glendale,

California to a comfortable seventy-two degrees.

All the young lads in that town were inside

homes with their eyes glued to their favorite TV

shows. Many had their eyes glued to the TV to

watch Gunsmoke with dreams of being

Cowboys or a famous Marshall.

But in the Grayson living room, young

Michael also had dreams of going on high-flying

adventures. He was one of those youths that

had dreams of being a helicopter pilot.



3

He was your typical blonde haired boy who

wore denim blue jeans, plaid colored shirts and

black converse sneakers. He sat in the middle

of the living room with his eyes glued to the

black and white Zenith brown wooden console

TV.

On the TV screen this evening was his

favorite show called Whirlybirds. This was a

helicopter adventure show where pilots Chuck

Martin and Pete (PT) Moore flew around saving

the day. He never missed an episode since the

show first aired in February. Tonight was the

new episode called Cycle of Terror.

Michael‟s eyes were glued to the tube while

the opening credits appeared with a Bell 47

helicopter flying through a rocky mountainous

area. This TV show sparked his dreams of

becoming a helicopter pilot when he would

become an grown man.

In the kitchen, Elaine Grayson, was

Michael‟s shapely blonde haired mother. She

had an apron around her dress and waited by

the oven. Inside it was baking cookies for

Michael to munch while he watched TV.

In the garage, Harry Grayson, was Michael‟s

brown haired crew cut father. He was tuning up

the V-8 engine of his green 1953 Chevrolet four-



4

door Bel-Air. He just finished wrenching in the

third new spark plug in the engine.

Harry had a Zenith transistor radio on the

workbench and the local country radio station

played the Chances Are song by Johnny Mathis.

Harry whistled along with Johnny Mathis

while he turned the wrench and started to

remove the fourth old spark plug from the

engine.

The garage door was opened and another

young boy, Kevin Coogan, with flaming red hair

with freckles sprinkled all over his pale skin, was

visible while he ran down the street toward the

Grayson home. Kevin was a regular at the

Grayson home in the evenings since his family

did not own a TV. Kevin was really glad

Michael‟s dad bought one last year.

Back in the kitchen, Elaine pulled the pan of

twelve mouth watering chocolate chip cookies

out of the oven. She placed the hot pan on the

top of the stove to give them a few minutes to

cool off.

She walked over and opened the

refrigerator. She reached inside and removed a

milk bottle and poured some into a glass. She

placed the milk bottle back into the refrigerator.

She walked over to the stove and scooped



5

up four of her delicious chocolate delights and

placed them on a plate.

She grabbed the glass of milk and plate then

walked out of the kitchen.

Elaine walked into the living room and over

to Michael.

He still sat on the floor with his eyes glued to

the Whirlybirds show. After placing the plate

and glass on the floor, she kissed Michael on

the top of his heard. “Don‟t spill your milk or get

crumbs on the floor,” Elaine reminded him while

she headed back to the kitchen.

“I won‟t,” responded Michael while his eyes

were still glued to the scene where Chuck and

PT just took off in their Bell 47G helicopter from

the airport.

Michael grabbed a cookie and took a bite

while he watched the Bell 47G ascend into the

sky.

Back in the kitchen, Elaine walked over to

the refrigerator, opened it up and removed a can

of Olympia beer.

She walked over to the counter by the sink

and removed a can opener from one of the

drawers. She heard a knock on the front door

while she opened the can of beer.

She walked out of the kitchen and went



6

through the living room to the front door out in

the hallway.

Michael was too involved in the Whirlybirds

show to answer the front door.

Elaine opened the front door and Kevin

Coogan was standing outside looking anxious.

“Hi Misses Grayson,” Kevin blurted out while

he bolted through the opening and bolted down

the hallway.

“Hello Kevin,” Elaine said with a light

chuckle. She closed the door and watched

while Kevin bolted into the living room.

Elaine walked back in the kitchen and

headed into the garage to give Harry his beer.

Kevin ran up to Michael. “Mom was late

with dinner,” Kevin said while he plopped down

by Michael‟s side.

Kevin snatched one of the cookies off the

plate and took a bite. “Did I miss much?” he

asked Michael while he had a mouth full of

cookie and watched the commercial for Post

Cereal.

“Naw. Some bad guys on motorcycles are

shooting at people. They shot at the Chuck and

PT while they were flying around,” Michael said

while he grabbed his glass of milk and took a

sip.



7

Kevin looked concerned. “Did they crash?”

“Naw. They‟re okay. Only hit the gas tank

and some gas leaked out,” Michal said while he

grabbed another cookie and took a bite.

Kevin looked relieved and wiped his

forehead with his left hand. “Whew. You scared

me.”

Elaine walked back into the living room with

four replacement chocolate chip cookies and

another glass of milk.

She dumped the cookies on the plate and

set Kevin‟s glass of milk in from of him.

Michael and Kevin‟s eyes were glued to the

TV when the Whirlybirds episode returned after

the commercial.

“Thank you Misses Grayson,” Kevin said

while he snatched up one of the cookies.

Elaine gave Kevin a loving smile then she

walked out of the kitchen.

Michael and Kevin immediately pretended

they were flying helicopters while they watched

the show.



A little later during the show, Michael and

Kevin sat in front of the TV. They both had two

sawed off broomsticks in their hands. One

broomstick was the cyclic control and the other



8

broomstick was the collective control. In their

minds, they were flying helicopters along with

Chuck while he chased after the bad guy on the

motorcycle.

“You can‟t get away,” Michael yel ed at the

TV.

“Let‟s get him,” Kevin called out from his

pretend helicopter.

On the TV, Chuck flew the Bell 47G inches

over the head of the motorcycle rider. The rider

hit the ground with his motorcycle and rolled

down an incline.

Chuck descended the Bell 47G and PT

jumped out and went after the motorcycle rider.

Michal and Kevin clapped and cheered

when PT and Chuck again stopped the villains.

Kevin jumped off the floor. “I gotta go

home,” he said while he watched the ending

Whirlybird credits.

“I‟l see ya tomorrow Kevin,” Michael said

while he stood up and collected the two plates

and glasses.

Kevin ran out of the living room.

Inside the kitchen, Elaine was finishing up

with a little light cleaning of the counter tops.

“Good night Misses Grayson,” Kevin was

heard while he ran out and slammed the front



9

door closed.

“Time for bed, Michael,” Elaine said while he

walked into the kitchen.

“Can't I stay up late?” Michael said while he

handed her the two plates and glasses.

“Best you get to bed early, since you're hard

to wake up in the morning,” she said.

Michael looked disappointed while he

walked away and headed down the hallway.

“Pick up those broomsticks in the living

room,” she said while he headed out of the

kitchen. She knew it was a tradition of Michael

and Kevin to use them while pretending to fly

helicopters.

Elaine placed the plates and glasses in the

sink and started washing them by hand.



Later that night, Michael had the covers

pulled over his head. He used a flashlight to

read his favorite magazine, which was the June

10th issue of Life magazine about a helicopter

safari. Michael loved this article since it had

pictures of the Bell 47G helicopter.



The next day arrived and Michael and Kevin

decided to play in the backyard since it was a

sunny day.



10

The episode of last night‟s Whirlybird show

was still engrained in their minds and stirred

their imaginations.

So they played their usual game where

Michael would climb and sit on top of one of the

thick metal clothesline pole with his two

broomsticks. He would use the horizontal pole

for his seat of his imaginary Bell 47B helicopter.

Sometimes, Kevin would sit on the other

clothesline pole and fly his imagina ry Bell 47G in

formation. But today, Kevin sat on his bicycle

pretending to be the bad guy causing terror with

his motorcycle.

The boys started reacting last nights Cycle

of Terror Whirlybird episode.

Kevin rode his bicycle in circles around the

clothesli ne pole.

Michael made helicopter sounds while he

looked down at Kevin. “You can‟t get away from

me, as I always get the bad guys.”

“You‟l never catch me whirlybird man,”

Kevin yelled out while he rode circles around the

clothesline pole.

“I‟l get you because I‟m the best helicopter

pilot in the whole world!” Michael yelled down at

Kevin then made more helicopter sounds.

Michael leaned to his right side to bank his



11

imaginary 47G to the right.



From the kitchen window, Elaine washed

dishes in the kitchen sink wearing her yellow

rubber gloves. While she scrubbed a breakfast

plate, she glanced out the window to check up

on the boys. She cracked a joyful smile when

she saw the boys playing and glanced down at

the dish she was washing. Her eyes lit up with

an idea.

She rushed out of the kitchen and headed

down the hallway to her bedroom.

A few minutes later, Elaine returned with her

Kodak Signet 30 camera in hand.

She rushed back to the kitchen window and

snapped a picture of Michael and Kevin playing.

She snapped another picture for Kevin‟s

parents. She set the camera down on the

counter then glanced out the window just in time

to see Michael while he leaned to his left to bank

his imaginary 47G. He leaned too far and fell

off the pole. Her eyes widened in fear when she

saw him fall. Her body tensed up her body the

second Michael slammed hard on the ground.

“Michael!” she yelled out then dropped the dish

into the hot water in the sink.

Elaine ran out over to the back door in the



12

kitchen.



Out in the backyard, Michael lay in the grass

in pain.

Kevin jumped off his bicycle and ran over

concerned to his best friend. “Are you okay?”

“My arm hurts! Really bad,” Michael cried

out in pain while he favored his right arm.

Elaine ran over to Michael and immediately

knelt down by Michael‟s side.

“My arm hurts, mommy. Real y bad,” he

cried out in pain.

Elaine got Michael up on his feet and rushed

him back to the house.

Kevin looked worried while he stood in the

yard and watched Michael go back inside with

Elaine. He walked over and picked up his

bicycle and headed back to his house.



Later that evening, Michael sat on the floor

and watched TV with his right arm in a cast.

Harry worked as an animator for Disney and

took a break from his work in the garage. He

quickly drew up a cartoon of a pilot falling out of

a helicopter on Michael‟s cast.



Michael started the fall term at school in



13

September and he was somewhat of a hero with

that cast on his arm.

Michael and Kevin were inseparable during

the rest of their high school years. They spent

their summers turning their skins bronze, surfing

and chasing after the sexy bikini clad girls at the

Santa Monica Pier. But becoming a helicopter

pilot was still a dream of Michael‟s. He knew he

could accomplish that dream by joining the US

Army. Because of this, he would take countless

rides on the Ferris wheel on the Santa Monica

Pier for that feeling he was flying in the sky.



After Michel and Kevin graduated from high

school in June of 1968. After graduation they

spent two weeks at the Santa Monica Beach

and tried their best to inside the bikinis‟ of sexy

tanned girls. That did not happen. But Kevin

did meet Nancy Myers and he fell deeply in love.

It was now late June and Michael was now

old enough to enlist in the Army without his

parents permission.

Elaine was upset but Harry was proud that

his son wanted to serve for his country. But

deep down inside, he was a little nervous with

the potential that Michael could be sent to

Vietnam. In fact, he knew that there was a high



14

potential he would be sent over there.

Kevin opted not to join since he just started

a loving relationship with Nancy and he got a job

at a local grocery store stocking shelves. He

had plans on working his way up to one of the

manager‟s slot then he would marry Nancy in a

few years.



On Monday July 15th, 1968, Michael left for

Army boot camp at Ford Ord in California.

It was ten weeks of a rude awakening for

Michael. Everybody was dressed the same in

those plain green fatigues. They all had the

same buzzed haircuts. And they all lost their

privacy with sleeping while they slept in

individual bunks in a huge opened aired room.

Plus taking a shower with other guys was

awkward, especially if you were not blessed

down in the groin department. So Michael

endured his training missing his mother, father

and best friend Kevin.

While Michael was enduring boot camp,

Elaine would lay awake at nights thinking about

her little baby. Then she recalled those

sleepless nights when Harry was in the Air

Force stationed in Korea during the Korean War.

Even though he worked for the Stars and Stripes



15

newspaper, she still worried the communist

might take away the love of her life.

Harry was still concerned that Michael would

be sent to Vietnam but tried to believe that this

was his son‟s duty to stop the evil communist

aggression over in Vietnam and then possibility

the United States. He and Elaine never

mentioned the Vietnam possibility to each other.

Chapter 2


After completing basic training, Michael

successfully passed the qualification exams and

was accepted to learn how to fly helicopters in

the US Army. Michael was in heaven, as his

childhood dream of becoming a helicopter pilot

was closer to becoming reality.

Michael‟s next assignment was at Fort

Wolters located four miles northeast of Mineral

Wells in Texas.

It was Monday, September 30th and Michael

was excited while the bus drove through the

main gate that had an orange Hughes 269

(Army designation was the TH-55 Osage)

helicopter on a brown stone pedestal to the right

with an arched gate over the road that stated

“US Army, Primary Helicopter Center, Fort

Wolters, Texas” that lead to a green and orange

Hiller Model 360 (Army designation was the OH-

23 Raven) helicopter on another brown stone

pedestal.

All the young men on the bus were elated

and eager to start their training in helicopters.



17

They stepped off the silver MCI bus with

their suitcases in hand and huge grins.

They headed off to the Administration

building to get processed into the base.

Michael was assigned to class 68-45a-1 and

he was on his first step with starting his primary

helicopter flight training as a Warrant Officer

Candidate.



During the preflight training days, Michael

and the other candidates marched to class.

Preflight training consisted of classroom

instruction where they learned the basics of

aerodynamics and other military aviation items.

Michael hated the bookwork but knew it was a

requirement he could not avoid.



November 1968 rolled around and Michael

was finished with his preflight training. He was

ready to start with his four-month primary flight

training at Fort Wolters.

It was a warm day and the temperature was

sixty-eight degrees. Michael stood out in

formation outside his barracks with forty-nine

other Warrant Officer Candidates in their

fatigues. Some of these candidates were

Michael‟s age and some were a little older with a



18

few years of Army experience under their belts.

But now they all looked alike while they wore

yellow baseball caps to indicate their class color.

Michael stood next to his new friend Eric Wilson.

Eric was the same age as Michael and was

from Burbank, California. Since they were both

from California, they immediately became best

of friends during preflight. This helped them

overcome their occasional feelings of being

homesick. Like Michael, Eric was also an avid

fan of the old Whirlybirds TV show. And that

show also sparked his dreams of flying

helicopters.

While the candidates stood in formation, the

flapping of blades and sights of some TH-55

Osage helicopters flying over head made their

mouths water. They all were inching to get their

hands on the controls of a copter.



A few minutes later, a green Army

International bus drove up and stopped by the

formation. The door opened and SSG Vincent

“Vinny” Moore stepped off the bus looking so

tough.

Vinny was an Army lifer with two years left

until he was eligible to retire. He sported a crew

cut that did not hide his bald patches. His



19

fatigues were starched with creases that

appeared sharp as a knife. His black combat

boots were spit polished to a shine that acted

like a mirror.

“Okay Candidates. I‟m Sergeant Moore and

I‟m going to take you to the flight line,” Vinny

said in a raised voice while he glared at the

formation of candidates. “So get on my fucking

bus!”

Michael, Eric and the other candidates stood

with a look of disbelief that Moore acted like a

Drill Instructor. They thought their basic training

days of being treated like crap at were long

gone.

“And I mean now!” Vinny screamed at the

candidates using his old Drill Instructor voice

and spraying spit at some of the faces of the

candidates.

Moore glared at the candidates while they

scrambled over to the bus like a bunch of boot

camp recruits.

After the last candidate stepped on the bus,

Vinny stepped on the bus and the doors closed.

The pimply-faced Army Corporal drove the

bus away down the street.





20

Inside the bus were widened eyes and

smiles while the candidates chattered amongst

each other about flying helicopters.

Vinny sat in the seat behind the driver. He

rolled his eyes when he heard all the excitement

with flying helicopters. It was an all too familiar

sound he was not fond of hearing over and over

again.

Michael and Eric sat side by side in one of

the two persons seats.

“I can‟t believe I‟m final y going to fly a

chopper. I‟ve been waiting for this moment

since I was a kid,” Michael told Eric.

“I could tel you love helicopters by how you

aced al those tests,” Eric replied.

“Yeah, I‟ve been studying everything I could

about those machines since I was nine years

old,” Michael said with a gleam in his eyes while

he simulated that his right hand was on the

cyclic control while his left hand was on the

col ective control. “I‟l be flying that baby within

the first hour of having my hands her controls. I

should have my wings by the end of the week,”

he added with an air of arrogance.

A candidate sitting in the seat behind

Michael rolled his eyes when he heard his

arrogant claim.



21

“Maybe I should be taking lessons from

you,” Eric said while he played along with his

friend‟s arrogance.

“Don‟t worry. I‟ll give you some pointers my

friend,” Michael added and looked serious.

That same candidate sitting in the seat

behind Michael rolled his eyes again and looked

at the guy sitting next him. That candidate rolled

his eyes indicating he also heard Michael‟s

arrogance.



The bus drove down the flightline of the

Downing heliport with all the candidates

chattering up a storm with eyes big and bright.



The eyes of the candidates in the bus lit up

and their mouths drooled the second they saw a

sea of Hiller (OH-23 Raven) and Hughes (TH-55

Osage) helicopters parked in perfect formation

on the flightline.

The bus drove down the flight line with the

candidates almost wetting their pants at the

sight of all those helicopters.



The bus stopped by a large building and the

Corporal driver opened up the doors.



22

“Get the fuck off my bus!” Moore yelled at

the candidates.

All the candidates jumped up and ran off the

bus with Vinny right behind them.



Outside the large doors of the building,

Captain Bill Ernst was the flight leader and

watched while his candidates ran off the bus

with a clipboard in hand.

The candidates stood in formation.

Vinny walked up to Ernst. “Here‟s your fresh

candidates, sir,” he said then saluted.

Ernst saluted back and looked at the

formation of young kids.

“Listen up. I‟m your flight leader Captain Bil

Ernst. Now, the first order of business is for

each of you to take your hats off and wear it

backwards,” Ernst told the formation while he

walked back and forth in front of the front line.

Michael and Eric looked at each other

thinking that was stupid.

“What the hell is that al about?” Michael

leaned over and quietly asked Eric.

“Beats me,” Eric quietly replied back.

“Do it now!” Vinny hollered at the candidates

the second he realized they were stalling.



23

The candidates quickly obeyed Sergeant

Moore and placed their yellow baseball caps on

backwards.

“Now, you‟ll always wear your hat in this

configuration while on my flight line. You‟ll wear

it this way until you solo. And then you‟ll be

authorized to wear it in the proper configuration,”

Ernst addressed the candidates. He glanced at

his clipboard then glanced at the candidates. “I

want you to go over to those tables and get your

flight gear starting from left to right. Then get

back into formation,” he added while he pointed

back inside the hangar.

The candidates looked inside the building

and saw numerous tables lined up in a straight

line. On the tables were all sorts of flight gear

with some young enlisted men waiting behind

the table to assist.

The candidates started marching into the

hangar and over to the tables.

Vinny stood in the doorway and watched the

candidates. “I can‟t wait for my orders to come

through,” he quietly talked to himself, as he

hated this assignment in Texas. He longed for

some real action. After all, he was previously

trained to kill. He had the irresistible inch to put

his old training to work on our new enemy.



24



A little while later, the candidates were back

in formation outside the building. They had a

flight suit, flight helmet, flight gloves, flight

computer, sunglasses, student notebook,

Hughes operators, flight training manual, and

owners manual for a TH-55 helicopter, Army

Primary Helicopter School Student Information

Note Book, and a couple of other textbooks on

helicopters.

“Look at al this cool gear,” Michael leaned

over and quietly told Eric.

“This sure beats being issued combat gear,”

Eric quietly replied.

Michael nodded in agreement. “We‟re lucky

we get to fly a chopper,” Michael quietly added.

Eric nodded in agreement with sparkles in

his eyes.



A little while later, Ernst had the candidates

back in one of the rooms of the building sitting at

assigned seats arranged in small groups.

Ernst stood in the front of the room facing

the candidates. Then he started pacing around

for a short distance.

“Today wil begin your flight training. You‟l

meet your instructor pilots shortly,” Ernst



25

addressed the candidates while he paced back

and forth. He stopped and looked at the

candidates. “Now, I only have one requirement

and that being you don‟t fuck up any of my

copters. We have over twelve hundred

helicopters here at Fort Wolters and I don‟t want

you crashing them,” he said then stopped pacing

and looked the candidates square in their eyes.

“Do you understand?”

“Yes sir,” al the candidates sang out in

unison.

Ernst hesitated for a few seconds while he

stared at the door of the room. The door

opened.

Instructor Pilots (IP) walked inside. Some of

the IPs were civilians and wore the standard

green Army flight suits, and worked for Southern

Airways of Texas. There were also some Army

Warrant Officer instructors.

“Gentlemen, here are your new students,”

Ernst told the IPs while they stood in the back of

the room.

The IPs broke off in different directions and

headed to the tables in search of their students.

IP George Perry started his helicopter

career in the Army during the Korean War. He

flew the Bell 47 and ferried wounded soldiers



26

from the battlefield to a Mobile Army Surgical

Hospital (MASH). IP Perry retired from the Army

in 1966 and started working for Southern

Airways as an instructor pilot in Fort Wolters.

IP Perry walked up to the table where

Michael and Eric sat when he realized he

located his students.

“Hello gentlemen. I‟l be your instructor pilot.

My name is George Perry. Now tell me who you

are.”

“I‟m Michael Grayson.”

“I‟m Eric Wilson.”

“I‟m Bruce Weston.”

“I‟m Calvin Jones.”

“Okay. Today will be your first lesson. I will

take each of you up and let you get a feel for the

controls of the chopper. Are there any

questions?”

The guys shook their heads indicating they

did not, as they were too anxious to fly than sit

around and ask questions.

“Okay then. Let‟s go up in the sky,” said IP

Perry said while he started walking off to the

door.

Michael and the rest of the guys stood up

and followed IP Perry out of the room with

childish grins.



27

“Man. I‟m getting a boner thinking about

flying in a copter,” Michael said with sparkles in

his eyes.

“I‟m starting to worry about you,” Eric replied

while they walked out of the room with IP Perry.



The candidates walked with IP Perry out of

the building.

IP Perry stopped by the corner of the

building.

“Grayson will be my first victim and the rest

of you can ride the bus over to the stagefield.

We‟l be at one cal ed Ramrod,” said IP Perry

while he pointed at the waiting Army bus.

Michael had a huge grin on his face while he

strutted over to IP Perry.

“Are you ready?”

“Since I was eight years old,” Michael

replied with an ear-to-ear grin.

“Let‟s crank her up,” IP Perry replied with a

smirk, as he‟s seen these kids before that

thought flying a helicopter was an easy task.

Michael and IP Perry walked over to the

flightline and headed over to the formation of

helicopters.

“Show him how it‟s done,” Eric called out to

Michael.



28

Michael turned around and gave Eric two

thumbs up sign with a huge grin.

IP Perry glanced back at Michael and saw

his two thumbs up sign. “This is going to be

fun,” he quietly muttered to himself.

While IP Perry and Michael walked to the

TH-55 chopper, Eric, Bruce, and Calvin walked

over to that bus that would take them over to the

Ramrod stage field.

Michael was in heaven while IP Perry

walked him over to a parked TH-55 helicopter.

Michael walked behind IP Perry while he

walked past the tail rotor of the right side of the

copter.

“We‟re going to be best friends,” Michael

said quietly to himself while he ran his hand

along the tail boom of the copter.

“What?” IP Perry said while he glanced back

at Michael.

“Oh nothing.”

IP Perry stopped at the door of the right side

of the copter. “We‟l first start with the pre-flight

inspection. Just watch me and learn,” IP Perry

said then he reached inside the copter and

removed the preflight inspection book. He

opened up the book.



29

Michael shadowed IP Perry while he

explained what he was looking for during the

preflight inspection to insure the copter was safe

for flying.

While they preflight the copter, the rest of

Michael‟s cohorts were on the bus and heading

out to the Ramrod stage field.



30





Chapter 3


Fifteen minutes had passed and IP Perry

completed the pre-flight inspection of the TH-55

chopper. Michael learned the process.

Michael got in the right seat while IP Perry

got in the left seat. The shoved their flight

helmets over their heads then buckled their

harnesses and made sure they were snug.

“Now remember, this wil be your

introduction flight just to give you a feel for the

controls,” IP Perry told Michael.

“Yes sir,” Michael replied while he stared at

the control console and all the instruments.

“Okay, let‟s first start off by giving you a

quick rundown of the controls. First we have the

cyclic that‟s between your legs,” IP Perry said

while he placed his hand on the cyclic control

between Michael‟s legs. “This control tilts the

main rotor for turning and attitude control,” he

said then placed his hand on the throttle grip of

the collective to the left of his seat. “This is the

collective with throttle control. This will control

the pitch angle of the rotor blades for ascending

and descending,” he said then he pointed at the



31

two pedals by his boots. “Those are the anti-

torque pedals for control ing yaw,” IP Perry

added then looked at Michael. “Any questions?”

he said.

“No sir,” replied Michael, as he already knew

the basics of the controls of a helicopter from all

those books he read as a youngster.

IP Perry removed the cockpit card from a

sleeve on the left side of the console and

handed it to Michael. “Okay, follow along while I

start up this beautiful piece of machinery,” IP

Perry said.

“Yes sir,” Michael replied while he glanced

down at the card.

After a few minutes of following IP Perry‟s

movements and reading the cockpit card, the

engine was started and the blades started

rotating.

Michael placed the card back in its sleeve

on the side of the console.



A little while later, the blades were rotating

at the proper speed and all the instruments

readings were acceptable. IP Perry lifted the

skids of the TH-55 off the flightline.



32

The TH-55 hovered for a few seconds then

IP Perry moved it sideways out of its parking

spot.

IP Perry turned the TH-55 taxied four feet off

the ground down the flightline.

IP Perry hovered the TH-55 in line with eight

other helicopters while they waited for clearance

from the tower to ascend out of the area.

Clearance from the tower finally came and

Michael‟s heart raced while IP Perry ascended

the TH-55 up into the air.

From inside the TH-55, IP Perry gave

Michael a play by play of the procedures while

he ascended the TH-55 into the eastern traffic

pattern away from the heliport.

Michael was in heaven while IP Perry flew

the TH-55 eighteen hundred feet above the Fort

Wolters area and headed southeast. He loved

the view from the chopper while they rose higher

into the air. He was also in awe of the vast

open countryside Texas had to offer, since his

home town was in the Los Angeles area.



A little while later, IP Perry flew the TH-55

chopper to stage field number three called

Ramrod.



33

“Up ahead is stagefield Ramrod. We‟l head

down there and start your training,” IP Perry told

Michael while he pointed at the stage field.

Michael looked and saw a field with six

lanes, a control tower and a hut for the students

to hang out.

“Okay, lanes one, two, four, and five are

used for take-offs and landings and lanes three

and six are used for autorotation practice,” IP

Perry told Michael.

IP Perry then gave Michael a play by play of

the procedure for descending while he headed

toward Ramrod field and headed to the line of

trees along the one side.

Michael saw two Hughes TH-55 and two

Hiller TH-23 helicopters hovering and facing

some trees. All four helicopters were all over

the place while they attempted to hover above

the ground.

IP Perry descended the TH-55 down to the

field and gave Michael the play by play of the

procedures for landing.

The skids of the TH-55 touched down in the

grass. The engine got quieter and the blades

slowed down a bit.

“See that tree with the red ribbon around it

straight ahead?” IP Perry asked Michael.



34

“Yes sir,” Michael replied while he looked

straight ahead.

“I‟m going to hover about five feet off the

ground. When I tell you, I want you to use the

anti-torque pedals at your feet to keep the

chopper pointed straight at that red ribbon. You

should remember which pedal does what.

Right?”

“A piece of cake,” Michael replied in a cocky

tone.

“We‟l see,” IP Perry replied quietly picking

up on Michael‟s cockiness.

The engine of the TH-55 got louder and the

blades spun around faster.

IP Perry lifted the TH-55 up off the ground

and was soon hovering perfectly still a little over

four feet off the ground. It was pointed straight

at the red ribbon tied to the tree.

“You got the pedals now,” IP Perry told

Michael.

Michael placed his boots on the anti-torque

pedals.

The TH-55 drifted to the right from the red

ribbon tree.

Michael pushed on the left pedal.



35

The tail of the TH-55 swung over to the left.

The tree with the red ribbon moved to Michael‟s

left.

“Crap!” Michael said and sounded frustrated

and pushed in on the right pedal.

The tail of the TH-55 swung over to the right.

The tree with red ribbon now moved over to

Michael‟s right.

“What the hell are you doing? I said keep it

pointed straight at that tree with the red ribbon.

You do remember what the function of those

pedals? Don‟t you?” IP Perry said in a raised

voice because Michael sounded cocky at first.

“Yes sir,” Michael replied while he pushed in

the left pedal.

The tail of the TH-55 swung to the left. The

tree with the red ribbon again moved to

Michael‟s left.

Crap! Michael yelled said inside his head.



After ten minutes of over correcting the

drifts, Michael finally got the tail of the TH-55 to

make smaller swings and the tree with the red

ribbon also made smaller moves.

“I got the pedals,” IP Perry told Michael.



36

Michael removed his boots from the pedals

and IP Perry took control of them. The TH-55

stayed perfectly straight at the red ribbon tree.

“Next I‟m going to let you have control of the

cyclic and I want you to keep us pointed at the

red ribbon tree,” IP Perry told Michael.

“Yes sir,” Michael replied and did not sound

so cocky this time.

“Okay, it‟s your cyclic,” IP Perry said the

second he saw Mike had his right ha nd on the

cyclic control. IP Perry released his grip of the

control but kept his hand close by in case

Michael really screwed up.

The TH-55 immediately moved forward.

Michael moved the cyclic back.

The TH-55 moved backwards and to the

right.

Michael moved the cyclic forward and to the

left while beads of sweat started forming on his

face.

The TH-55 moved forward and to the left too

much. Michael‟s hands started to get sweaty

while he tried to correct his error. He over

corrected again and felt like screaming.

This pattern continued for a little and

indicated Michael had very little control of the

chopper.



37

“What the hell are you doing?”

Beads of sweat poured down Michael‟s

cheeks. “I‟m trying to fly this thing. It must be

broken,” Michael replied while the TH-55 was all

over the place.

“I got control of the cyclic,” IP Perry told

Michael and placed his hand back on the cyclic

control.

Michael removed his hand while more beads

of sweat ran down his face.

The TH-55 was immediately in a perfect

hover and pointed straight at the red ribbon tree.

“I‟m going to let you have control of the

col ective. I‟l work the throttle. You just grip the

collective below it. I want you to keep us about

four feet above the ground. Do you

understand?” IP Perry asked Michael.

Michael hesitated for a few seconds while

he was suddenly nervous. “Yes sir,” he replied

in a quieter tone and gripped the collective

below the throttle.

“You got the collective,” IP Perry said.

The TH-55 hovered about four feet off the

ground.

Then the TH-55 rose up a couple of feet.

Michael pushed down on the collective

control.



38

The TH-55 dropped down to the ground.

“Don‟t hit the ground,” IP Perry yelled out.

Michael pulled up on the collective control.

The TH-55 rose up to six feet above the

ground.

“I said four feet off the ground,” IP Perry

yelled.

More beads of sweat dripped down

Michael‟s face while he pulled up on the

collective. The Bell rose up to about eight feet.

“Do you know up from down?” IP Perry

yelled.

Michael lowered the collecti ve and the TH-

55 sunk down to the ground.

“Don‟t hit the dirt,” IP Perry yelled out.

Crap! Michael yelled inside his head while

he pulled up on the collective. The Bell rose up

to about eight feet off the ground.

After ten minutes of the TH-55 going up and

down, Michael was finally able to keep the

chopper between four and six feet off the

ground.

“I got the collective,” IP Perry said and

hovered the TH-55 perfectly four feet above the

ground.

“Now for the grand finale. Are you ready to

take all the controls?” IP Perry asked Michael.



39

Michael looked real y nervous. “I think so.”

“When flying a helicopter, you better be sure

you‟re ready. Are you ready?” IP Perry replied

and sounded more like a drill instructor.

“Yes sir.”

“Place your hands and boots on all the

controls,” IP Perry said.

Michael placed his hands and boots on all of

the controls and took a deep breath.

“Okay, you have control of the chopper,” IP

Perry said and removed his hands and boots

from his controls, but kept them close by in case

Michael screwed up.

The TH-55 rose up. Michael lowered the

collective.

The TH-55 dropped to the ground. Michael

raised the collective

The TH-55 rose up and moved to the right.

Michael moved the cyclic to the left and

inadvertently lowered the collective .

The TH-55 dropped and moved to the left.

Michael raised the collective and moved the

cyclic to the right.

The TH-55 rose up and to the right. Michael

moved the cyclic to the left and raised the

collective.



40

The TH-55 moved forward to the left and

rose in the air. Michael moved the cyclic

backwards and to the right and inadvertently

pressed on the right pedal.

The TH-55 started moving backwards and

started to spin to the right.

“I got control of the chopper,” IP Perry said

then took over. The TH-55 stayed in a perfect

hover four feet off the ground the second IP

Perry took over the controls.

Sweat poured out of Michael‟s pores and he

looked like he wanted to cry.

“That‟s enough for today,” IP Perry said then

he turned the TH-55 around and taxied over

toward the control tower and hut.



41





Chapter 4


A little while later, IP Perry landed the TH-55

on the tarmac facing the hut.

“Tel Wilson he‟s next. He should be over in

the hut,” IP Perry said while he noticed the Army

bus parked by the side of the hut.

Michael nodded that he understood the IPs

instructions.

“And keep your head down. I don‟t want to

fill out paperwork explaining why it sliced your

head clean off your shoulders,” IP Perry jokingly

said while he idled the helicopter.

The blades of the TH-55 slowed down and

Michael unbuckled his harness and carefully got

out.

Michael ducked down while he rushed over

to the hut.

He stopped by the hut door, turned around

and glanced back at the TH-55. “Why do you

hate me?” he said quietly and still looked like he

wanted to cry.



Michael walked inside the hut and removed

his flight helmet.



42

He looked around the hut and saw tables

where the other candidates anxiously waited for

their first lesson in the helicopter.

“Eric, you‟re next,” Michael called out the

second he spotted the table where Eric, Bruce,

and Calvin waited.

Eric jumped up with his flight helmet in hand

from one of the tables and rushed over to the

door.

Michael walked over to the tables looking

like he lost his puppy.

Eric rushed out of the door almost tripping

over his combat boots.

“How was it?” Bruce asked Michael with a

sparkle in his eyes.

“Is it easy to fly?” Calvin asked with a

sparkle in his eyes.

Michael did not reply right away while he sat

down at the table. “It‟s exhausting. That‟s al I

can say,” he finally said and remained tight-

lipped while he looked depressed. He wiped the

sweat off his forehead with the right sleeve of his

flight suit.

Michael remained quiet during the wait time

in the hut while Eric had his first lesson. Bruce

and Calvin were chatterboxes while they talked



43

about their future glorious times flying

helicopters.



Thirty minutes had passed and the sound of

the TH-55 was heard while it descended back to

the flightline.



A little while later, Eric strutted into the hut

and grinned ear-to-ear.

“Weston, you‟re next,” Eric said while he

strutted over to the table with his huge grin still

stuck on his face.

Bruce jumped up with his flight helmet in

hand.

“That was awesome,” Eric said while he sat

down next to Michael.

Bruce rushed out of the hut with his flight

helmet on his head.

Eric looked over at Michael who looked ever

so depressed while he stared down at the floor.

“How did you do? I can imaging you showed

that IP a thing or two.”

“Naw. I was all over the fucking place. I

couldn‟t keep her stil . I couldn‟t believe it. I

thought it would be so easy. I don‟t know that

went wrong. I‟ve been practicing the use of

those controls in my mind for years,” Michael



44

said and his inability to fly the helicopter seemed

so surreal.

“Don‟t worry. I also sucked at flying it. I

heard that it gets easier every time you go up,”

Eric replied and patted Michael on his shoulder

to show his support.

“I sure hope so. I real y do,” Michael said

and started to have serious doub ts he is lacking

the talent to fly a helicopter.

Michael remained quiet while Bruce and

Calvin went up in the helicopter for their lesson.



Later on that day, Vinny stepped inside the

hut. “Okay ladies, time to get back on the bus,”

he told everybody in the hut.

“Where‟s Calvin?” Eric asked.

“I believe he flew the TH-55 back to the

main heliport with IP Perry,” Bruce replied.

Michael, Bruce, Eric, and the other

candidates walked out of the hut and headed to

the bus.

Minutes later, all the candidates boarded the

bus and ere exhausted from their first lessons.

Plus they all had huge sweat stains on the back

of their fatigue shirts.

It was a different ride o the bus back to their

barracks. It was quiet. All eyes of the



45

candidates were exhausted. Some had huge

sweat stains under their armpits. Michael still

pouted. He thought his life was over.



After some chow at the Chow Hall, most of

the candidates wanted to head out for some fun.

The barracks was busy while the candidates

changed into fresh khaki uniforms. It was time

to relax for the evening.

“Michael, don‟t you want to head out to the

movies?” Eric said when he spotted Michael in

his bunk wearing only his fatigue pants, white

tee shirt and head buried into a book.

“Naw, I‟m going to stay in tonight and do

some serious studying,” Michael replied while he

held up one the operator‟s manual for a TH-55.

“The Green Berets movie is playing at the

base theater. Bruce and Calvin are going,” Eric

replied.

“It‟s important that I do some more

studying,” Michael replied then went back to

reading his operator‟s manual.

“But it‟s a John Wayne movie with Huey‟s,”

Eric pleaded as a last attempt.

Michael ignored him while he kept his head

buried into his book.



46

“You‟re not expected to be perfect during the

first lesson. It takes practice,” Eric said to

hopefully change his mind.

“Have fun,” Michael said while he continued

to read his book.

Eric knew it was useless so he walked away

and met up with Bruce and Calvin.



A few hours had passed and Michael fell

fast asleep with the TH-55 operator‟s manual on

his chest. He started dreaming.



In Michael‟s dream, he was flying a TH-55

helicopter five hundred feet over the countryside

fifteen miles east of Fort Wolters.

The TH-55 was all over the place.

It flew up one hundred feet.

It flew down three hundred feet.

It made a steep banked turn to the right.

It made a steep banked turn to the left.

It started spinning around in a circle.

It started flying backwards with the bubble

aimed upward.

It started spinning around in a circle.

Michael looked scared to death while he lost

control of the helicopter and it spinning out of

control all over the sky.



47

The TH-55 started spinning down toward a

large clump of trees.

Michael froze in fear while he saw the tree

branches approaching fast at the bubble.

Michael moved the cyclic and collective

controls but the bubble of the TH-55 still

smacked into the trees.

The TH-55 started falling bubble first to the

ground but then the tail rotor got snagged

around some tree branches.

It hung upside down.

Michael looked down at the ground that was

twenty feet below.

All of a sudden, he saw IP Perry staring up

at him from down below. “You‟re eliminated!” IP

Perry yelled in a dreamy voice while he pointed

up at the crashed chopper hanging from the

trees.

Michael looked down at IP Perry and wanted

to cry.

He then heard the laughter of his nine

candidates while they all walked over and stood

by IP Perry. They all pointed up at Michael.

“You‟re eliminated,” al the candidates yel ed

out while they pointed up at Michael and started

laughing.





48

Back to reality, Michael woke up to the

sound of laughter of his fellow candidates while

they were coming back from an evening of

relaxation.

Michael looked around the barracks in a

daze.

It took a few seconds for him to realize that

he crashed a chopper in a dream.

“You missed a great movie,” Eric said while

he walked up to Michael‟s bunk.

“I know, but I real y needed to study this

operator‟s manual,” Michael replied then

yawned.

“Looks like you read the book with your eyes

closed.”

“I fell asleep,” Michael replied then got up

from his bunk, got his toothbrush and tooth

paste out of his locker and headed to the latrine.

Twenty minutes later, Michael was back

asleep in his bunk in his white boxers and tee

shirt. He started another dream.



In his second dream, Michael wore fatigues

with Private stripes and a combat helmet. He

walked through the jungle with four other ground

pounders.



49

Bullets started dancing al around Michael‟s

combat boots.

He turned around and the other four soldiers

ran away. Michael was in the jungle all alone

while more bullets danced all around his combat

boots.

Michael ran through the jungle in a panic

where bullets zinged through the nearby

vegetation.

Michael almost peed his pants while those

zinging bullets started racing inches past his

helmet.

Eight bullets ricocheted off his helmet. He

stopped dead in his tracks scared to death.

His eyes widened in fear when he saw five

Vietcong dressed in black outfits in front of him

with Russian AK-47 rifles in hand.

“You‟re eliminated,” one of the Vietcong

called in broken English.

“You‟re eliminated,” the rest of the Vietcong

called out in unison in broken English.

All the Vietcong laughed and pointed at

Michael. They stopped laughing, got serious

then aimed their rifles at him.

Michael was frozen in fear.

They all fired their AK-37s at the same time

and the sound of gunfire echoed in the jungle.



50



Back to reality, Michael jumped up in his

bunk in a sweaty panic. He looked around for

any Vietcong then realized he had a bad dream.

He looked relieved while he lay back down on

his bunk, but was a little nervous about falling

asleep and having more bad dreams.

He was soon fast asleep. The dreams did

not return for the remainder of the night.

Chapter 5


The sun rose in Mineral Wells area for the

start of another day of training at Fort Wolters.

After breakfast, Michael joined Eric, Bruce,

and Calvin on the bus that headed back to the

Downing heliport.

A little while later, Michael, Eric, Bruce, and

Calvin waited outside that large building at the

heliport.

“Good morning. Let‟s have Wilson fly with

me to the stagefield Ramrod this time. The rest

of you can ride the bus over there,” IP Perry said

while he walked up to the four candidates.

Eric walked away with IP Perry to the TH-55

helicopter.

Michael, Bruce, and Calvin walked over to

the bus along with the other candidates.



It was a quiet nervous ride for Michael while

the bus drove over to the stagefield Ramrod.

His mind was filled with thoughts of screwing up

again.





52

A little while later, the bus parked by the hut

at the stagefield Ramrod. The bus doors

opened and all the candidates filed out and

walked over to the hut.

Some of them stopped at the door of the hut

and looked at the stagefield. They had sparkles

in their eyes while they saw numerous

helicopters practicing hovering techniques.

Michael went inside the hut with his TH-55

manual in hand like a schoolboy.



While Michael waited in the hut, he studied

the crap out of his manual. He also started to

get nervous when he was the last one to take a

lesson today.

“I‟m going to be eliminated. I just know it,”

he muttered quietly to himself while he tried to

concentrate on his manual.



A little while later, Bruce walked up to the

table where Michael, Eric, and Calvin studied

their manuals.

“It‟s your turn, Michael,” Bruce said while he

sat down at the table and looked beat.

Michael looked nervous while picked up his

flight helmet and stood up.



53

Michael walked out of the hut and saw the

TH-55 chopper with IP Perry waiting outside on

the tarmac. He rushed over to the chopper and

ducked down then he got close to the rotating

blades.



Michael got inside the chopper and looked

nervous with flying. “Mr. Perry,” he said the

second he hooked up his flight helmet to the

intercom.

“Yes, Grayson,” IP Perry said while he

glanced over at Michael.

“I‟m so sorry for yesterday,” Michael said

and looked ashamed.

“Sorry? For what?” IP Perry said and looked

a little baffled by Michael‟s statement.

“For my extremely poor performance. I don‟t

know what went wrong. I‟ve been studying how

to fly helicopters since I was a kid. I know

everything there is to know about them.

Yesterday should have been so easy for me,”

Michael told him.

“Listen. Reading about how helicopters fly

and actually flying them are two different things.

For instance, trying to hover one of these

contraptions is somewhat like trying to balance a

tennis ball on a needle. I sucked when I started.



54

So don‟t worry, it takes time and practice,” IP

Perry said then patted Michael on his shoulder.

“Thanks,” Michael said feeling better and

was still nervous about being eliminated.

“Come on. I‟m going to teach you how to fly

a helicopter,” IP Perry said.



A few minutes later, IP Perry lifted the TH-55

off the tarmac and taxied down the stagefield.

IP Perry hovered the TH-55 about four feet

off the ground.

“Okay, you have the cyclic and anti-pedal

controls,” IP Perry told Michael.

Michael looked nervous while he placed his

boots on the anti-torque pedals, his left hand on

the cyclic control.

The TH-55 chopper moved forward.

Michael moved the cyclic back.

The TH-55 moved backwards.

Michael moved the cyclic forward.

The TH-55 moved to the right.

Michael moved the cyclic to the left.

The TH-55 moved to the left.

“Rest your right arm on your right leg and

use very little movements with the cyclic,” IP

Perry instructed Michael.



55

Michael followed his instruction and rested

his right arm on his right leg.

The TH-55 continued with the forward,

backwards, right and left movements but were

not as drastic as before.

“Don‟t tense up your arm as that wil cause

the helicopter to move around,” IP Perry told

Michael.

Michael relaxed a bit and he started to have

better control of the chopper.



After some more hovering practice and other

maneuvers, IP Perry flew away and headed

back to the Downing heliport.

He leveled off at one thousand feet. “I‟m

going to let you take control of her. See that

distance between the horizon and the tips of the

blades?”

Michael looked straight ahead and saw that

distances. “Yes sir.”

“Good. Now keep that distance with the

cyclic. That will keep the airspeed constant. If

that distance decreases, your airspeed will

increase. If that distance increases, your

airspeed wil decrease. It‟s all about outside

references,” IP Perry added. “Okay, take over

the controls.”



56

Michael places his hands on the cyclic and

collective controls while he places his boots on

the pedals. He concentrated on keeping the tips

of the rotating blades at the same distance

above the horizon. He actually did a great job.

“Now, while you‟re flying, I want you to also

constantly keep your head moving from inside to

the outside. I want you to crosscheck for

airspeed, altitude, rpm and ground track,” IP

Perry said while he pointed with a finger.

“Airspeed, altitude, rpm, and ground track,” IP

Perry repeatedly numerous times to hopefully

get it deep-seated in Michael‟s head.

Airspeed, altitude, rpm and ground track!

Michael repeated to get it burned in his mind

while he performed those functions.

While Michael flew the TH-55, he practiced

turns to the right then turns to the left. He also

practiced making one hundred eight degree

turns to the left and then to the right.

Then he flew the chopper back to Downing

heliport at eighteen hundred feet east area

marker.

He turned the TH-55 and headed to the

outer marker.

“I got the controls,” IP Perry said while he

placed his shoes and hands on the controls.



57

Michael removed his boots and hands off

the controls. He watched while IP Perry started

descending the TH-55 back to the flightline of

the main heliport at Fort Wolters.



A little while later, Michael watched while IP

Perry touched the TH-55 chopper softly on the

flightline.

The engine idled. “We‟ll give her a few

minutes to cool down,” IP Perry told Michael.

They waited.

A few minutes passed. “Shut her down,” IP

Perry told Michael.

Michael grabbed the cockpit card off the

console.

IP Perry watched while Michael performed

the shutdown procedure per the cockpit card.

The engine whined down and the blades

started slowing down.

IP Perry glanced over at Michael. “See.

You were a lot better after the second day. And

I have a gut feeling that it‟ll get easier for you

each day,” he said.

“Thank you sir,” Michael said and felt a little

more confident that he might not get eliminated

in the near future.





58

The weeks passed and Michael started to

get the hang of flying a helicopter.

He mastered hovering and was proud when

he received his “Hoverbug” card from IP Perry.



More weeks had passed and Michael was

taking off, landing, and doing other maneuvers,

including autorotations, with very little assistance

from IP Perry. He felt like a helicopter pilot.



Then one day at the stagefield Ramrod, IP

Perry had Michael land and idle the copter.

“Take her around for three circuits then

come back here and pick me up,” IP Perry said

while he unbuckled his harness then

disconnected his helmet from the intercom.

Michael looked nervous and IP Perry saw it

in his eyes.

“Don‟t worry, I wouldn‟t step out if I didn‟t

feel confident you can do this,” IP Perry said in a

loud voice over the sound of the engine and

blades.

IP Perry rushed away from the chopper and

when he was at a safe location, he gave Michael

a thumbs up sign.

“Michael glanced over at the empty left seat

and he had a sense of scary loneliness.



59

He took a deep breath and glanced back at

IP Perry and wondered if that would be the last

person he would see before he perished.

He revved up the engine and soon lifted the

TH-55 chopper off the flightline

He taxied the TH-55 to the nearest lane.

Michael taxied over to Lane 2 and started

his take-off.

“It‟s now up to me and only me,” Michael

quietly said while realized he as the only one

who could land safely.



A little while later, Michael had completed

his required three circuits and landed back to the

area where IP Perry waited.



IP Perry got back inside the TH-55 and

buckled in his seat and hooked up his helmet to

the intercom.

“Great job,” IP Perry said then patted

Michael on his right shoulder.

Michael gleamed from ear to ear and the

feeling of flying a helicopter alone was the best

feeling in the world.

“I told you it would get easier,” IP Perry said.

“That you did,” Michael replied with his huge

grin.



60

“Let‟s head back to Downing,” IP Perry.

“Yes sir,” Michael replied and soon he had

the engine revved up and the blades were

slicing their way faster through the air.

Michael lifted the TH-55 off the flight line and

taxied to Lane 2.



A little while later, Michael landed the TH-55

back at the Downing heliport. After it cooled

down, Michael worked on the shut-down

procedures.

While they walked back to the hangar,

Michael wore his yellow cap with the brim at the

front. He had a huge grin.



Later that day, Michael and the rest of his

class went on the Army bus to the Holiday Inn

located in the town of Mineral Wells.

This was a local hangout for the candidates

of the helicopter school and where they held

their solo parties.

Eric, Bruce, Calvin, and some other

candidates carried Michael under the two rotor

blades that were impeded into the ground like a

large “A” letter. This was a tradition.



61

Two other groups of candidates carried two

other candidates that also soloed today. They

walked under the rotor blades.

The three groups of candidates the n carried

Michael and the two other candidates to the

swimming pool area.

They tossed Michael and the two other

candidates into the swimming pool.

Michael got out of the pool soaking wet.

The two other candidates also got out of the

pool soaking wet.

“You should feel lucky. We heard that a

couple of years ago, they would throw you in

any water hole or any mud puddle they could

find,” Bruce told Michael while he stood by the

pool creating a puddle.

“Lucky me,” Michael said while he walked

over to a table where there were some cold

beers waited to assist with their celebrations.

The candidates partied for a coupe of hours

drinking beer and laughing at jokes and each

other‟s goofs during their training. Life was good

for the guys. So far.



62





Chapter 6


During the rest of Michael‟s primary flight

training, he learned the techniques of pinnacle,

cross-country trips, confined area, formation

flying, slope operations, the important

autorotations, emergency procedures,

navigation at normal and low level flight at five

hundred feet, and night operations.

He received around over one hundred hours

of flight time with sixty hours of that being solo

time when he graduated from Fort Wolters.

Michael now felt like a helicopter pilot and was

proud of his Certificate of Training from the Army

for completion of his pre-flight training.



It was the end of January 1969, and after a

few days of leave and time with his mom, dad,

and Kevin, it was time for Michael to head back

to the Army.

So Eric drove over to Glendale in his red

1957 Chevy convertible. He picked up Michael.

They headed east for their next assignment,

which was at Fort Rucker near Enterprise,

Alabama.



63



Michael drove his 57 Chevy east on

Interstate 10 in California with the top down.

The radio blared the song Born To Be Wild by

Steppenwolf while they enjoyed the rays on

sunshine beating down on their faces.

“Man. It sure felt good going home to see

my folks and friends for a few days,” Eric said

while he enjoyed the view of California.

“I know. Mom cried again when I left.

That‟s the part I hate,” replied Michael recal ing

that moment.

“I know what you mean,” Eric added then he

looked bothered. “I have a cousin, Ernie that‟s a

junior at Berkley. He‟s got himself involved in

those protests against the Vietnam War. He

also tried to talk me into going AWOL and hiding

out in Canada.”

“I ran into this girl I knew while I was a

senior in high school. She told me how her

older brother was killed over in Vietnam six

months ago. He was a Marine and got

ambushed. Do you think we‟ll be going to

Nam?” Michael asked Eric and looked a little

nervous.

“Probably, since we‟l be flying copters” Eric

replied then he looked a little pissed. “My cousin



64

confessed he burned his draft card and stated

he would rather run to Canada than serve in

Vietnam. I wanted to beat the living crap out of

him,” he added.

Michael looked a little nervous with the

possibility of being sent to Vietnam but knew he

had to go when ordered. There was no turning

back now. “My best friend Kevin got married

while I was in basic. He recently joined the

Army and hopes to fly helicopters,” he added

while he thought about all those nights he and

Kevin watched the Whirlybirds TV show.

“My girlfriend from high school dumped me

just before I went into the Army. She‟s also one

of these anti-war hippie chicks and didn‟t want to

be with a guy that kills for a living. So she told

me,” Eric said and still looked hurt.

“I never had a girlfriend in high school. I

wanted one. But they didn‟t want me for some

reason,” Michael responded while he looked at

the passing countryside.

Eric started thinking about girls and his eyes

lit up with an idea. “I know what we can do,” he

said to Michael with a sparkle in his eyes.

“What‟s that?”

“We‟l make a little pit stop in Louisiana. A

good buddy from high school is playing football



65

for LSU. He can hook us up with some of that

Cajun pootang,” Eric offered with a horny grin.

Michael thought about Eric‟s offer and

replied with a huge grin grew indicating he was

in agreement with losing his virginity.



A few hours later, Eric pulled off I-10 and

found a gas station.

He pulled in filled up the tank with gas.



After they left the gas station, they found a

hamburger joint and ate a quick dinner.

Eric put the convertible top up and they hit

the Interstate and headed east with the setting

sun behind their back. This time, Michael drove

so Eric could catch some shut eye in the

backseat.



Then later that night, Eric drove through

Arizona while Michael got some shut eye in the

backseat.



Eric and Michael took turns driving during

the next couple of days and arrived in Baton

Rouge, Louisiana on a Wednesday afternoon.

They grabbed a room at a Holiday Inn and

took a nap.



66



Later that evening, Eric called his buddy

Kent Williams at his dorm. They made plans to

meet at 9:00 that night at the local college

hangout. The place was called The Tigers Den

and was located just outside the Louisiana State

University campus.



Eric and Michael headed out to The Tigers

Den bar to meet Kent.



Eric and Michael walked into The Tigers

Den bar where the song Jumpin’ Jack Flash by the Rolling Stones blared from the jukebox.

Eric and Michael looked around the bar and

saw college girls and guys wearing bell-bottom

blue jeans and tee shirts. Eric and Mic hael were

the only guys in the bar with short hair and they

stood out like a sore thumb.

“I‟m liking this place so far,” Eric said while

he leaned over to Michael.

Michael smiled at the sight of all the college

chicks.

“Eric!” Kent Wil iams called out from a table

near the center of the bar.



67

Michael and Eric looked at the direction of

Kent‟s voice and saw him sitting at the table with

three sexy college women.

“Let‟s go get some Cajun pootang,” Eric told

Michael with a grin.

The two walked over to Kent‟s table.

Kent and Eric immediately shook hands.

“It‟s so good to see you again,” Kent said

while he looked Eric over. “I see the Army is

taking good care of you,” he added.

“I see you bulked up a bit since high school,”

Eric said while he looked Kent over.

“Yeah and of course the ladies love it,” Kent

said while he winked at his girlfriend Mindy a

blonde hair brown eyed tanned beauty from

Florida.

“This is Michael Grayson. We both went

through the same pre-flight training class in

Texas,” Eric told Kent.

Kent and Michael shook hands.

Michael and Eric looked at the two other

ladies sitting at the table that started checking

them out.

Kent noticed the guys looking at the other

ladies. “Eric and Michael, meet Paula and

Christina,” he said then placed a hand on

Mindy‟s shoulder. “And this beauty is Mindy and



68

she‟s all mine,” Kent added while he glanced

down at Mindy who smiled up at him.

Eric and Michael smiled at Paula and

Christina who smiled back.

“Wel , guys, take your pick. I know you

won‟t be disappointed,” Kent said with a smirk.

Eric sat down by Paula who was drop dead

gorgeous brunette from Little Rock, Arkansas

who had a southern twang in her voice.

Michael sat down next to Christina a dark

haired blue eyes beauty from Jackson,

Mississippi who also had a southern twang in

her voice.

The Magic Carpet Ride song on the jukebox

stopped playing. The song Sunshine Of Your

Love by Cream started playing.

“These two guys are helicopter pilots for the

Army,” Kent told the ladies.

“We‟re training to be Army helicopter pilots.

We just completed our pre-flight training,” Eric

said while he glanced over at Paula.

“We‟re going to Fort Rucker in Alabama for

some more advanced training,” added Eric.

“Are you guys going to Vietnam?” Paula

asked.

“Probably,” Michael replied.

“Yeah, most copter pilots do,” Eric added.



69

“I don‟t like that war. Kil ing doesn‟t not

make sense,” Paula added and looked sad.

“The brother of my girlfriend in high school

was killed over in Nam. He was also in the

Army,” Mindy said.

“My cousin had his leg blown off over there.

And now he only had one leg,” Christina added

that gave Michael that she wasn‟t one of the

brightest students on campus.

Eric and Michael started to get bummed out

with all this talk about people getting killed or

injured over in Vietnam. Kent noticed.

“Let‟s get some beer and talk about some

happier stuff,” Kent said and motioned for Eric to

go with him to the bar.

“I‟m going to the bathroom,” Mindy said.

“I‟l join you,” Paula added.

Eric and Kent got up from the table and

headed over to the bar.

Mindy and Paula got up and headed to the

bathroom leaving Michael alone with Christina.

“I bet you have to be real y intel igent to fly a

helicopter,” Christina asked Michael.

“I guess so,” Michael replied.

“I think my doctor told me I was intelligent,”

Christina said and looked proud.



70

“I can imagine you have to be intel igent to

go to col ege. What was your IQ score,” Michael

replied.

“My doctor said I had twenty-twenty vision,”

Christina replied and looked dead serious.

Michael looked at Christina unsure he heard

correctly. “Did you say twenty-twenty?”

Christina nodded in agreement.

“And you‟re a student at LSU?” Michael

asked.

“Oh no, I work in the administration office,”

Christina replied.

Michael checked out Christina‟s “Keep On

Truckin” tee shirt and saw her nipples from her

C-cup tits poking through the material. He

smiled at her and knew tonight would finally be

his night. After all, she was probably easy and

gullible.



A little while later, Eric and Kent returned

with two pitchers of Budweiser beer and six

glass mugs.

Mindy and Paula walked back to the table

from the restrooms looking refreshed with

lipstick.

Kent poured beer into the six mugs. He

grabbed one of the mugs and held it up. “To



71

Eric and Michael. If they go to Nam, I hope they

come back home in one piece,” Kent cal ed out.

Eric, Michael, Mindy, Paula, and Christina

each grabbed a mug of beer. They raised their

glasses and clinked them together.

The Sunshine Of Your Love song stopped

playing on the jukebox. The Hurdy Gurdy Man

song by Donovan started playing on the

jukebox.

Thirty minutes had passed and the first

pitcher of beer was just foam at the bottom of

the glass, they started drinking the second

pitcher.

The Hurdy Gurdy Man song ended and then

the I Heard It Through the Grapevine by Marvin

Gaye started playing on the jukebox. Everybody

at the table was a little drunk and started singing

along with Marvin.

An hour later and the second pitcher of beer

were empty and they were on their third pitche r

and really felt the alcohol.

The song Mony Mony by Tommy James and

the Shondells started playing on the jukebox.

Christina, Paula, and Mindy started singing

along with Tommy James.



72

After the Mony Mony song ended, Michael

leaned over to Christina. “Let‟s have a private

party in my room,” he whispered in her ear.

“Okay,” Christina quickly replied, which took

Michael by surprise.

Michael and Christina got up from the table

and headed out the door holding hands.

Eric looked proud of Michael while he watch

them leave the bar. The looked at Paula and

smiled. She smiled back and knew exactly what

he wanted.



Outside The Tigers Den, Michael suddenly

felt a little stupid. “I don‟t have a car to take us

back to my hotel,” Michael told Christina.

“I can drive,” Christina said while she

grabbed Michael‟s hand and they headed to the

parking lot.

Christina walked Michael to her white 1961

Volkswagen Beetle.

They got inside the Beetle and Christina

drove out of the parking lot.



A little while later, Michael had Christina in

his hotel room at the Holiday Inn.

They started kissing and it was not long

before they both stripped out of their clothes.



73

Michael couldn‟t believe his eyes when he

saw Christina‟s naked flesh. He stared at her

perky C-cup tits and then her triangle of black

bush at her crotch that looked like it was pointed

to the area of pleasure. This was the first time

he saw a live naked woman. Playboy

magazines from Kevin‟s dad‟s garage do not

count. So the sight of her naked flesh gave him

a boner in seconds.

They jumped on his bed and started kissing.

Michael rolled on top of Christina and she

guided him inside of her. Michael started

pumping Christina. She moaned. He grunted.

It was over in two minutes. Michael finally lost

his virginity.

Christina and Michael lay in bed.

She lit up a cigarette and started smoking.

She rested her head on his chest.



An hour later, Michael got horny again. He

started kissing Christina went for round two. He

got another boner. He climbed on top of her and

went inside of her like he was a pro. He huffed

and puffed and she moaned for another four

minutes. He was done five minutes later. They

col apsed into each other‟s arms.



74

Ten o‟clock rolled around and Christina got

up out of bed.

Michael watched her ass cheeks while she

walked naked to the bathroom.

He wondered if she would go for round three

after she returned.

Christina walked out of the bathroom and

walked over to her purse on the small dresser.

“I know of a place on campus were we can

go have some great fun. There‟s going to be a

party there in a little while with some other

friends from the campus,” Christina said while

she opened up her purse and removed a joint.

Michael got a little nervous at the sight of

that illegal item, “Ah, no thanks. I real y need to

get some sleep for our journey to our next base,”

he said and just wanted her to leave.

“That‟s too bad, as it‟s going to be a groovy

party,” Christina said while she reached down on

the floor and grabbed her panties.

Michael watched while she slipped on her

panties then slipped on her bell-bottom pants.

While she slipped on her “Keep On Truckin”

tee shirt and was scared the Baton Rouge police

would pound on the door any second to bust

them for drugs.





75

Christina left Michael‟s hotel room and he

was relieved.

A little while later, Michael fell fast asleep

with a grin that he has sex twice tonight. He

was the man!



Six o‟clock in the morning came quick and

Michael woke up, shaved and took a shower.

He packed his suitcase and left his room.

He walked down to Eric‟s room and knocked

on the door.

After a few seconds, Eric‟s hotel room door

cracked opened and he poked his head outside.

He looked groggy. “Yeah,” Eric said and

yawned big.

“Come on Eric. We need to rol ,” Michael

told him.

“Aw come on. Just one more hour. Please,”

Eric replied and cracked the door open a little

more so Michael can peek inside his room.

Michael saw Paula naked in Eric‟s bed. The

sight of her started to give him another boner.

He tried to think about helicopters so he would

not embarrass himself by having a pump tent in

his pants.



76

“We need to make it to Fort Rucker before

four,” Michael replied and hated to disrupt Eric‟s

opportunity for some more sex.

“Shit,” Eric said but knew Michael was right.

“I‟l meet you at the International House of

Pancake. I need some coffee and breakfast

before we hit the road,” Michael said.

“Okay. Give me a few,” Eric replied then

closed his hotel room.

Michael walked away with his suitcase.



77





Chapter 7


Eric and Michael made the road trip from

Baton Rouge to Dothan, Alabama without a

hitch and on time.



A little while later, Eric drove his 57 Chevy

through the main gate at Fort Rucker and they

were dressed in their khaki uniforms

While they drove through the base, the

sweet sound of Huey helicopters filled the air.

Eric and Michael looked around the sky and

saw some Huey‟s flying descending to Fort

Rucker. They both started salivating at the

thought of being Huey pilots one day.



After they signed in and were assigned

rooms in the barracks, Michael and Eric walked

around Fort Rucker to get a feel for their new

home for the next eight weeks.



The next morning arrived and Michael and

Eric sat in a briefing room with some other

candidates that arrived to start their additional

flight training.



78

Captain Charlie Foley stood at the front of

the class. Captain Foley had been with the

Army for twelve years and just returned from

Vietnam eight months ago.

“Good morning candidates. Welcome to

Fort Rucker for the rest of your aviation training.

Your training here will consist of four weeks of

instrument training and then you‟l have four

weeks of tactical training for preparation for

Vietnam,” Captain Foley told the room.



Michael raised his hand.

“Stand up. State your name and question,”

Captain Foley said the second he saw Michael‟s

hand in the air.

Michael stood up. “Candidate Michael

Grayson. When do we get to fly the Huey?” he

asked with sparkles in his eyes.

“That‟s a frequent question asked by al

candidates. First you will fly a modified Bell OH

thirteen T for your initial instrument training. You

will learn to trust your instruments over what

your body is tel ing you,” Captain Foley told the

room.

“Aw shit,” Michael said under his breath.

“Then you will transition to the Huey for

some more instrument and tactical training,”

Captain Hopkins replied.



79

“Thank you sir,” Michael said with a huge

grin while he sat back down.

“When you complete your instrument

training. The Army will not issue you a standard

instrument ticket like what the FAA issues. The

Army will issue you a pink Tactical Instrument

Card,” Captain Foley told the room.

Michael leaned over to Eric. “Man. I‟ve

always wanted to fly that big bubble bird, but I

real y want my hands on a Huey,” he whispered

in Eric‟s ear when he knew Captain Foley could

not see him.

“In due time my friend. In due time,” Eric

whispered back.

Michael sat there and dreamt about what it

would be like to fly the Bell Huey.



The next day arrived, and Michael and the

other candidates started with their instrument

training.

Michael walked out to the flight line with IP

Roy Dean with an instrument hood in his one

hand and his flight helmet in his other hand.

IP Dean was also a retired Army Major with

Vietnam experience. IP Dean had been

instructing as a civilian instructor at Fort Rucker

for the past two years.



80

While Michael and IP Dean walked out to

their OH-13T chopper, four Hueys were heard

flying over the flightline.

Michael glanced up at the sky and saw the

Hueys and started drooling. “Man, what a

beautiful sight.”

“What‟s a beautiful sight?”

“Those Huey‟s. That‟s one beautiful

machine,” Michael said while he pointed up at

the four whirlybirds up in the sky.

IP Dean glanced up at the Hueys. “Al you

new pilots want the Huey. But first we need

work on your instrument training first,” IP Dean

said while he got in the right seat of the OH-13T

chopper.



Michael got inside and sat in the left seat of

the OH-13T chopper and remembered those

days of watching the Whirlybird TV show. He

was excited about flying the Bell 47 helicopter,

but his true love was now the Huey.

“Let‟s get her airborne,” IP Dean instructed

Michael.

“Yes sir,” Michael said then reached down

and removed the cockpit card from its sleeve by

the side of the console.



81

He went through the startup procedure and

had the blades of the TH-13T spinning in no

time.

Michael then installed his hood on his flight

helmet that restricted his field of vision. He

swiveled the shield on the right side of the

console out so it would restrict his view out of

the bubble.



A little while later, Michael lifted the TH-13T

chopper off the flightline while watching the

instrument console.

Michael taxied the chopper down the

flightline and soon started his ascent into the

Alabama sky.



Michael had the chopper flying at eighteen

hundred feet above the ground.

“Keep her at eighteen hundred and on a

heading of zero eight zero,” IP Dean said.

Michael flew the TH-13T by keeping his

eyes on the instruments and the hood prevented

him from seeing outside the bubble. He did a

great job.





82

During the next four weeks, Michael

completed his instrument training in the OH-13T

chopper.

Twenty-five hours were also spent in the

Link Trainer for instrument training. This was a

trainer designed around 1929, and it looked like

a small airplane that was a kid‟s ride at a

carnival. The Link Trainer had roll, yaw and

ascent and descent capability and the

instruments reacted accordingly to the

movement of the controls.

Michael also learned to fly under the hood

from point to point by way of the Automatic

Direction Finder.

He then learned to fly a Ground Controlled

Approach by and land the TH-13T by following

instructions by a soldier on the ground.



It was now early March of 1969 and Michael

got off the bus with IP Jack Stone on the

flightline by a Huey. IP Stone was also a retired

Army helicopter pilot who also had a tour in

Vietnam flying a Huey.



Michael was in heaven while he climbed

inside the Huey and sat in the right seat and

buckled his harness. He looked at all the



83

gauges, switches and knobs and knew this was

definitely a more advanced chopper than the

Bell TH-13T and Hughes TH-55 choppers.

“I think I‟ve died and gone to heaven,”

Michael said while IP Stone climbed and sat

down in the left seat.

“Why do you say that?” IP Stone asked

while he buckled his harness.

“I‟m going to learn how to fly a Huey,”

Michael replied while he placed his flight helmet

on his head.

IP Stone chuckled, as he heard that type of

comment a thousand times in the past two

years.



A little while later, IP Stone talked through

the start-up procedure and soon had the skids of

the Huey off the flightline.

He ascended the Huey and Michael listened

to his every instruction.



After IP Stone leveled the Huey off at two

thousand feet, he let Michael take over the

controls.

Michael flew around the countryside of lower

Alabama for his orientation flight of the Huey.





84

An hour later, Michael landed the Huey back

on the flightline with the guidance of IP Stone.



After he shut the engine down and was

debriefed by IP Stone, Michael strutted back to

the barracks with a huge grin.

“Hey. How was your flight?” Eric asked the

second he saw Michael enter the barracks.

“Mine was great. How was your flight?”

Michael replied.

“Man. I think I had a raging hard-on during

the whole flight. Yep. One day I‟m gonna marry

me a Huey. Maybe have lots of little baby

Huey‟s hovering around,” Eric responded.

“Man. I‟m now starting to worry about you,”

Michael said while he pretended to look worried

about his buddy.

They both chuckled.

“Let‟s go get some chow,” Eric said.

Michael nodded in agreement and they

headed to the door of the barracks.



The next four weeks were extremely busy

for Michael while he transitioned into the Huey

and learned tactical flying for Vietnam.

Michael practiced numerous landings with

and without power.



85

Michael learned pinnacles and confined

space maneuvers, how to pick up a load and

other emergency procedures.

He also had classroom training on the basic

operational systems of the helicopter.

Michael would fly the Huey at nighttime over

the dark Alabama countryside for some

instrument training.

He flew at low-level high-speed approaches

in a Huey gunship and shot at targets on the

ground.



Near the end of their training, Michael spent

eight days out in the field for some more

training. This included flying a Huey with cans

filled with sand to simulate a full load of soldiers.

He also went through the Eagle Flight where

they were woken up by an alarm, got briefed

and airborne within six minutes. All the Hueys

flew in formation on the way back to Fort

Rucker.

Michael‟s final check ride was a four-hour

ride in a Huey from Fort Rucker down to

Gainesville, Florida where he was required to

perform four approaches.





86

Then that long awaited day arrived to

graduate from their advanced flight training at

Fort Rucker. It had been a long haul from the

day the candidates first drove through the gates

at Fort Wolters to the graduation ceremony that

will happen today. Today was the day these

candidates will become Warrant Officers and get

their wings to indicate they are now official Army

helicopter pilots.

The viewing stands on the flight line was

packed with fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters,

and wives of the candidates. They loved the

sight of all the candidates while they flew Hueys

in formation over the flightline. It was a beautiful

music of hundreds of flying Hueys.

Then all the candidates received their

certificates and wings indicating they were now

officially Army helicopter pilots.

After the ceremony, Michael and Eric

hugged each other to celebrate their completion

of this grueling training. They both had Warrant

Officer WO1 bars on their uniforms and looked

so proud.

“We made it. I can‟t believe we made it,”

Michael told Eric.

“Yeah. There were times I had my doubts.

But we survived Mother Rucker,” Eric replied.



87

Michael looked at the shiny wings in his

hand. “Give me your wings,” he told Eric.

“What?” Eric replied and couldn‟t understand

why Michael wanted his wings.

“It‟s a tradition. Give me your wings and I‟l

give you mine,” Michael replied.

“That doesn‟t make any sense,” Eric

responded and thought Michael flipped his lid.

“It‟s suppose to be bad luck to wear the

wings given to you at graduation. I‟ll wear yours

and you‟ll wear mine,” Michael said while he

held out his wings to Eric.

“What the hell,” Eric said while he snatched

up Michael‟s wings and handed his wings to

him.

Michael and Eric swapped wings and pinned

them on their uniform.

Harry and Elaine Grayson walked up to

Michael and Eric. They looked so proud of

Michael‟s accomplishment.

Congratulations my boy,” Harry said while

he extended out his hand.

“Thanks dad,” Michael said while he shook

his father‟s hand.

Elaine gave Michael a hug and kiss on his

cheek.



88

“Mom, dad, remember my good friend Eric

Wilson. He endured the flight training at Fort

Wolters and at Fort Rucker with me,” Michael

said while he placed a hand on Eric‟s shoulder.

“Ah yeah, I remember him picking you up for

the trip here,” Harry said.

Elaine nodded and smiled that she

remembered Eric.

“It‟s a pleasure to see you again Mister and

Misses Grayson,” Eric said while he shook

Harry‟s hand.

“I want a picture,” Elaine said then reached

inside her purse and removed a Kodak

Instamatic camera.

Michael and Eric stood side by side with

huge grins.

Elaine snapped a picture.

Off in the distance, Eric‟s mother and father

saw him and started waving to catch his

attention.

“Please excuse me. My parents are over

there,” Eric said the second he saw them. He

waved at them to join him over with Michael and

his parents.

“So. Do you know where your first

assignment will be?” Harry asked Michael.



89

“Vietnam,” Michael replied and did not

appear nervous about his assignment.

“I‟m stationed at Fort Benning in Georgia,”

Eric added.

Harry placed his hand on Michael‟s

shoulder. “Now. Don‟t you go fal ing out of a

helicopter and breaking an arm,” Harry said in a

jokingly manner.

“What‟s that about?” Eric curiously asked.

“Kid stuff,” Michael replied.

Elaine‟s eyes started to water up and her

lips started to quiver at the thought of her son

going to combat. She placed the Kodak camera

back in her purse and fought from balling.

Eric‟s parents walked over and after some

introductions, they decided to head out to the

nearby town of Enterprise. They had a nice

dinner.



The next day, Michael and Eric drove in

Eric‟s 57 Chevy back to California for some

leave before Michael got shipped out to

Vietnam.



90





Chapter 8


Michael relaxed at home for two weeks.

Most of the guys he hung out with during high

school were either in the military, working full-

time jobs, or in college.

Eric was too busy partying with his friends to

hang out with Michael.

His best friend Kevin was now in the Army

and his wife divorced him two months after they

got married. She apparently wanted nothing to

do with being a military wife. So she divorced

Kevin and soon married another guy. He was a

couple of years older and worked at Warner

Brothers studio as a security guard.

Michael did not have his best friend to hang

out with. When Harry and Elaine visited Fort

Rucker, they informed him that Kevin shipped

out to Munich, Germany three weeks ago.

Michael was bored out of his mind, as home was

no longer the same. He got Kevin‟s address in

Munich from Kevin‟s mom and decided to write

him before left for Vietnam.

After his leave was over, Michael went to

McCord Air Force Base. Leaving home was



91

hard for Michael. But he knew that life there

would be different and actually thought Vietnam

would bring a little adventure. So when Harry

and Elaine took him to the bus station where he

watched Elaine cry. Without thinking, he

promised her that he would return home alive. It

was a knee jerk reaction, as he just wanted her

tears to stop flowing. But this was a promise he

really did not have any control over. But she

knew that, as did Harry.



At McCord AFB in Washington, Michael

boarded a Seaboard Airlines stretched DC-8 jet

with two hundred and seventy other soldiers all

bound for Vietnam. A few of these soldiers were

actually on their second tour of that war. The

DC-8 took off the runway of McCord AFB and

headed to Vietnam.

The flight of that DC-8 had short refueling

stops in Anchorage, Alaska, Japan, Okinawa

and finally landed in Cam Rahn Air Base, South

Vietnam twenty-three hours later.



It was the end of April and it was a sunny

day with the hot temperature around eighty-eight

degrees Fahrenheit.



92

Michael rode on the Army bus to the

administration building to get processed into this

country.

After Michael left the administration building,

he got a room in the temporary barracks. He

was in a wait mode until he was taken to his

assigned unit.

While he waited, Michael spent time relaxing

at the beach at Cam Rahn Bay. He even

borrowed a surfboard from one of the soldiers

and went surfing. He thought Vietnam was

pretty cool duty so far, as it reminded him so

much of California with the beach parties and

lots of beer drinking.



Then the next day arrived and all this fun in

the Vietnam sun would all change. A Huey flew

over to Cam Rahn Bay Air Base to give Michael

the ride to his unit.

Michael sat in the Flight Operations building

at the air base along with Warrant Officers One

Pete Oliver, Frank McFadden, and Albert

Biannotti. As Michael learned from chatting with

them, they were all at Fort Rucker during the

same time, but were in different classes.



93

“I need Biannotti, Grayson, Frank, and

Oliver,” a voice bel owed out while Michael

started to nod off in his chair.

He opened up his eyes and saw 1st

Lieutenant (1LT) Billy Burrows standing at the

door in a flight suit.

“I‟m Grayson,” he said while he stood up.

“McFadden here,” he said while he stood up.

“You got Biannotti,” he said while he stood

up.

“And Oliver here,” he said while he stood up.

“I‟m Lieutenant Billy Burrows. Follow me

and we‟l get you to your new home away from

home,” he said then turned around and walked

out of the room.

Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert picked up

their duffel bags and walked out of the room.



Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert walked out

of the flight operations building and followed Billy

over to a Huey parked on the tarmac.

While Michael down along the tail rotor

blade of the Huey, he saw a couple of bullet

holes in the tail section and knew this place had

certain people that hated Americans with a

passion.



94

Frank, Pete, and Albert noticed the bullet

holes and they looked a little concerned.

“Guys, meet Grayson, Frank, Pete, and

Albert our new replacement pilots,” Billy told

SGT Chuck Murphy his Crew Chief, and WO2

Jesse Cooper his X-Ray or copilot.

“That‟s Chuck Murphy and Jesse Cooper,”

Billy said completing the introductions.

Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert tossed their

duffel bags in the cargo area of the Huey. They

climbed after their bags and sat down in the

canvas seat and buckled in for the ride.

Chuck got behind the machine gun while

Jesse got in the cockpit along with Billy.



Ten minutes later and Billy had the blades of

the Huey slicing their way through the air. He

soon received permission from the control tower

and he lifted the Huey off the tarmac.

He ascended the Huey off into the Vietnam

sky giving Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert had

a bird‟s eye view of the beach area of Cam

Rahn Bay. They thought Vietnam was a cool

place so far especially when they saw all the

people having a blast on the beach.

Billy banked the Huey and headed in a

southwesterly direction.



95



A little while later, Billy flew the Huey at two

thousand feet above the Vietnam countryside.

It looks peaceful. Michael thought to himself

while he glanced out at the quiet countryside.

He saw hilly areas, rivers and tons of jungle. It

was hard to imagine there was a war going on

down there.



Twenty minutes later, Billy flew the Huey

about thirty miles southwest of Cam Rahn Air

Base. They were about twelve miles north of

Tan Son.

“We‟l be landing at your new home soon.

It‟s called Landing Zone Lola,” Billy yelled out at

guys.

“It‟s the home of the Cong Crushers,” Chuck

yelled out while he looked the area over and had

his machine ready for the sight of any VC

sneaking up on the LZ.

Billy made his radio call to the LZ that he

was inbounds for a landing.

Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert glanced out

the opened cargo door area and saw Landing

Zone (LZ) Lola. The place did not look like a

home away from home.



96

Billy started the Huey‟s descent to LZ Lola

after receiving permission to land.

From the air, Michael, Frank, Pete, and

Albert glanced down at LZ Lola. They saw

concertina and razor wire and underground

bunkers with machine guns around the

perimeter of the LZ.

They saw numerous rows of Army green

canvas tents with sandbag revetments around

them.

They saw landing areas with metal

revetment walls for the Hueys. Some Hueys

were parked there and they saw some bare

spots meaning some were out on a mission.

They saw ten soldiers playing football in a

dirt area.

They saw six soldiers milling around he LZ.

They saw four soldiers relaxing lounge

chairs catching some sunrays.

Billy landed the Huey in one of the opened

landing spots behind the metal revetment wall.



After Billy shut the Huey down and the

blades slowed, Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert

grabbed their duffel bags and climbed out of the

chopper.



97

While they followed Billy, Chuck, and Jesse

out of the helicopter landing area, two other

Hueys started up their engines.

Two squads of Cong Crushers walked up to

those Hueys.

The Cong Crushers were ready for action

with their M-16s and Rucksacks on their backs.

These sacks contained items like canteens of

water, gas mask, food rations, grenades,

machete, poncho liner, ammo, and other

personal items.



Michael and the other new guys followed

Billy while they walked past a sign that had

“Welcome to LZ Lola. Home of the Cong

Crushers” written on it. The sign had a cartoon

of a monstrous Army soldier in sleeveless

fatigues with bulging muscles holding an M-16 in

one hand. With his right boot, he stomped on a

Vietcong (VC). We see the VC‟s head sticking

out from under the soldier‟s boot with his eyes

bugging out.

Michael looked back and saw that cartoon

from the sign was the nose art o n all the Hueys

parked in the landing area. But each Huey had

a different number on the fatigue shirt of the



98

muscular soldier. The chopper that picked him

up at Cam Rahn Bay was Crusher 6.

Cool! He thought to himself while he

continued to follow Billy, Chuck and Jesse into

the tent area.

“Who paints the art work?” Michael asked

Billy.

“Corporal Marty Abbott,” Billy replied.

Then the strong stench of a sewer smell hit

their senses like a brick wall.

“What the hell is that smell?” Michael asked

while he pinched off his nose.

“Fucking stinks,” Albert added.

Pete and Frank nodded in agreement

looking like they wanted to get sick any second.

“We burn the shit from the latrines,” Chuck

replied while he pointed in the direction of the

stench.

Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert looked

where Billy pointed and saw four privates

standing by three small metal barrels that were

on fire.

“Welcome to Nam,” Billy said while he got a

chuckle at the guys who could not believe they

burn shit here.



99

Billy, Chuck and Jesse walked Michael,

Frank, Pete, and Albert down a dirt path

between numerous tents.

They noticed that all the tents had sand

bags stacked three-four feet high all around the

perimeter of the tent. Each tent also had a wood

floor installed and most of them were made out

of wood from ammo boxes.

They soon stopped at the opening of the

large Operations tent used for briefings and

other meetings.

Billy took Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert

into the Operations tent while Chuck, and Jesse

walked away.



Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert stepped

inside the tent and saw twelve helicopter pilots

sitting in folding chairs in their flight suits. They

all faced a table.

Sitting behind at table was Lieutenant

Colonel (LTC) Rodney Harrington, a sixteen-

year career man with the Army. LTC Harrington

was the Commander of LZ Lola. He sat there

puffing on a cigar.

Sitting to Harrington‟s right was Master

Sergeant (MSG) James Porter, a middle aged

brute with a crew cut and had been in the Army



100

for twenty-three years. MSG Porter had a

Camel cigarette that dangled from his mouth.

He was a chain smoker and started when he

was a teenager. He insisted that you called him

“Sarge.”

The chopper Huey pilots were bullshitting

with each other while Billy walked Michael,

Frank, Pete, and Albert up to the table.

“Here‟s your FNGs,” Billy told Harrington

while the four guys dropped their duffel bags to

the floor.

Harrington banged on the table a couple of

times with his fist to bring the tent to order. He

took the cigar out of his mouth. “Gentlemen.

May I have your attention?”

The tent got quiet while all eyes were on

Michael and the other three guys.

“I would like to introduce our new FNGs,”

Harrington addressed everybody in the tent.

Michael looked a little confused with the

FNG acronym.

“Okay you FNGs, I‟m Colonel Harrington

and this is Master Sergeant Porter otherwise

known as Sarge.” Welcome to LZ Lola,”

Harrington said then puffed on his cigar. He

looked over at Sarge and nodded.



101

Sarge reached down at a box on the

wooded floor. He removed four black baseball

caps that each had the white “FNG” letters on

the front.

Sarge got up from the table with his

cigarette dangling out of his mouth.

He walked over to Michael, Frank, Pete, and

Albert. He handed them each a baseball cap.

Sarge walked over and sat down at the

table.

Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert looked a

little confused while they glanced down at the

caps they had in their hands.

“I would now like our FNGs to introduce

themselves and tell us where they‟re from,”

Harrington told the four guys.

Michael, Frank, Pete, and Albert looked at

each other to see who would go first.

Pete motioned he would go first. “My name

is Pete Oliver. I‟m from West Chester,

Pennsylvania,” he said while he looked around

the room at everybody.

“It‟s an Amish puke. Where‟s your horse

and buggy? And you better watch out for them

road apples up in the sky,” WO2 Wal y Ross

yelled out.

Some of the other pilots chuckled.



102

“My name is Frank McFadden. I‟m from

Boston Massachusetts,” Frank said while he

looked around the tent at everybody.

“Hey, maybe we can have an old fashion tea

party and eat some beans,” WO3 Butch Paulson

called out.

Some of the other pilots chuckled.

Then one of the pilots shoved his left hand

under his right armpit and made fart sounds.

Michael looked a little nervous. “My name is

Michael Grayson. I‟m from Glendale,

California,” Michael said while he looked around

the room and cringed at the upcoming heckling.

“The only things that come out of California

are queers and steers. Which one are you?”

WO2 Timmy Edison yelled out.

“He can be my peter pilot anytime,” WO2

Chris Moody yelled out and blew some kisses at

Michael.

“Moooo,” yelled out another pilot.

Most of the other pilots chuckled.

Albert really looked nervous with all the

heckling. “My name is Albert Biannotti, and I‟m

from Brooklyn,” he said and didn‟t look around

the tent.

“Hey. You one greasy meatta balla,” 1LT

Doug Daily yelled out.



103

Some of the pilots chuckled.

“As part of your initiation, you must wear

those caps at all times during your first three

days here at LZ Lola. Home of the,” Harrington

said then stopped and looked at the pilots. He

placed his cigar back in his mouth while he

waited for their answer.

“Cong Crushers!” al the pilots yel ed out in

unison and stomped their right boots hard on the

wooden floor. It echoed inside the tent.

Harrington puffed on his cigar with a smile,

as he loved it when his troops did that foot

stomping tradition.

Michael and the other new guys were

suddenly intimidated by their welcoming

committee and were nervous about being in this

unit.

Michael could not stand the curiosity and

had to ask. “Excuse me sir. But what does

FNG mean?”

Harrington looked at the pilots for the

answer.

“Fucking new guy!” all the pilots yelled out in

unison.

Sarge looked down at a clipboard on the

table. “Norton, Oliver wil be your X-ray,” he



104

called out with his Camel still dangling from the

right corner of his mouth.

WO3 Rusty Norton stood up.

Sarge looked back at his clipboard. “Doug,

McFadden will be your X-ray,” he cal ed out.

Doug Daily stood up.

Sarge looked back at this clipboard.

“Rathburn, Grayson wil be your X-ray,” he

called out.



1LT Alan Rathburn stood up.

Sarge looked back at his clipboard.

“Decker, Biannotti will be your X-ray,” he called

out.

WO2 Nathan Decker stood up.





“Okay FNGs. These are your aircraft

commanders. They‟ll take you to your bunks and

get you orientated to Nam. Dismissed,”

Harrington called out then took a puff on his

cigar.

Harrington and Sarge got up from the table

and walked over to the tent opening and left the

tent.

Rusty, Doug, Alan and Nathan walked over

to their applicable FNG.

Alan extended his hand.



105

“It‟s a pleasure to meet you. I‟m Alan

Rathburn. Let‟s go get you a bunk,” he said

while he shook Michael‟s hand.

“Michael Grayson,” he said while he picked

up his duffel bag and walked out of the tent with

Alan.

A few minutes later, Michael and Alan

walked down a dirt path between rows of tents.

“If you don‟t mind me asking, what does

peter pilot mean?” Michael curiously asked Alan.

“Peter pilot is another word for X-ray or

copilot,” Alan replied then stopped at the flaps of

a tent. “Welcome to your new hooch away from

home.”

Michael glanced up and saw “Lola Hilton”

hand painted with white paint on a piece of

scrap wood above the tent flaps.

Alan and Michael went inside the ten-man

tent.

The tent was empty as everybody was out

and about the LZ or on a mission.

Alan walked Michael up to an empty bunk.

“You can sleep here,” he said.

Michael dropped his duffel bag on top of the

canvas bunk.

“There‟s a locker you can store your stuff

inside. You can get a lock out of supply. Make



106

sure you lock it at all times. We‟ve been having

some reports of cash, and other odds and ends

showing up missing. Colonel Harrington will

probably court martial the asshole once he‟s

caught,” Alan said.

“Got it,” Michael replied.

“I‟l show you around the landing zone today.

Tomorrow we‟ll go on a supply run. That‟ll get

you familiar with the area,” Alan said.

Michael followed Alan out of the Lola Hilton.



For the next fifteen minutes, Alan gave

Michael the grand tour of his new home. He

even got Michael a M-16 rifle and some ammo.

Everybody had a M-16 by their bunk in case the

LZ got attacked.



The rest of the evening was boring. So

Michael walked around the LZ a few times and

after awhile, they even got boring.

After he met and chatted with a few of the

soldiers in Lola, he retired back to the Lola

Hilton and lay down on his bunk.

He grabbed a pad of paper and pen from his

locker. He started to write a letter to his parents

and then one to Kevin to let him know he was

now in Vietnam.



107

After Michael sealed up the letters and

dropped the two enveloped off in the mailbag at

the Lola. He then retired back to the Lola Hilton

and got on top of his bunk. A far cry from his

warm bed back home, but was better than

sleeping in the dirt. He started to drift off to

sleep, but then he had the feeling he had to go

to the bathroom. He tried to fight if off but knew

he wouldn‟t win this battle.

He got out of his bunk and headed out of the

tent.



Michael walked through the dark LZ Lola

and found the latrine area. They consisted of

eight wooden outhouses located far away from

the Eloquent Army Cuisine tent, the Party

Palace, and the sleeping tents.

The outhouses were positioned in an area

where the prevailing winds would carry the

stench away from everybody in the LZ. The

entrance had a piece of scrap wood with the

painted “Shitter Way” label. Each outhouse was

also labeled with its own number of “Shitter 1,

Shitter 2, etc,”

He went inside Shitter 3 and sat down on

the first toilet seat over a hole that led to a metal

barrel. He pulled his fatigue pants and boxer



108

shorts down to his ankles. He sat down on the

toilet seat. He almost gagged from the smell of

the buckets full of human waste below his butt

cheeks. It would take him a long while to get

used to this gagging smell.

After Michael was finished with his business,

he headed back to the Lola Hilton.

Michael got back in his bunk.

The night was quiet at LZ Lola and Michael

was soon in a deep sleep.



109





Chapter 9


The sun rose up and most of the guys in the

tent were out on a mission or eating breakfast at

the chow tent called the “Eloquent Army

Cuisine.”

Michael was sound asleep in his bunk.

“Good morning Vietnam!” yel ed the Armed

Forces Radio Network DJ Pat Sajak from one of

the pilot‟s radio at the other end of the tent.

Michael was still sound asleep while the

song Crimson and Clover started playing.

Alan entered the tent in his flight suit and

came back from eating breakfast. He had a cup

of coffee in his right hand and something

wrapped up in a paper towel in his left hand.

He saw Michael was still sound asleep in his

bunk.

Alan walked over to Michael‟s bunk.

He leaned over him. “Wakee wakee fucking

new guy. We‟re going to be late for the war,” he

said while he shook Michael‟s bunk.

Michael opened up his eyes and saw Alan

leaning over his body. For a few seconds he did

not have a clue where he was and then it



110

dawned on him. He sat up on the bunk and

placed his bare feet on the wooden floor.

“I didn‟t realize how the trip over here was

that exhausting,” said Michael then he yawned.

Michael heard a scratching sound coming from

under the wooden floor under his feet. “What‟s

that?”

“Probably a rat,” Alan replied.

“Oh,” Michael replied then he quickly

brought his feet up on his bunk.

Alan got a chuckle out of Michael. “Get

dressed then we can go on a supply run,” Alan

said then he walked over to his bunk.

Michael reached over to his locker and

removed a fresh pair of socks. He slipped them

on then stood up.

Alan waited on his bunk while Michael got

dressed in his flight suit.

Alan got up off his bunk and walked over to

Michael.

“Here‟s some breakfast,” he said while he

handed Michael the cup of coffee and the items

wrapped up in a paper towel.

“Thanks,” Michael said then took a sip of

coffee. The opened up the paper towel and saw

four pieces of toast with butter.



111

Alan walked over to his bunk and grabbed

his flight helmet.

Michael placed his flight helmet over his

head.



Alan and Michael left the Lola Hilton with

Michael gulping down his coffee and shoving

toast into his mouth.

The music of three Huey‟s taking off filled

the air while Alan and Michael walk through L Z

Lola.

Michael looked up at the sky and saw three

Hueys flying away with the combat boots of

some soldier‟s dangling from the cargo area. He

knew they were on their way to be dropped off in

the jungle.

Alan and Michael walked over to a Huey

parked behind a metal revetment. It had its

cargo doors opened on both sides.

Michael saw that his Huey had the number

“5” in yellow on the muscular fatigue shirt of the

Cong Crushers nose art. “I love the nose art of

the Hueys,” Michael told Alan.

“We all slip the LZ cartoonist a few bucks to

paint them. Our Huey is Crusher Five,” Alan

replied.



112

On top of Crusher 5, Michael saw Specialist

Four (SP4) Chuck Calhoun, alias C Squared,

inspecting the rotor system.

“C Squared,” Alan called out while he looked

up at the rotor.

C Squared looked down at Alan and

Michael.

“Meet my new x-ray Michael Grayson,” Alan

called up at C Squared.

“Hey fucking new guy Grayson. I‟m Chuck

Calhoun at your service. I‟m your crew chief.

You can cal me C Squared,” C Squared replied

and bowed gracefully at Michael.

“Is she ready to fly?” Alan asked C Squared.

“She‟s ready to soar,” C Squared said then

started his descent off the top of the Huey.

“Let‟s head out of here,” Alan told

everybody.

Michael gulped down the rest of his coffee.

He crumpled up the paper towel and shoved it in

one of his pockets of his flight suit.

“I‟l stow that for you,” C Squared said and

took the coffee cup out of Michael‟s hand.

“Thanks,” Michael said then walked over

and opened up the left cockpit door and got

inside.



113

Alan walked around the other side and

opened up the right cockpit door and got inside.

C Squared hopped in the cargo area and sat

behind the 50-caliber machine gun at the

starboard side of the chopper.

All three crew members were strapped

inside Crusher 5.

“Okay fucking new guy, start her up and

you‟re going to fly her out of here as part of your

initiation. I‟m going to guide you and enjoy the

scenery,” Alan told Michael then he placed his

helmet on his head.

Michael grabbed the cockpit card and

started running through the start-up procedure.

A few minutes later, Michael had Crusher 5

started and the blades were spinning.

“Lola tower, Crusher Five ready to take-off,”

said Alan into the radio.

“Roger Crusher Five. No inbound aircraft at

this time. Have a safe flight,” Corporal (CPL)

Calvin Webb replied from the radio.

“Let‟s go and make sure you clear that metal

revetment wal ,” Alan told Michael.

Michael nodded in agreement then lifted

Crusher 5 up in the air and ascended missing

the metal revetment.





114

From inside Crusher 5, Michael loved the

view of the Vietnam countryside while the Huey

rose higher in the air.

“Turn to a heading of zero two zero,” Alan

called out.

Michael banked Crusher 5 and turned to that

heading.

“We‟re going to Nha Trang. It‟s about forty

five miles northeast of us. We‟l fly until we pick

up the Song Cai River. Follow that river into

Nha Trang,” Alan told Michael.

“You‟re doing great so far,” Alan said.

Michael felt like a real Army helicopter pilot

now.

“Take her up to twenty-five hundred,” Alan

instructed Michael.

Michael continued to ascend Crusher 5 up

into the sky.



A little while later, Michael leveled Crusher 5

at two thousand feet and continued on his 020

heading.

“Vietnam looks so peaceful, so beautiful,”

Michael said while glanced out the cockpit

windows.



115

“It is until those bastards start shooting at

you,” C Squared said while he scanned the area

for any threatening VC.

Michael started to get a tad nervous when

he heard that comment and looked around the

countryside down below for any signs of VC.



It was a quiet ride and a river was visible up

ahead.

“There‟s the Song Cai River. Follow it

toward the east,” Alan told Michael.

“Got it,” Michael replied.

A few minutes later, Michael banked

Crusher 5 when he got to the Song Cai River

and headed in an easterly direction.



A little while later, Alan pointed at the one

o‟clock position. “There‟s Nha Trang,” he said.

Michael looked in the direction Alan pointed

and saw Nha Trang way off in the distant.

Michael turned Crusher 5 a little to the right

and Nha Trang was straight ahead.

Michael started a slow descent to the

Vietnamese city.

A little while later, Michael followed the Song

Cai River into the outskirts of Nha Trang.



116

While Crusher 5 descended to one thousand

feet, Michael looked out his door window. He

spotted three young boys skinny-dipping in the

muddy waters of the Song Cai River. “Look.

There‟s some boys are skinny dipping down in

that muddy water,” he said.

“That‟s the way some of them take a bath,”

Alan replied.

“That‟s the Vietnamese,” C Squared added

with a chuckle.

“Man, I bet those fish taste like bath water,”

Michael said and cringed at the thought of eating

fish out of that river.

Michael looked ahead and saw a big white

Buddha that sat on a hilltop overlooking Nha

Trang.

“Look at that big white statue of some fat

guy sitting down,” he said.

“It‟s a Buddha,” Alan said.

“Oh,” Michael replied as he never seen a

picture of a Buddha before.

C Squared watched while Crusher 5 flew

past the big statue. “Man. That‟s one huge

Buddha belly.”

“Turn to a southern heading,” Alan told

Michael.



117

Michael banked Crusher 5 to the right and

headed south.

Michael glanced out his door window and

saw the beach and the beautiful South China

Sea. “What a beautiful beach. I would love to

build a resort here. I could make a killing,” he

said.

“The air base is up ahead,” Alan said.

Michael looked straight ahead and saw Nha

Trang Air Base.

After Alan established radio contact with the

air base and received permission to land,

Michael started a slow descent.



Ten minutes later, Michael had Crusher 5

landed on the tarmac and shut down the engine.

Michael, Alan and C Squared got out of

Crusher 5 and headed to the flight operations

building.



Fifteen minutes later, Alan, Michael and C

Squared walked out of the flight operations

building.

A Jeep with an Air Force Airman First Class

driving pulled up and stopped.

Alan, Michael, and C Squared got inside the

Jeep.



118

The Airman First Class drove the Jeep

away.

A little while later, the Airman First Class

pulled the Jeep into the Motor Pool.

A little while later, Alan, drove a Jeep Kaiser

M715 pickup truck out of the Motor Pool with

Michael in the passenger seat and C Squared in

the rear seat.

“Since we have plenty of time, let‟s hit the

beach for few minutes,” Alan said while he drove

the beach toward the main gate of the Air Base.

“Now you‟re talking,” C Squared said while

he kicked back in the rear seat.



Alan drove the Jeep Kaiser through the

streets of Nha Trang. Michael saw tons o f Army

and Air Force personnel in uniform around the

town of Nha Trang having a grand old time.

These sights did not look like a war was in

progress. It looked like numerous soldiers

drinking and trying to get the pants off the

Vietnamese chicks.



Ten minutes later, Michael, Alan, and C

Squared walked down the beach. They glanced

at some of the Vietnamese girls soaking up the

sun.



119

Then Michael saw a familiar face sitting

alone in the sand. He had to do a double take

but it was him and he could not belie ve his eyes.

Sitting on the beach in a bathing suit on a towel

was old SSG Vinny Moore from Fort Wolters,

Texas. Michael noticed that his fatigues were

crumpled up in a pile. They were no longer the

starched uniform with razor thin creases he wore

in Texas. His once spit polished combat boots

were now dull and scuffed up. Michael also

noticed the tattoos that filled both of Vinny‟s

forearms and a naked lady on the shin of his left

leg. Vinny puffed on a cigar while he stared at

the waves through his Ray-ban sunglasses.

Vinny did not recognize Michael, as he seen so

many candidates go through Fort Wolters, that

they all started to look alike. Something

bothered Vinny while he sipped on his can of

Budweiser. Four empty Budweisers were

dumped in the sand by Vinny.

Michael just walked away with Alan and C

Squared down a little way down the beach.

They found a spot and made camp in the sand.

They started soaking up the sun and checking

out the South China Sea.



120

A little ways down the beach, two Army guys

wearing flight suits were visible standing near

the edge of the water looking out at the water.

Then two Vietnamese girls of proper age

walked down the beach near Michael, Alan and

C Squared while they sat in the sand.

One of the girls glanced at Michael and gave

him a warm smile while she checked him out.

“Wel hello ladies,” Michael said to the two

young ladies and patted the sand next to him.

“You join me?” he added with a warm smile.

The girls giggled and continued to walk

away down the beach.

“Ah man, I got rejected by those two

beautiful Vietnamese ladies,” Michael said while

he watched the ladies walk away.

“Watch out, they can be extremely deadly,”

Alan said in a serious tone while he watched the

two ladies walk down the beach.

“With deadly sexy moves in bed I hope,”

Michael said as he found the Vietnamese

women extremely sexy.

“It could happen in there too,” C Squared

said in a serous tone.

Michael did not have a clue about the

warnings Alan and C Squared just gave him so

he shrugged it off.



121

“Hey Alan,” the voice of 1LT Lieutenant

Sonny Valens called out from down the beach.

Alan looked and saw his buddy Sonny and

WO2 Jeff Barker walking up to him in fatigue

pants and both were bare chested.

“Hey Sonny,” Alan cal ed out while he stood

up.

“How have you been?” Sonny said while he

shook Alan‟s hand. “What you doing over

here?” he asked.

“Supply run. What‟s going on with you?”

Alan asked.

“We‟re getting ready to do some target

practice,” Sonny replied then gave Alan a grin.

Michael curiously looked around the beach.

“Target practice? Where?”

Sonny looked at Michael. “Is he your FNG?”

“Yep,” Alan replied then looked at Michael‟s

curious eyes. “Why don‟t you take Michael here

along for the ride? Give him some good Nam

experience,” Alan added.

Sonny and Jeff looked at Michael‟s curious

eyes.

“Sure, why not,” Sonny replied.

“What about the supplies?” Michael asked

Alan.



122

“C Squared and I will round them up and

meet you back at the tarmac,” Alan said.

C Squared nodded in agreement with Alan.

“Sure, this sounds interesting,” replied

Michael while he looked at Sonny and Jeff and

his curiosity was in high gear.

“Good, let‟s head out,” Sonny said while he

patted Michael on his shoulder. “Meet my X-ray,

Jeff Barker,” Sonny told Michael while they

walked away.



A little while later, Alan and C Squared went

to the BX on the Air Base while Michael got in

the cargo area of Sonny‟s assault Huey gunship

at the tarmac close to Crusher 5. This Huey

assault chopper was called Viper 8. The nose

art of the Vipers had a curled up nasty snake

with the number “8” in the center.



Ten minutes later, Sonny had Viper 8 up in

the air and flew five hundred feet over the city of

Nha Trang and headed to the beach.

Michael wore and extra flight helmet while

he looked out the opened cargo doors. “Where

can you target practice around here?” Michael

asked and his curiosity peaked.



123

“The only place is out in the beautiful South

China Sea,” Sonny replied.

Michael looked baffled as to how they can

call shooting at waves target practice. He only

saw surfers. “I hope you‟re not shooting at the

surfers.”

Sonny chuckled then there was a moment of

silence while Sonny and Jeff scanned at the

water down below.

“There‟s a target at one at one o‟clock,” Jeff

told Sonny.

“One o‟clock?” Michael asked and started to

get confused while he looked out the Huey‟s

cargo area.

Then Sonny fired off his machine guns at

the water.

“What the fuck?” Michael quietly said while

he wondered why they were shooting at the

water.

“We got it,” Jeff yelled out.

“Got what?” Michael curiously asked.

“We got a shark,” Sonny replied.

“What do you mean you got a shark?”

Michael asked and looked lost.

“We got the bastard. Looks to be a ten

footer,” Jeff added while he glanced down out

his window.



124

Michael glanced down at the water while

Sonny circled the Huey. He saw the pieces of

bloody shark meat floating in the water.

“A live shark? You killed a live shark?”

Michael asked in disbelief.

“Of course. We use the sharks out here for

target practice. They‟re nothing but monsters

anyway,” Jeff replied and did not feel any

remorse for killing the huge fish.

“There‟s another one at the ten o‟clock

position,” Sonny cal ed out while he immediately

banked Viper 8 around to the left to head after

another shark.

Sonny fired his machine guns again.

“Whoa! Got another one,” Jeff yelled out all

excited.

Michael looked down at the water while

Sonny banked the Huey to the right and saw

pieces of shark floating in the bloody patch of

water.

Michael watched while Sonny and Jeff took

turns blowing sharks to bits out in the South

China Sea for their afternoon of target practice.



A little while later, Sonny flew Viper 8 back

to the Nha Trang Air Base.





125

Sonny landed Viper 8 on the tarmac close to

Crusher 5.

After he shut the Huey down, Michael got

out with Sonny and Jeff.

“Thanks for the adventure. Now I can say I

went shark hunting in a Huey. That‟s definitely a

first for me,” Michael said while he shook

Sonny‟s hand.

Sonny and Jeff just cracked a smile while

they watched Michael rushed away all excited.

“I give him about a week then he‟ll realize

this place isn‟t a picnic,” said Sonny.

“Two weeks tops,” Jeff added while they

watched Michael rush over to Crusher 5.

Michael saw Alan and C Squared waiting

inside the cockpit when he arrived at the

chopper.

Then Michael saw that the cargo area was

filled with eight cases of Miller beer, boxes of

chips, and boxes of hamburger meat, steaks,

toilet paper and a bunch of other necessities.

“How was it?” Alan asked while he got out of

the Huey.

“Interesting,” Michael said while he eyed the

cases of beer. “I never thought I would be

hauling beer in a Huey,” Michael added.



126

“The Crushers need their brewsky,” C

Squared said while he got out of the Huey and

proceeded to close the port cargo doors for the

flight back to the LZ.

C Squared walked around and got in the

cargo area on the other side.

Michael and Alan got in the cockpit behind

the controls.



A few minutes later, Michael had Crusher 5

started and the blades were spinning.

After receiving permission from the air base

tower, Michael lifted Crusher 5 off the tarmac

and ascended up in the air in a westerly

direction.



Later that day, Michael started his descent

into LZ Lola after receiving permission.

Michael landed Crusher 5 behind the first

available revetment and shut the engine down.

After the blades slowed down, a Jeep Kaiser

M715 pickup truck drove up and stopped next to

the revetment.

Two privates got out of the Jeep and rushed

over to Crusher 5.

C Squared opened up the cargo door then

hopped out.



127

While the two privates unloaded the cases

of Miller beer, C Squared walked around to the

other side of Crusher 5 and opened up the other

cargo door. He started unloading some cases of

hamburger meat and headed over to the Jeep.

Michael and Alan walked away and headed

back to the tent area.

Michael had a smile that he had the time of

his life. “I‟m gonna love pulling duty here in

Vietnam.”



Alan looked at Michael knowing he would

get a rude awaking of the horrors of Vietnam

any day now.

Michael and Alan headed back to the Lola

Hilton to relax from their supply run.



After some chow at the Eloquent Army

Cuisine tent, Michael went with Alan into another

nearby tent. Above of this tent door was the

words “Party Place” hand painted in white paint

on a piece of scrap wood. This was the tent

where everybody could buy some beer and

forget about the war for a few hours. The tent

had a wooden bar constructed by the enlisted

guys and some tables and chairs.



128

By going inside the Party Palace, it gave

Michael the opportunity to meet some more of

the Cong Crushers that also called LZ Lola their

temporary home away from home.



129





Chapter 10


Later that night inside the Lola Hilton,

Michael was sound asleep in his bunk along with

the other chopper pilots. There were the

occasional snores that filled the air of the tent.

Then a huge smile grew on his face while he

started to dream.



In Michael‟s dream, he lay on his stomach

on a beach in Vietnam. Two Vietnamese girls

also of proper age were by his side. One girl

massaged his legs while the other girl massaged

his back.

“You so big, strong and handsome.

Handsome American,” the girl said while she

massaged Michael‟s back.

“You American have sexy legs,” the other

girl said while she massaged Michael‟s legs.

The girl massaging Michael‟s back leaned

down to his ear. “We both love you long, long

time,” she said then started sucking on his ear

lobe.

“Yes, love you long, long time,” the other girl

added with a horny grin.



130

Michael rolled over on his back and started

kissing the girl that massaged his back.

Then all of a sudden, Michael and the girl

were naked with him on top of her. He had a

boner and slid it inside her. Then he thrust his

hips and a boom sound echoed on the beach.

He thrust his hips again and another boom

sound echoed and shook the sand on the

beach.

“Get the fuck up!” yel ed a male voice

echoed from somewhere on the beach.

Michael looked around the beach and

another boom sound shook the beach.



Back to reality, Michael immediately woke

from his dream to the sound of more booms that

shook the Lola Hilton.

A siren blared throughout the LZ.

He sat up on his bunk in his boxer shorts

and tee shirt. He looked dazed and confused

while the sounds of machine guns were heard

around the perimeter of the LZ.

Through the tent screens, Michael saw

numerous soldiers while they bolted past the

tent in a panic.

Another boom shook the tent.



131

“Get your fucking rifle and let‟s go,” Alan

yelled from his bunk with his M-16 in his hand.

Michael saw Alan in his fatigue pants and

tee shirt.

“Get the fuck up and get grab your M-16,”

Alan yelled while he ran over to Michael‟s bunk.

Then it finally dawned on Michael that the

LZ was under attack.

He jumped off his bunk, grabbed his fatigue

pants and shoved his legs through the pants.

He then grabbed his combat boots and slipped

his bare feet into them and did a half ass job of

lacing them up.

He grabbed his M-16 and followed Alan out

of the tent.



Alan and Michael ran down the row between

the other tents and joined other soldiers.

The sound of numerous M-60 machine and

M-16 guns filled the air while Alan and Michael

ran out of the tent area.

“Yesterday you saw the beauty of Vietnam,

now tonight you‟ll going to see the beast. The

ugly beast,” Alan yelled out at Michael while they

ran to one of the numerous bunkers. These

were known as Dugout Bunkers and were built

all around the perimeter of the LZ.



132

Alan jumped inside the bunker with Michael

right on his heels.

Michael hugged the dirt wall of the bunker

while the sound of M16 machine gun and M-16

fire filled the air from the perimeter of the LZ.

Alan got his M-16 ready and rested the

barrel on one of the sandbags that ran along the

perimeter of the bunker.

He started firing at the Vietcong (VC)

coming after the LZ from the jungle.

Michael looked around the bunker and saw

six other soldiers.

Then a young Private (PVT) named Ernie

Joel ran into the bunker with his M-16.

He knelt down next to Michael‟s right side

and started shooting his M-16 at the threatening

VC.

“Take that you fucking gooks,” yelled out

Private First Class (PFC) Willie Daniels while he

fired his M60 machine guns at the VC. Daniels

was a young African-American from Laurel,

Mississippi. He had dreams of making the Army

a career, as this was his only opportunity to

make a better life for himself.

Michael sat with his back up against the dirt

stunned while everybody in the bunker shot their

weapons.



133

Willie glanced around the bunker and saw

Michael sitting with his back up against the dirt

wall. “Hey man. Are you going to start shooting

or are going to sit there with your finger up your

ass?” Willie yelled at Michael.

Michael looked at his M-16 and for a

second. He forgot how to use it.

“Hey man, it‟s either those gooks or you.

Fire your fucking gun,” Willie yelled out.

Michael realized he better participate or be

tagged a coward. He suddenly remembered his

basic training with the M-16. He got up, flicked

off the safety, and aimed his rifle over the sand

bags. He saw six VC running near the

concertina and razor wire perimeter. He fired off

a shot. He missed the VC.

Willie returned firing his M60 machine gun

with extreme hatred toward the VC.

Eight VC ran toward the concertina and

razor wire. Two of the VC had a plywood plank

in hand to be used as a bridge over the

hazardous concertina and razor wire perimeter.

Michael aimed his M-16 and fired off some

rounds once the two VC placed the plywood

plank over the wire. He saw one of the VC drop

to the ground and he knew he made his first kill.

He saw another VC walk on the plywood plank



134

and he aimed and fired off some more rounds.

He watched while that VC fell off the plank and

landed on the concertina and razor wire. He

made his second kill.

The VC knelt down in the dirt and started

firing their AK-47s at the underground bunkers.

Michael heard a thud to his right. He looked

and Ernie plopped to the dirt on his back with a

bullet hole through his left eye. He was dead.

Michael did not think anything of it at the

moment, as the threatening VC was getting

closer.

The sound of a bunch of Huey helicopters

was heard filling the air.

Then the sound of machine gun fire was

heard coming from the sky.

Michael looked and saw six assault Huey

gunships firing at the approaching VC. It was

Vipers 5, 6, 8, and 15.

The VC started dropping like flies while the

assault Huey‟s came to the rescue.

Michael watched while the Huey gunships

flew by firing off their machine guns. He

wondered if Eric was in one of those Huey

gunships, as he got word that he was assigned

to one of those units.



135

“Cease fire. Cease fire,” Harrington called

out from the LZ loud speakers.

The LZ was suddenly quiet except for the

sound of the Huey‟s flew off for their return

protective flight.

Michael looked and saw about thirty dead

VC in the dirt near the concertina and razor wire

perimeter.

“Let‟s go,” Alan said while he looked over at

Michael then he headed out of the bunker.

Michael looked down at Ernie that lay dead

in the dirt. Then it hit Michael like a truck the

Ernie was dead. He vomited in the dirt.

Willie looked over at Michael while he

continued to hurl in the dirt.

“You okay?” Willie asked while Michael

stopped puking in the dirt.

“Yeah, I arrived the other day. This was my

first gun fight,” Michael said while he looked

down at Joel‟s dead body.

Don‟t worry. You get use to it. My name is

Willie Daniels. I‟m with second squad.”

“I‟m Warrant Officer Michael Grayson. One

of the fucking new guys,” Michael replied while

he wiped his mouth on the left sleeve of his tee

shirt.



136

“Oh shit. I‟m sorry to yell at you like that in

the bunker. I didn‟t know you were a pilot,” said

Willie.

“Don‟t worry. Not a problem. I deserved it,”

Michael said while he headed out of the bunker.

Willie and Michael climbed out of the

bunker.

Michael glanced back at the bunker. “What

was the name of that guy in there? The one that

got kil ed.”

“Ernie Joel. A good ole boy from Georgia,”

Willie replied.

Michael got somber while he thought about

Ernie‟s dead body.

“I‟l catch you later,” Michael said while he

walked away from the bunker and started to feel

a little dizzy.

“Later Mister,” Willis said while he walked off

in another direction with his M60 machine gun.

Michael walked back to the tent area in a bit

of a daze.

He glanced back at the perimeter area and

saw some soldiers out there dragging the dead

VC off to be buried.



Michael walked back inside the Lola Hilton

and headed over to his bunk.



137

He sat down and his eyes welled up while

the thought of what just happened was hitting

him hard.

Alan walked over and noticed Michael was

upset after being in his first battle.

He sat down on Michael‟s bunk next to him.

“I actual y peed my pants the first time I was

in a gun fight over here. This is war and

unfortunately we‟l loose some friends. But

hopeful y we‟ll take out more of those VC than

our friends,” Alan said in a reassuring tone.

“I killed two men tonight. I ended their lives,”

Michael said while he tried to comprehend what

happened earlier.

“Those VC won‟t hesitate in a second to end

your life with a bullet. Just remember that,” Alan

replied.

Michael thought about his replied and

realized he was right.

“Let‟s to grab a few beers to calm your

nerves at the party place,” Alan said while he

patted Michael on his shoulder.

Michael nodded in agreement but then the

sour taste in his mouth reminded him of his

earlier event.

“But first I need to wash out my mouth,” he

told Alan.



138

Alan nodded with a little smile that he

understood, as he heard Michael got sick.

They both got up off the bunk and headed

out of the Lola Hilton.

Michael followed Alan down the rows of

tents and eventually walked up to the Party

Place tent.



Inside the tent was a wooden bar that some

of the enlisted guys constructed and some

government issued tables and chairs.

Hao Nghiem was a middle-aged Vietnamese

guy that worked as a bartender in the evenings.

Everybody in LZ Lola loved Hao and tipped him

good since he had a family to feed. To Hao,

working as their bartender was the highest

paying job he‟s ever had in his life.



After an hour of drinking beers in the Party

Place and after they all paid tribute to the deaths

of Private Ernie Joel, Michael and Alan retired to

the Lola Hilton. It was a long day.

But Michael could not go to sleep as the

sounds of all the machine gun and mortar from

earlier that evening haunted his mind.



139





Chapter 11


Michael only got an hour of sleep and woke

up at the crack of dawn.

Michael grabbed his towel and slipped on

his flip flops. He headed out of the Lola Hilton

and headed over to the shower tent that had a

piece of scrap wood with the “Soapy Palace”

white painted label.



He stepped onto the wooden floor of the

Soapy Palace. Michael stripped naked and

stepped into the shower where the five foot high

wall at least provided some privacy. He turned

on the water that flowed out of a rubber bladder

filled with water. He preferred a hot shower, but

this was better than having body odor for days

on end.



After his shower, Michael headed back to

Lola Hilton and got dressed in his flight suit.

After a few minutes later, Michael headed

out of Lola Hilton and walked over to the

Eloquent Army Cuisine tent for some breakfast.



140

Breakfast this morning consisted of chipped

beef in gravy over a slice of toast that was called

“Shit on a Shingle (SOS),” powdered eggs,

bacon and coffee.



After breakfast, Michael headed back to the

Lola Hilton to kill some time until they were

ready for today‟s mission.

Alan waited inside the Operations tent for

word on a squad of Crushers that were ready to

be extracted from a LZ.

During this wait, Michael decided to write a

letter to home, so he retired to his bunk with a

pad of paper and a pen.

While Michael wrote “Dear Mom” on the

piece of paper, someone entered the tent.

Hooch maid, Kim Ly, a pretty young

Vietnamese girl entered with a broom in hand.

She wore really baggy clothes and had black

rubber sandals on her dirty bare feet. Kim

always acted shy around the soldiers. But she

seemed to be very observant of what‟s going on

around the LZ. She was paid $10 a month per

soldier to do their laundry, shine their shoes and

sweep the dirt off the wooden floors of the

sleeping tents.



141

Kim started sweeping the floor and was

cautious with being quiet so she did not wake

any of the sleeping pilots.

Michael heard the sound of the broom

bristles rubbing across the floor. He looked over

and saw Kim Ly and was immediately smitten by

the sight of her. She appeared to be a foot

shorter than he was but he loved her long silky

black hair and soft brown eyes.

Michael kept a discreet eye on Kim Ly while

she swept the broom in the direction of his bunk.

Michael got off his bunk and walked over to

Kim Ly while she swept the broom over at his

bunk.

“Hello. My name is Michael,” he said with a

warm smile while he extended out his hand.

Kim Ly avoided eye contact with Michael

and did not accept his offer with shaking hands.

“My name is Kim Ly,” she quietly responded in a

shy tone.

“Wel Kim Ly, it‟s a pleasure to meet you,”

Michael replied and thought the Vietnamese

women were intriguing and sexy.

“Me work now,” Kim quietly said while she

continued to sweep the wooden floor and

avoided eye contact with Michael.



142

Michael noticed her black rubber sandals

while he went back to his bunk to finish writing

his letter. He found them odd and appeared to

be homemade.

When Kim got two bunks down from

Michael‟s bunk, she discreetly smiled while she

thought about her brief encounter with him.

Alan stepped inside the Lola Hilton.

“It‟s head off into the sky Michael,” he called

out from the tent opening.

“Shut the fuck up,” one of the sleeping pilots

yelled out after Alan‟s voice woke him up from a

great dream with a sexy woman.

Michael shoved his pad of paper and pen in

his locker and locked it.

He grabbed his flight helmet and glanced at

Kim one last time before leaving the Lola Hilton.

Kim discreetly glanced back at the tent flap

and smiled at the thought of Michael. She went

back to sweeping the floor.



Michael walked through the row between the

tents. “Who was that young Vietnamese girl that

started sweeping the floor?” Michael asked Alan.

“That‟s our Hooch Maid, Kim Ly. We pay

her ten dollars a month to do our laundry, shine



143

our shoes and sweep the floor of the Lola

Hilton,” Alan replied.

“Do you know anything about her?” Michael

curiously asked while they walked out of the row

between the tents and headed to where the

Huey‟s were parked.

“I know very little about her. She seems

sweet and shy. Rumor has it half of her family

was killed by the VC. She doesn‟t talk much.

She just comes in and does her chores around

Lola then leaves. She sometimes walks around

the LZ watching everybody. Why?”

Michael looked at Alan with love in his eyes

while he thought about Kim. “Just curious.”

“Why you horn dog you. You‟re interested in

her,” Alan said after he figured it out.

“What‟s with those black rubber sandals she

wears? They look homemade,” Michael asked

and looked curious.

“Some guys call them Ho Chi Minh racing

slicks.”

“Ho Chi Minh racing slicks?”

“Yeah, the Vietnamese cut up old tires for

the base of the sandal then cut up the inner

tubes for the straps. They are some pretty crafty

people. I have a pair and they are actually

extremely comfortable.”



144

Michael continued to smile while he thought

about Kim and Allan could sense he was really

interested. “Watch out for these Vietnamese

women. Some of them actual y are VC,” said

Alan and he looked serious. “Don‟t let your

pecker get you in trouble.”

“Do you think Kim is VC?” Michael asked.

“No indications so far,” Alan replied while

they walked up to Crusher 5 parked behind its

revetment.

Michael saw C Squared sweeping out the

cargo area of Crusher 5.

“Do you ever sleep? When we come back

from a mission you are working on the ship.

When I first get here you‟re working on the ship.”

Michael asked C Squared.

C Squared picked up a pillow and blanket off

one of the cargo seat. He showed it to Michael.

“A crew chief‟s work is never done,” he said

while he stowed the pillow and blanket away.

Michael started to feel some respect for what a

crew chief does with these helicopters.



“Is she ready?” Alan asked C Squared.

“She‟s a ready,” C Squared replied while sat

in his seat by his 50-caliber machine gun.





145

Michael and Alan got inside Crusher 5

behind the controls.

Michael started the start-up procedure of

Crusher 5.

“Where are we going? On another supply

run?” Michael asked while the blades started to

slowly spin around. He was looking forward to

another afternoon on the beach.

“Extract some Cong Crushers at a LZ,” Alan

replied.

“Is it hot?” C Squared asked.

“Not according to the Cong Crushers we‟re

picking up,” Alan replied.

Michael looked a little nervous while he

recal ed last night‟s episode. He looked out his

window and saw Crushers 2, and 3 starting up

their engines.



Five minutes later, Crushers 2, 3, and 5

ascended up into the sky.



A little while later, Michael flew Crusher 5 in

formation along with Crushers 2, and 3. This

would be his first formation flight in war and he

was a little nervous. Crusher 5 flew at the rear

of the formation while they descended down to

tree top level.



146

C Squared kept a vigil down below for any

signs of VC and had his machine ready to

protect their chopper.

“There‟s the landing zone cal ed Rascal,”

Alan said while he pointed at the red smoke in

the middle of a clearing in the jungle.

“Got it,” Michael said.

“Let me fly her in since this is your first

mission,” Alan said.

“Okay,” Michael replied then removed his

hands off the controls once he saw Alan had his

hands on his controls.

“Crusher Two coming in,” Rusty the aircraft

commander said from the radio.

Michael watched while Crusher 2 landed

and seven soldiers ran over to the waiting Huey.

It looked like two of the soldiers were carrying a

body to the waiting chopper.

“Crusher Three coming in,” 1LT Lieutenant

Jay “Crazy Jay” Granger the aircraft commander

said from the radio.

Michael watched while Crusher 3 started

descending down to the LZ.

“Crusher Two taking off,” Rusty said from

the radio.



147

Michael saw eight other soldiers running to

Crusher 3 while Crusher 2 ascended up into the

sky.

“Crusher Five coming in,” Alan said into the

radio then he descended down to the LZ.

“Crusher Three taking off,” Crazy Jay said

from the radio.

Michael watched while Crusher 3 ascended

up into the sky while Alan descended down to

the LZ.

“Crusher Three taking off,” Crazy Jay said

from the radio.

Michael watched while eight Cong Crushers

ran over to their Huey the second the skids

touched the ground.

“We‟re fucking hot!” C Squared yel ed out

when he saw some VC at the tree line. He

started firing his machine guns at the VC racing

out of the jungle.

That caused Michael heart to jump, as he

was not prepared for that sound.

Then the sound of gunfire came from the VC

at the tree line.

Michael saw Crusher PVT Larry Monroe

drop to the ground when he turned toward the

tree line to fire his M-16.



148

Cong Crushers CPL Doug Thompson and

PVT Cody Edwards rushed back over to PVT

Moore.

They quickly picked him up off the ground

and dragged him over to Crusher 5.

C Squared provided coverage with his

machine gun.

Michael saw two of the VC drop to the

ground from being hit by the machine gun of C

Squared.

“Ahhhh!” Larry cried out in pain while the two

other Cong Crushers, Thompson and Edwards

dragged him over to Crusher 5.

SSG Brian Dyer ran behind then

occasionally fired his M-16 at the VC at the tree

line.

“Ahhhh!” Larry continued to scream out in

pain while his two buddies tossed him inside the

cargo area of Crusher 5.

Brian, Thompson, and Edwards jumped in

the cargo area of Crusher 5 while C Squared

continued with his machine gun coverage.

“Crusher Five taking off and we‟re under

fire,” Alan said in the radio while he quickly lifted

Crusher 5 off the ground.



149

Then all of a sudden, Larry stopped

screaming. All you could hear was C Squared

firing his machine gun at the VC.

“Don‟t leave me Larry,” Brian yelled out at

Larry who started convulsing.

Michael turned around and saw a bloody

gaping wound in Larry‟s chest and his eyes were

opened with a lifeless stare.

Brian‟s eyes wel ed up when he realized that

Monroe had died. Brian treated all his troops

like they were his kids since he was much older.

Michael was shocked as this was the

second dead person he had seen in the past two

days.



The sound of bullets pelting the bottom of

Crusher 5 was heard.

Some bullets hit Michael‟s chin bubble on

Crusher 5.

Michael looked down at his chin bubble and

saw three bullet holes. He peed in his flight suit,

as this was the first time in his life that he came

close to being shot.

C Squared continued to fire his machine gun

down at the trees while Alan ascended Crusher

5 into the sky.





150

A few minutes later, C Squared quit firing

when he realized they were out of range.

It was quiet in Crusher 5 except for the

unique sound of the Hueys blades.

Michael was embarrassed for peeing in his

flight suit.



It was a somber ride in Crusher 5 while

Michael flew back to LZ Lola. The Cong

Crushers in the cargo area silently mourned the

loss of their friend.



151





Chapter 12


Later that day, Michael landed Crusher 5 in

a spot back at LZ Lola.

After he shut down the engine and the

blades started slowing down, one of the Cong

Crushers grabbed Monroe‟s dead body and

dragged him out of the cargo area.

They carried him away to be sent home in a

body bag.

C Squared looked at the pool of blood on

the floor of the cargo area of Crusher 5. He did

not look thrilled with cleaning it out the chopper.

C Squared walked away to get a bucket of

water and a scrub brush.

Michael got out of Crusher 5 and saw the

pool of blood in the cargo area. He did not know

what to think knowing a young man recently died

on that spot.

“It goes with the territory,” Alan said while he

walked over to Michael and noticed him staring

at Monroe‟s pool of blood.

“I just can‟t get the face of that dead soldier

out of my head and the fact that I almost got my

feet shot off,” Michael told Alan.



152

“Now you‟re seeing the beast in Vietnam.

It‟s pretty ugly but you‟l get use to it,” Alan said

while he patted Michael on his shoulder. “Let‟s

get a couple of beers,” he added then walked

Michael away from Crusher 5.



An hour and three beers later, Michael

walked out of the Party Place and decided he

needed a haircut.

He entered the small tent that was the LZ

barbershop.



Inside the barber tent were two Vietnamese

Barbers, Bao and Hein Trung. Both men were

middle aged but looked older. They had been

the barbers at LZ Lola for the past year.

Michael walked into the tent and saw Bao

giving 1LT Russ Durkin a shave and then a

haircut.

He saw Hein waiting in the other chair for his

next customer.

“You haircut?” Hein cal ed out from his chair.

“Yeah,” Michael replied while he walked

over to Hein.

Hein got out of the chair and dusted it off

with his towel while Michael walked over.



153

The second Michael plopped his butt in the

chair, Hein placed a clean towel around

Michael‟s neck and shoulder.

“Just a trim,” Michael told Hein.

Hein nodded in agreement that he

understood and grabbed his scissors and

clippers.

While Hein started trimming Michael‟s hair,

he glanced in the mirror that faced him.

“Yep Bao, I‟m leaving tomorrow. My tour in

Nam is over and I‟m getting the fuck out of this

Army,” Russ said with a smile on his face.

“Me happy for you,” Bao replied with a fake

smile, as he could care less while he wiped off

the residual shaving cream off Russ‟ face.

Michael glanced over at the door. His eyes

lit up the second he saw Kim Ly enter the tent

with a broom in her hand.

He watched her while she started sweeping

away the dirt and hair clippings on the wooden

floor.

Kim swept the broom close to Michael‟s

chair.

“Hello there,” Michael said the second she

got close to him.



Kim looked at Michael and gave him a shy

smile and continued sweeping.



154

Michael continued to watch Kim from the

mirror while she swept the floor.

Hein finished with Michael‟s trim and then he

suddenly slapped the back of Michael‟s neck a

few times. This took Michael completely by

surprise and got pissed.

He jumped out of the chair and faced Hein

while he rubbed the back of his neck. “Why the

fuck did you do that?” he said wanting to punch

Hein.

Bao slapped the back of Russ‟ neck a few

times.

“Easy there. It‟s part of the way they do

haircuts. Hein‟s cool. You‟l start to like it,” Russ

told Michael while he got out of his chair.

Russ paid Bao for the haircut then he looked

at Michael. “You must be one of the fucking

new guys,” he asked Michael.

Michael nodded in agreement.

“Figures,” Dunkin said while he cracked a

smile and walked to the door of the tent.

Michael glanced over at Kim who giggled at

him over Hein slapping his neck.

“Oh do I make you laugh?” he asked Kim.

Kim started to feel less shy around Michael.

“Yes. You funny.”



155

“Wel , why don‟t we go have a beer and do

some more laughing,” Michael offered her.

Kim glanced over at Hein with a look that

she needed his permission.

He nodded in agreement that she could go

have a beer with Michael.

Kim placed her broom over by one of the

tent walls.

Kim and Michael walked out of the tent.



Kim was shy and quiet while they walked

away from the barber tent.

Then Michael remembered something. He

reached in one of his fatigue pockets and

removed a $10 bill. “Here, I heard you charge

ten dollars a month to sweep the tent, shine

shoes,” Michael said while he handed her the

money.

“Also laundry,” Kim replied with a smile and

took the bill and shoved it into her dirty pants.

They had a quiet walk over to the Party

Place.

Michael stepped inside the Party Place

where there were eight Cong Crushers drinking

beer. The Everyday People song by Sly and the

Family Stone played on the radio.



156

Michael walked over to the bar and bought

two Miller beers from Hao.

Hao glared at Kim while he opened the two

can of beers. He had a look that he did not

approve of Kim socializing with Michael.

She ignored his glares while Michael

handed her a beer.

He escorted Kim out of the tent.



She remained shy and quiet while they

walked away from the Party Place.

Michael walked Kim around to the area

where the Hueys were parked. They walked

over to the port side of Crusher 5 where C

Squared had finished cleaning the cargo area an

hour ago.

“Here‟s what I fly,” Michael said while he

stood by Crusher 5 and looked proud.

“You a pilot?” she asked while she looked

interested in the Huey.

“Yep, I‟m a helicopter pilot,” he boasted

while he puffed out his chest.

“Let‟s relax,” Michael offered while he

walked her over to the cargo area. He offered

his hand to assist her up into the Huey.

Kim nodded in agreement and accepted his

hand.



157

Michael assisted Kim while she got inside

the cargo area of Crusher 5 and sat down in the

canvass seat.

Michael climbed inside Crusher 5 and sat

next to her.

She took a sip of her beer.

He took a sip of his beer.

“Yep. I‟ve wanted to fly a helicopter pilot

since I was a kid.”

“Where you go when you fly?” Kim curiously

asked then sipped on her beer.

“Oh, we drop off the Cong Crushers and

then we pick them up from various landing

zones.”

“How you fly it?” she curiously asked then

took another sip.

“Come, I‟ll give you a quick introduction to

this marvelous machine,” Michael replied while

he placed his beer can down.

She set her beer can down while he jumped

out of Crusher 5. He assisted Kim down to the

ground.

Michael grabbed Kim by her hand and

walked her over to the cockpit. He opened the

door and sat her down in the seat.

He grabbed her right hand and placed it on

the cyclic control. He placed her left hand on



158

the throttle of the collective. Then he reached

down and placed her sandals on the anti-torque

pedals.

The sound of Crusher 22 was heard starting

up its engines nearby.

He moved her right hand and moved the

cyclic forward. “This makes her go forward.”

He moved her right hand and moved the

cyclic backwards. “This makes her go

backwards.”

He moved her right hand and moved the

cyclic to the right. “This makes her go to the

right.”

He moved her right hand and moved the

cyclic to the left. “This makes her go to the left.”

He then moved her left hand up and moved

the collective up. “This makes her go up.”

He then moved her left hand up and moved

the collective down. “This makes her go down.”

The nearby Crusher 22‟s engine was revved

up and its blades were spinning.

Michael assisted Kim out of the cockpit.

Wally lifted Crusher 22 up in the air and

started to move forward while it ascended. The

front skids made contact with the metal

revetment wall and it flipped over and crashed.



159

Michael immediately used his body and

shielded Kim while the blades of Crusher 22

started digging into the dirt and snapped off.

Dust flew everywhere.

The dust settled and Michael and Kim were

spared from injures.

Michael and Kim gazed into each other

eyes. He leaned down to Kim and kissed her

lips.

She did not resist and they embraced in a

passionate kiss.

Michael decided to take a chance. He

grabbed Kim‟s hand and walked her back to the

cargo area. She did not resist.

He assisted her back inside. He looked at

Crusher 22 and saw four Cong Crushers rush

over to help the crew members of that crashed

Huey.

Wally, Nathan, and SP4 James Paul

survived the crash with some minor injuries.



Michael and Kim kissed for a few minutes

inside Crusher 5 and then Michael closed the

cargo doors for privacy. She did not resist and

he knew his mission would commence.

Michael lowered his pants and boxers. He

removed Kim‟s pants. She still did not resist.



160

They started kissing again. Then she lay on her

back. He climbed on top of her and was inside

in a few seconds.

Outside Crusher 5, soldiers milling about the

area did not notice the Huey while it rocked a

little to the rhythm of Michael and Kim getting it

on.



Fifteen minutes had passed and Michael

and Kim got dressed. He opened the port side

cargo door and assisted her out of the cargo

area of Crusher 5.

He walked her to the front gate of the LZ.

After he gave Kim a good night kiss, he

glanced down at her feet at those Ho Chi Minh

racing slicks. “Can you get me a pair of those

sandals?” he asked while he pointed down at

her feet.

Kim looked down at Michael‟s boots then at

him. She nodded that she could arrange that

then she rushed off through the front gate of LZ

Lola.

Kim got on her rusty bicycle that she left out

by the front gate when she arrived earlier in the

day.



161

She rode away from LZ Lola and headed to

the local village where she lived in a hut with her

elderly mother.



Michael returned to Lola Hilton with a huge

grin. Once he got to his bunk, he spotted a

letter on his bunk from his mother, a letter from

Eric from Fort Benning, and a letter from Kevin

from Germany.

He got on his bunk and immediately opened

and read the letters.

Elaine wrote that nothing much had

happened in the Glendale area.

Kevin wrote that he was having a blast in

Germany and wished Michael could get a

transfer there. But Michael knew that would

never happen. Besides, he actually wanted to

stay in Vietnam to spend more time with Kim.

Eric wrote that he was doing good in Fort

Benning and that assignment was getting

boring. He stated that he was thinking of putting

in a request for an assignment in Vietnam.

After he read the letters, he decided to write

them a letter. He grabbed his pad of paper and

pen from his locker and started writing.





162

An hour had passed and Michael had those

three letters sealed and dropped off at the

mailbag.

He returned to the Lola Hilton to retired for

the night.

Michael lay in bed and stared at the top of

the ten and couldn‟t get thoughts of Kim out of

his mind. He was in love for the first time in his

life and the thought of possible marriage entered

his mind.

“Fuck!” Biannotti yelled out.

Michael looked over at Biannotti who was

rummaging through his locker.

“Who the fuck stole my money?” Biannotti

yelled out with fire in his eyes.

“Did you leave it unlocked?” Frank yelled out

from his bunk.

“No,” Biannotti said while he looked down at

his locker.

“You probably forgot you spent it all on

beer,” Frank yelled back.

Biannotti scratched his head and could not

remember if he spent it all on beer. Biannotti

locked his locker and lay on his bunk pondering

if he spent his $40 or someone stole it.

Michael could care less about Biannotti

missing money as he still had Kim on his mind.



163



The next morning arrived and Michael

returned from showering at the Soapy Palace.

He walked up to his bunk and found a pair of

Ho Chi Minh slicks by his locker. He picked up

one of the sandals and checked it over. He saw

the front and rear straps were made out of inner

tube and were just shoved into slits of the

bottom of the sandal. He checked out the

bottom and saw that it was in fact cut out of an

old vehicle tire with the thread on the bottom.

“Creative. Extremely creative,” he said while he

dropped the sandal to the floor. He then

removed his combat boots and socks then

slipped his feet into the sandals. They were a

perfect fit. “How did she know my size?” he

wondered while he walked around a little and

Allan was right, they were comfortable.

Michael headed out of the Lola Hilton and

headed off to the Fine Army Cuisine tent for

some more powered eggs breakfast. He was

proud of his Ho Chi Minh racing slicks while he

ate breakfast.



164





Chapter 13


The months flew by and the war raged

onward with more soldiers watching their fellow

soldiers die or being severely injured.

Also during that time, Michael had the

opportunity for a little fun. He went to Manila for

a week for a little Intoxication and Intercourse (I

& &) as what some of the guys called it. But

Michael just drank, as he did not want to screw

with any other Vietnamese woman. He tried to

take Kim with him, but that would be too risky,

as LTC Harrington would have his ass in a sling.

But he took his pair of Ho Chi Ming racing slicks

with him and felt that part of Kim was with him.



It was now June.

Michael saw more action and picked up

more dead Cong Crushers from the jungle. But

seeing Kim was the beautiful sunshine of his day

and kept him going. Sergeant (SGT) Gary

Kilson, who worked in the supply tent, notified

LTC Harrington that a PRC-10 backpack field

radio, two M-16s and bullets were deemed

missing during his monthly inventory task.



165

Also during this month, Michael also

witnessed Crusher 19 get shot down by VC in

the jungle. Crusher 19 was descending to

picking up some Crushers at LZ Wayne. WO3

Ralph Zimmerman survived with a broken leg

and shoulder blade, but his X-Ray Carl Wendell

just arrived in Vietnam three weeks ago and met

the grim reaper already.

Michael also received letters from his mom,

and Kevin, and those always cheered him up.



During July, it was hot and humid and this

Vietnam weather was nothing like the summers

back home in California. Michael sweated off

about fifteen pounds from the heat. But the

periodic romantic encounters with Kim made it

all worth wild.

Also during July, Gary reported to

Harrington that three more M-16 rifles,

grenades, and bullets were again missing from

the supply tent. Harrington had a meeting in the

Operations and jumped in the Cong Crushers

shit for the missing rifles, bullets, and grenades.

He also started to have concerns that one of his

troops might be stealing the weapons and

selling them on the black market.





166

Michael received more letters from mom and

a letter from Kevin. But nothing from Eric.

Kevin wrote that he had a blast in Germany

with the German beer and the girls. Kevin

briefly mentioned that he started to see a young

girl named Joanna. He did not go into much

detail about Joanna but said he had to sneak

around to take her out on dates.

Michael also witnessed Crusher 12 get shot

down and crashed into a ball of fire. Doug,

Albert, and SP4 John Berry were killed instantly.

Michael was shocked that Biannotti was killed.

He remembered the first day they arrived to LZ

Lola.

July also had everybody in LZ Lola glued to

the radio to listen to the news reports about the

Apollo 11 Moon landing. They were all

impressed that man had the technology to land

on the Moon. They knew that our Astronauts

would visit other planets, like Mars, during the

next thirty years.

But it was those occasional romantic

moments at night with Kim that kept the

memories of all those Cong Crushers that died

that month.





167

During August, the heat continued to cook

the troops in Vietnam. And the bugs and

mosquitoes continued to have a feast on the

exposed skins of the soldiers.

Michael continued to fall deeper in love with

Kim and cherished every second she was at LZ

Lola. His time spent with Kim helped him forget

about the deaths of all those soldiers he picked

up from the landing zones.

Also during August, Crusher 10 was shot

down after dropping off some Cong Crushers at

a landing zone. It crashed into some trees. The

VC rushed to the wreckage and made sure WO2

Wally Benson, WO1 Gary Henderson, and SGT

Karl Woodside would not make it home.



September rolled around and two more M16

rifles along with a box of ammunition were found

missing. Harrington blew his top and accused

Gary of selling the missing items on the black

market. But he could not prove anything and did

not want to go through the tons of paperwork for

a court-martial. So Harrington had Gary

transferred to another infantry unit where he

would be out in the thick of the jungle.



168

Then Crusher 6 was shot down after

dropping off some Cong Crushers. Billy, Chuck,

and Jesse did not survive the fiery crash.



It was a Monday morning around the middle

of September and the sun had just peeked over

the horizon.



Michael was inside the Eloquent Army

Cuisine tent eating his shit on a shingle and

powered egg breakfast wearing his Ho Chi Minh

racing slicks. He was on his second cup of

coffee. He had on his mind, as he had not seen

her in four days. She said she had to spend

some time with her sick mother.

Alan walked over to Michael.

“How was the meeting with Harrington?”

Michael asked.

“We need to go take a walk,” Alan said and

looked serious while he stood by Michael and

glared down at him.

“Can I finish my breakfast first?” Michael

asked then took a drink.

“Hurry up. This can‟t wait any longer,” Alan

said while he pretended to look pissed with

Michael.



169

“Okay,” Michael and started to scarf down

this breakfast while he sensed Alan had some

bad news by the serious look on his face.

After Michael finished his breakfast, he

walked out of the Eloquent Army Cuisine tent

with Alan.

“What‟s so important that you had to rush

my breakfast,” Michael asked while they left the

tent.

“Colonel Harrington wanted some feedback

about you,” Alan said while he walked Michael

toward the Huey revetment area.

“Did I screw up?” Michael asked and was

concerned that he might be taken off flight

status. But he could not recall any incident that

might be interpreted as a fuck up.

“No, Harrington replied then he looked at

Michael and still had his serious look.

Michael just knew he was in deep shit for

Harrington based on Alan‟s behavior.

“He wants you to move up to aircraft

commander soon. He‟s expecting some

replacement pilots next month,” Alan replied

then a smile grew on his face that indicated he

was proud of Michael.

It took a few seconds for it to dawn on

Michael that he was not in deep shit. “You had



170

me. I thought I was going to get my ass chewed

out,” he said then he looked excited about taking

command of his own Huey.

“Therefore, Harrington would like for you to

fly with one of our other aircraft commanders

before you take command,” Alan said while they

walked up to Crusher 3.

Michael saw Crusher 3 and it took a few

seconds for it to dawn on him. “I‟m going to be

Crazy Jay‟s X-Ray?” he asked Alan.

“Yep,” Alan replied with a smirk knowing that

Michael would hopefully have some fond

memories he could laugh about over some

beers in the future.

Crazy Jay walked around his Huey for a last

glance inspection before the mission.

“Who will be your X-Ray?” Michael curiously

asked, as he really did not want to stop flying

with Alan.

“One of those fucking new guys, Wilbur

Wilson,” Alan said and glanced over at Crusher

5 where C Squared was inspecting the rotor

system and WO1 Wilbur Wilson waited by the

nose for Alan.

Michael glanced over and saw Wilson

waiting for Alan.



171

“Jay, here‟s your X-Ray,” Alan called out to

Crazy Jay.

“Welcome aboard Michael,” Crazy Jay

called out while he looked over the tail rotor

blade.

“Wel , good luck and I‟ll be seeing you up in

the sky,” Alan said while he patted Michael on

his shoulder with a smirk.

Alan walked away and headed to Crusher 5

while Crazy Jay walked over to Michael.

“Are you ready to go?” Crazy Jay asked

Michael.

Michael looked a little leery of flying with his

new aircraft commander. “I guess so. Where

are we going?” Michael asked.

“Dropping off some Cong Crushers ten miles

southwest of Da Lat. We got a report from a

Bird Dog that around twenty VC were out there

moving toward in the direction of the Ta n Son

Nhut airfield,” Crazy Jay replied.

Michael still looked leery of flying with Crazy

Jay.

“Hey chief,” Crazy Jay called out to SP4

Jerry Bradshaw who was on top of Crusher 3

inspecting the rotor blade linkage.

“Welcome Mister Grayson,” Jerry said while

he climbed down off the top of Crusher 3.



172

“I‟m Jerry Bradshaw, in case you didn‟t

know,” he said while he walked over to Michael.

They shook hands while another squad of

eight Cong Crushers walked up to Crusher 3

with their M-16s in hand and Rucksacks on their

backs. They were ready for another mission of

crushing the VC.

Another squad of eight Cong Crushers

walked over to Crusher Two also ready for

another mission in the jungle.

Eight other Cong Crushers walked over to

Crusher 5.

“Let‟s get up in the air,” Crazy Jay said while

he walked over and got in on the starboard side.

Michael got in the port side while Jerry got in

position behind his M-60 machine gun in the

cargo area.

After Michael and Crazy Jay got situated in

their seats behind the controls, Michael started

up Crusher 3. The blades started to spin a few

seconds later.

Crusher 2 and Crusher 5 were also starting

up at the same time.



Five minutes later, Crushers 2, 3, and 5

lifted up from behind their metal revetments and

started their ascent into the sky.



173

A few minutes later, the three Hueys banked

to the left in formation and headed in a

southwesterly direction.



Thirty minutes later, Crushers 2, 3, and 5

were flying in formation at one thousand feet

above the ground.

The Crushers flew in formation toward some

rice paddies.



From inside Crusher 3, Michael was in

command while Crazy Jay was concentrating on

the rice paddies for any signs of VC.

A few minutes later, Crazy Jay‟s eyes lit up

with a smile. “We got a squatter,” he cal ed out

all excited.

“A what?” Michael asked Crazy Jay.

“Someone squatting in the rice paddy,”

Crazy Jay said he pointed to their ten o‟clock

position. “I‟ll take command now,” Crazy Jay

added.

Michael released his hands off the cyclic

and collective controls after Crazy Jay took over.

“I got a squatter at ten o‟clock,” Crazy Jay

said into the radio.

“Here we again,” Rusty from Crusher 2

called out from the radio.



174

“Have fun, Michael,” Alan cal ed out from the

radio.

Michael looked a little baffled Crazy Jay

banked Crusher 3 to the left and started a fast

descent down to a dot in the rice paddy. He

tugged on his harness to tighten its grip on his

body.



An elderly South Vietnamese farmer was

squatting by the edge of the dike running

through the rice paddy. His pants were down at

his ankles and his bare ass hung a foot above

the dike‟s nasty water. He was a little

constipated and was straining hard. He also did

not pay attention to the sound of the

approaching Huey, as he‟s heard them so often

during the past couple of years.

The sound of an approaching Huey got

louder.

The farmer was too preoccupied with

dumping into the dike‟s water to notice the

helicopter.

The sound of the approaching Huey got

louder.

The farmer started to get concerned when

the sound of the blades of Crusher 3 got even

louder. He glanced up at the sky. The farmer



175

saw Crusher 3 racing down toward him. But he

was now relieving himself and did not want to

stop this long awaited moment.

He watched Crusher 3 pulled out of the dive

and was soon flying about five feet above the

rice paddy. He just continued dumping into the

dike even though the Huey was flying straight at

him.



Inside Crusher 3, Crazy Jay had a crazy

look in his eyes and a huge grin while he raced

the Huey at the squatting farmer.



Back in the rice paddy, the farmer was still

doing his business and starting to get really

nervous while Crusher 3 was closer.

Crusher 3 zoomed over the farmer‟s head at

five feet above the ground. The farmer panicked

and fell backwards into the dike.

The farmer was steaming mad while he sat

in the dirty water of the dike.

He stood up and turned around and

searched the sky for Crusher 3. He saw it

ascending back into the sky to join the other

Hueys. “Fucking asshole American,” the farmer

yelled out in Vietnamese while he shook his fist

at the Huey.



176

He pulled up his soggy pants and stepped

out of the dike.

The farmer walked back to tending his rice

paddy while the Crusher helicopters few away.



Ten minutes later, Crushers 2, 3 and 5 flew

toward another rice paddy miles away from that

farmer.

“There‟s LZ Mongoose,” Crazy Jay called

out into the radio.

“The VC should be west of here heading in

the direction of Tan Son Nhut airfield,” Alan

replied from the radio.

“Crusher Two going in,” Rusty replied from

the radio.

Crazy Jay and Michael watched while

Crusher 2 descended down to the rice paddy.

“Crusher three is going in,” Crazy Jay said

into the radio and started his descent down to

the rice paddy.

“Okay guys, who are we?” the leader of this

squad yelled out from the cargo area of Crusher

3.

“Cong Crushers,” the rest of squad yelled

out then stomped on the floor of the cargo area

in unison.



177

Michael smiled at this Cong Crushers

tradition before they were dropped off in a LZ.

He never got tired of it.

“Crusher Five going in,” Alan said from the

radio.

Crusher 2 hovered a few feet above the rice

paddy while the Cong Crushers jumped out and

splashed into the rice patty. They all ran

through the water to the trees.

Crusher 2 ascended back into the air with

Jerry aiming his M60 machine gun down at the

ground in case the VC appeared. The rice

paddy appeared safe.

Crusher 3 hovered a few feet above the rice

paddy while the Cong Crushers jumped out and

splashed into the rice patty. They all ran

through the water to the trees after the other

Cong Crushers.

Crusher 3 ascended back into the air with

SP4 Harvey Whitestone aiming his M60

machine gun down at the ground in case the VC

appeared. The rice paddy still appeared safe.



Crusher 5 hovered a few feet above the rice

paddy while the Cong Crushers jumped out and

splashed into the rice patty. They all ran



178

through the water to the trees after the other

Cong Crushers.

Crusher 5 ascended up to join Crushers 2

and 3. C Squared aimed his M60 machine gun

down at the ground in case the VC appeared.

The rice paddy still appeared safe. Then all of a

sudden, C Squared eyes widened the second he

saw a bunch of moving black dots in the trees.

They were racing to the rice paddy with the

backs of the Cong Crushers in sight.

Twenty-five VC appeared in the rice paddy.

They started firing their AK-47s at the Cong

Crushers and at the ascending Crusher 5.

Bullets penetrated the side of Crusher 5 and

some of them went through the cargo area. C

Squared received numerous bullets through his

chest. He slouched over dead and died with

very little pain.

“The LZ is now hot!” Alan yel ed into the

radio while he ascended upward.

More bullets hit the engine compartment.

Black smoke bellowed out.

“We‟re going down,” Alan yel ed out into the

radio while black smoke bellowed out of the

engine compartment and the needles of his

engine gauges started going haywire.



179

Michael was worried after hearing Alan‟s

radio call.

Then some bullets hit the nose of Crusher 3.

“Fuck!” Michael yelled while a few bullets

just missed his legs by inches.

Then he remembered Alan‟s radio cal and

craned his neck to see if Crusher 5 was still in

the air. He could not see anything.

Crusher‟s 2 and 3 continued their ascent

into the sky and were soon away from the battle

that started down below in the rice paddy.

The Cong Crushers and the VC started a

gun battle that would soon bloody the rice

paddy.



It was quiet inside Crusher 3 while they flew

back to LZ Lola.

“Crusher five, are you there?” Crazy Jay

called out into the radio.

Alan did not reply on the radio.

Michael got sick to his stomach fearing the

worse.



Later that day, Crushers 2 and 3 received

permission on the radio from the Sarge to land.



180

The skids of the two Hueys soon touched

down in the first available spots behind two

revetment walls.

After Michael shut down Crusher 3, he

headed to the Party Place in a bit of a daze of

what happened during the mission. He had Alan

and C Squared on his mind and was worried to

death since Crusher 5 did not land after they

landed.



He sat in the tent and drank some Miller

beers still worried about the fate of Crusher 5.

He listened to the Leaving On A Jet Plane

song that played on the radio. All he could think

about was getting on a jet plane and heading

back to California. But he wanted to make sure

he could take Kim along with him. He knew his

mom and dad would love her the second they

met her.

How can I buy a ring? He thought to himself

while he sipped on his can of Miller beer while

the joyous thoughts of marriage flooded through

his mind. He wished Kim was here, but she was

still visiting her mother.



Nighttime fell upon LZ Lola.



181

Michael had a sick feeling in the pit of his

stomach when he did not hear anything about

Alan and C Squared.

He had a difficult time falling asleep that

night while he knew that Alan‟s bunk was still

empty.



182





Chapter 14


The next day arrived and Michael was

finished with his evening chow of something that

resembled steak. It was not bad but nothing like

what his dad would grill.

After he had a few beers in the Party Place,

Michael headed back to the Lola Hilton. The

fate of Alan and C Squared still weighed heavy

on his mind. Plus he wondered how Kim was

doing with her sick mom.

Then all too familiar music of Hueys

suddenly filled the air indicating Crushers 7, 9

and 14 were landing back at LZ Lola. The three

Hueys went out to pick up the Cong Crushers

that Michael and the others dropped off earlier

today. Their mission the send out to complete

yesterday was apparently a bust. The only VC

they encountered was at LZ Wayne.

Michael ran toward the revetment area while

the Hueys landed.

An ambulance pulled up next to the

revetment area.

He watched whi le Crushers 7, 9, and 14

landed in available spots.



183

Michael watched while six Cong Crushers

got out two badly injured buddies out of Crusher

7.

Four Medics rushed over to Crusher 7 with

two stretchers in hand.

He then watched while eight Cong Crushers

got out uninjured from Crusher 14.

Then Michael turned his eyes on Crusher 9

and saw three motionless bodies on the floor of

the cargo area of the Huey. His stomach got

nervous.

He saw the eight Cong Crushers get out

while another ambulance pulled up.

Six Medics got out of the ambulance and

rushed over to Crusher 9 with three stretchers.

The six Medics stopped and talked with two

of the Cong Crushers who hung out by Crusher

9.

Michael could tell by their conservation that

it could not be good.

He watched while the Medics placed the

three lifeless bodies on the stretchers.

Michael rushed over to the ambulance.

He watched while the four Medics carried

the stretchers over to the ambulance.

He wanted to break down crying the second

he realized that the three dead bodies was Alan,



184

C Squared, and the new X-Ray Wilbur. The

poor kid was only in Vietnam for two weeks

when his return flight home would be in a body

bag.

Michael just stared at Alan‟s lifeless body

while the two Medics placed the stretcher in the

back of the ambulance.

Then it hit Michael like a ton of bricks that he

could have been on Crusher 5. He could have

been dead at this exact moment.

Michael walked away from the ambulance

feeling sick.

He only made it ten feet from the ambulance

and he dropped to his knees. He vomited into

the dirt thinking about Alan and C Squared.

Michael got up on his feet and moped back

to the Lola Hilton.

In another area by one of the revetment

walls, LTC Harrington and Sarge watched the

ambulance drive away. Harrington hated his

duty of notifying the families of the killed

soldiers. He hated it with a passion. He turned

around and walked back to his tent. Sarge lit

up a fresh Camel then took a drag. He turned

around and followed Harrington.





185

Michael went back to Lola Hilton to lay down

on his bunk. He silently cried about the loss of

the first two friends he made here.



An hour had passed and Michael fell asleep.

Kim entered the Lola Hilton and saw Michael

in his bunk.

She walked over to Michael‟s bunk and

looked down at him while he slept. She lightly

moved Michael to wake him up.

Michael opened his eyes and glanced up at

Kim. “Hey baby,” he said with a little smile.

Kim sat down on the edge of Michael‟s

bunk. She leaned down and gave him a little

kiss in his lips. “I hear Alan kil ed by VC,” she

said.

“How did you know?” he asked while he sat

up and was a little surprised.

“I heard some soldier talk about it. They say

that Alan and everybody in Huey was shot by

VC,” Kim replied and looked sad.

Michael‟s eyes welled up and Kim held his

hand for comfort.

“We walk around. You‟ll feel better,” Kim

said while she stood up holding Michael‟s hand.

Michael smiled at her and got up off his

bunk.



186

They held hands while they walked out of

the Lola Hilton.



Michael and Kim walked around the LZ and

he remained quiet. Kim on the other hand was

looking the LZ over like she was trying to

memorize the layout.



A little while later, the sun was dropping

behind the trees for a beautiful sunset.

Michael and Kim walked into the Party

Place.

They sat at the bar and ordered two beers

so Michael could drink his sorrows awa y.

CPL Keith Messing rolled a 16mm projector

into the tent. He rolled it down to the other from

the bar.

Calvin walked into the tent carrying a

projector screen. He walked over to the front of

the bar. He started setting up the screen.

Calvin was the administrative assistant to

Harrington and Sarge and also worked the radio

when Sarge was not available

“What‟s playing tonight?” Michael asked

Calvin.

“Spooks Run Wild,” Calvin replied while he

made the final adjustments to the screen.



187

“Want to watch the movie?” Michael asked

Kim.

She hesitated as if she had somewhere else

to be at this moment. “I never heard movie

Spooks Run Wild,” Kim replied.

“You‟l love it. It stars the East Side Kids

who did many movies back in the forties,”

Michael replied while he recalled seeing them on

TV back in the fifties.

She nodded that she would stay and watch

the movie.



Five minutes later, fifteen Cong Crushers

entered the tent ready to watch a movie to take

their minds off the war.

The bar closed down since Hao was feeling

sick and wanted to return to his village. And

besides, the projector screen blocked access to

the bar anyway.

Michael and Kim moved away from the bar

and sat at a small table near the tent entrance.

This was per her request.

Calvin started the projector and the movie

started playing with the opening credits.

And a couple of Cong Crushers could not

help but shove their hands into the light and



188

make shadow puppets for a few seconds. They

were still kids at heart.



After a few minutes, Kim looked antsy and

concerned. She looked at the screen that

showed Danny, Muggs, and Glimpy at a sweet

shop soda fountain flirting with a blonde girl.

“How long movie?” Kim curiously asked

while she looked around the tent and saw it was

packed with Cong Crushers.

“An hour,” Michael replied while his eyes

were glued to the screen.

“I go now,” she said while she leaned over to

Michael.

“Where are you going? The movie just

started,” Michael asked while he watched the

movie where Danny, Muggs, and Glimpy missed

the bus and high tailed it out of the sweet shop.

“I go home to mother. Make sure she well,”

Kim said while she leaned over and kissed

Michael on his cheek.

“Can‟t you stay a little longer?” he pleaded

her.

“No, I go now,” she said then stood up and

rushed over to the door and rushed out of the

tent.



189

Michael looked concerned while she had to

leave in such hurry. He shrugged it off and went

back to watching the movie.



Thirty minutes passed and Michael watched

the scene of the movie where two of the East

Side Kids are inside a dark house. Muggs sat

behind a desk where candles lit the dark den.

Glimpy and three other kids were by Muggs.

Muggs freaks out after he opened a container

and sees a skull inside.

Then out of the peaceful night, the boom of

a mortar attack shook the tent.

Everybody froze for a second while they

could not believe that the war was interrupting

their movie.

Another boom from another mortar attack

shook the tent knocking the projector off the

table.

The movie was showing on one of the side

of the tent.

Machine gun fire was heard coming from the

perimeter of the LZ.

Footsteps were heard while other Cong

Crushers ran to the bunkers with their M-16s.

“Fucking VC!” one of the Cong Crushers

yelled out from inside the tent.



190

Everybody jumped up and scrambled to the

tent door.

The projector reels jammed. The scene in

the movie froze where Muggs, Glimpy and the

three other kids headed to the door of the den.

A burn mark was projected on the side of the

tent while the bulb burned the 16mm film and

burned the away Mugs, Glimpy and the three

other kids.

Michael ran out of the tent in a panic with

the crowd of Cong Crushers.



It was utter chaos outside LZ Lola while

some Cong Crushers ran to their tents to get

their M-16s and while other Cong Crushers ran

to the bunkers with their M-16s in hand.

The music of machine gun fire from the

Cong Crushers firing at the VC filled the air.

A mortar round hit the Party Place and it

exploded into a ball of flames.

A few minutes later, six Cong Crushers with

fire extinguishers started putting out the flames

that were once their place to get the war out of

their minds. They were pissed about losing their

cases of beer, and were very determined to

build a new one.



191

Michael settled into a bunker with six other

Cong Crushers. He did not waste a second and

started firing his M-16 at the VC. They were

situated at the edge of the jungle firing back with

their AK-47 rifles at LZ Lola.

Michael saw a VC step out of the jungle and

started to sneak to the perimeter of the LZ. He

aimed his M-16 and fired off a few founds. The

VC dropped dead to the dirt.

Michael and the other guys in the bunker

saw six VC running toward the concertina and

razor wire at the perimeter of the LZ.



Michael and the other guys aimed their M-16

rifles at the approaching VC and fired off a

bunch of rounds.

The six VC dropped to the dirt dead.

Then the sound of approaching Hueys filled

the air.

Fifteen VC ran out of the jungle and headed

to the perimeter of LZ Lola.

Michael and the guys in the bunker looked

and saw two Viper assault Hueys racing to the

rescue about two hundred feet off the ground.

A bullet from a VC zinged inches past

Michael‟s right arm. He ducked down for cover.

The assault Hueys named Viper 4 and 8

fired their machine guns unmercifully at the VC



192

while they ran to the perimeter. The Vipers were

from LZ Snake Pit that was about fifteen miles

away. They got a call to come in and assist LZ

Lola.

All fifteen VC dropped dead to the dirt.

Vipers 4 and 8 made ascending banks to the

right.

The jungle was quiet.

The LZ was quiet while everybody waited to

see if any more VC would attempt to attack.

The jungle was still quiet while Vipers 4 and

8 made another pass two hundred feet by the

LZ. The did not fire their machine guns.



After a few minutes, the word that the VC

was no longer a threat spread around the LZ like

wildfire.

Everybody in Michael‟s bunker started

cheering while Vipers 4 and 8 flew away to head

back to LZ Snake Pit.

“Who are we?” a soldier yel ed out from a

nearby bunker.

“Cong Crushers!” a bunch of soldiers yelled

out in unison followed by the thump, thump

sound while their boots stomping on the dirt.

Everybody started climbing out of the

bunkers.



193

Michael headed back to the Lola Hilton

exhausted and worried the LZ havi ng another

attack. He wondered if he would survive the

next one.



An hour later, all the dead VC were picked

up and moved to another location in the LZ for

later disposal.

Michael lay in his bunk and thought about

the war and Kim. The he felt a little pain on his

right arm. He looked over at it and saw his

fatigue shirt had a little tear in it. He realized it

was from that bullet that zinged past his arm.

He sat up and removed his shirt and saw

that the bullet grazed his arm. Nothing serious

that warranted a trip to the Medical tent. He was

not going to get a Purple Heart for a little bloody

scratch. But he still felt a little faint over this

minor wound.

He tossed his shirt on the floor then lay back

down on his bunk. He silently prayed he would

make it out of Vietnam alive. He also silently

prayed that Kim would survive the war so he

could take her home to Glendale.



194





Chapter 15


The next morning arrived and LZ Lola was

quiet from last night‟s attack.

Michael lay in his bunk and stared at the top

of the Lola Hilton tent while he could not get last

night‟s attack out of his mind.

“Good Morning Vietnam!” Armed Forces

Radio Network Pat Sajak the DJ yelled from the

radio that one of the guys in the tent had turned

on.

After a few good words to the troops out in

the field, Pat played the Honky Tonk Woman

song by the Rolling Stones on the radio.

Michael got up, and grabbed his towel,

soap, and toothpaste and brush out of his

locker. He slipped his bare feet into his pair of

Ho Chi Minh racing slicks.

He walked out of the Lola Hilton and headed

to Shitter Way then after that had plans to head

to the Soapy Palace. The burnt smell of the

remains of the Party Palace filled the air of LZ

Lola this morning. A crew of enlisted guys was

already meeting in the Operations tent to get a



195

replacement party tent built. The LZ had some

extra tents in storage for this type of situation.

After Michael took care of his morning

hygiene tasks, he got dressed in his flight suit

and headed to the Eloquent Army Cuisine tent

for the fine breakfast the Army provided the

troops free of charge.



After breakfast and some coffee and a quick

trip to Shitter Way, Michael met with Crazy Jay

outside the Eloquent Army Cuisine tent.

“Are you ready?” Crazy Jay asked Michael.

“Yep. I like these types of missions,”

Michael replied with he walked with Crazy Jay

toward the parked Hueys.

A few minutes later, Michael and Crazy Jay

walked over to Crusher 3.

“Where‟s Jerry? He should be doing the

preflight,” Crazy Jay said out loud while he didn‟t

see Jerry by the Huey.

Crazy Jay and Michael walked around

Crusher 3 looking for Jerry.

They found find him dozing off on the cargo

area floor.

Crazy Jay motioned at Michael to be quiet.

He tiptoed over toward the cargo area to

Jerry. He slammed his fist down on the floor of



196

the cargo area inches from Jerry‟s sleeping

head.

Jerry jumped up in a panic thinking there

was another mortar attack.

Crazy Jay laughed at the sight of Jerry who

looked dazed and a little confused.

Michael smiled at the sight of Jerry.

“Did you preflight? We‟re taking off soon,”

Crazy Jay asked Jerry while he yawned.

Jerry wiped the sleepy out of his eyes,

stretched and yawned. “Yeah, she‟s ready.

Where we going?”

“We have an easy day. Ash and trash at

Cam Rahn,” Crazy Jay said while he walked

over to his side of Crusher 3.

“What are we picking up?” Jerry asked.

“The mail, some food, beer, and four fucking

new guys,” Crazy Jay said while he slipped on

his flight helmet.

A Jeep drove up and parked nearby while

Michael slipped on his flight helmet.

PVT Jimmy Young jumped out and grabbed

a mailbag from the back of the Jeep.

“Here‟s the outgoing mail,” Jimmy yelled out

at Jerry.

Jimmy walked over to Crusher 3 and

dropped the mailbag in the cargo area.



197

Jimmy rushed back to his Jeep, jumped

back behind the wheel and drove away.

Jerry secured the mailbag then he sat

behind the machine gun.

Michael and Crazy Jay got into their

respective seats behind their controls.

A few minutes later, Michael had Crusher 3

started and the blades were soon spinning.

A few minutes later, Michael ascended

Crusher 3 up into the air and headed in an

easterly direction.



It was a quiet and enjoyable ride to Cam

Rahn without any sightings of VC.



Later that morning, Michael landed Crusher

3 at the flight line at the Cam Rahn Air Base.

Michael shut down the Huey and he got out

with Crazy Jay and Jerry.

“Let‟s go check on the fucking new guys,”

Crazy Jay told Michael.

“I‟l to take care of the mail, the food, and the

beer,” Jerry said while he removed the mailbag

out of the cargo area.

Crazy Jay and Michael headed off towards

the Flight Operations building.



198

Jerry headed off in another direction with the

mailbag in hand.



A few minutes later, Crazy Jay and Michael

entered the Flight Operations building and found

their four FNGs waiting.

“I‟m Lieutenant Jay Granger also known as

Crazy Jay, and this is Mister Michael Grayson,”

Crazy Jay addressed the new troops.

Michael looked at the new guys and his

mouth dropped and he could not believe his

eyes. He wiped them and did a double take.

“Kevin? What are you doing here?” Michael

said all excited to see his childhood friend Kevin.

“Surprise, surprise,” PFC Kevin Coogan said

while he stood up and rushed over to Michael.

He still had his carrot top and freckles sprinkled

all over his pale skin.

Crazy Jay watched while Michael and Kevin

hugged. “We typical y don‟t hug the new guys,”

he told Michael.

“Kevin and I grew up back home in

California,” Michael told Crazy Jay then glanced

back at Kevin. “I thought you were stationed in

Germany?”



199

“Wel , it‟s bit of a long story. I‟ll have to tell

you later,” Kevin said and looked a little

ashamed.

Crazy Jay removed a piece of paper from

his flight suit. “I guess that takes care of PFC

Coogan,” he said while he glanced at the paper

that had the list of names of the new guys.

“Okay, then you other guys must be Private

Kenny Press, Private Jeremy Kinston, and

Private First Class Hank Chadwick,” Crazy Jay

said while he continued to glance at the piece of

paper.

“Yes sir,” Jeremy, Kenny, and Hank all

replied in unison.

“Good, now lets get you guys to your new

comfy home,” Crazy Jay said then headed to the

door.

“I don‟t fucking believe it,” Michael told Kevin

while Kevin picked up his duffel bag

Michael and Kevin walked to the door while

Jeremy, Kenny, and Hank picked up their duffel

bags.



Kevin looked excited to be riding in a Huey

while they all walked over to Crusher 3.

Jerry just arrived in a Jeep that stopped by

Crusher 3 where in the back was ten cases of



200

beer, a new mail bag, two cartons of canned

coffee, powered eggs, and other odds and ends

like cigars, cigarettes and toilet paper.

Jerry removed a mailbag from the rear of the

Jeep while the Private started to unload the

cases of beer.

“Help unload the Jeep,” Crazy Jay told the

new guys.

After Kevin and the new guys unloaded then

duffel bags into the cargo area of Crusher 3,

they started unloading the jeep.

The second the Jeep was unloaded and the

cargo of Crusher 3 was packed, the Private

drove away.

“Jerry, meet our fucking new guys, Kevin

Coogan, Kenny Press, Jeremy Kinston, and

Hank Chadwick,” he said.

“I‟m Jerry Bradshaw,” he replied while he

shook hands with the new guys.

“Fucking new guys?” Kevin asked Michael.

“We‟re all cal ed that at first,” Michael replied

while he opened his cockpit door.

“Let‟s go,” Jerry told the new guys while he

got inside and sat behind his machine gun.

Michael and Crazy Jay got in the cockpit

while Kevin and the other guys got inside the

cargo area and got buckled in the cargo seat.



201



After a few minutes, Michael had Crusher 3

started and the blades were slicing their way

through the air.

Michael lifted the Huey off the flight line and

flew off.

Kevin sat in the cargo area and looked

proud that his best friend was finally a helicopter

pilot. “I thought I‟d never see the day where I

would ride in a chopper that you flew,” he cal ed

out.

Michael just gave Michael a left Thumbs Up

sign while kept an eye on his flying.

Kevin, Hank, Kenny and Jeremy glanced out

the cargo area and enjoyed the view of Vietnam

from the air.

“This looks like peaceful country,” Kevin

called out.

“And beautiful countryside,” Kenny added.

Jeremy and Hank nodded in agreement.

Michael and Crazy Jay glanced over at each

other and knew that attitude would change in a

day or two.

“Enjoy the peaceful ride while it lasts

fel ows,” Crazy Jay called out while Michael

headed Crusher 3 in a westerly direction.



202

Kevin, Hank, Jeremy, and Kenny glanced at

each other and knew what he meant. They

were not excited about that part coming true.



A little while later, Crazy Jay‟s eyes lit up

when he saw dirt road down below and a M35

A1 Deuce truck without the canvas top. The

Deuce truck was full of soldiers and had two

Jeep escorts in front with machine guns. The

vehicles left a trail of dust down the dirt road.

Crazy Jay glanced over at Michael with a

smirk. “I‟ll take the controls,” he told Michael.

Michael knew Crazy Jay was going to pull

off another one of his antics, but could not figure

out what.

Once Crazy Jay had control of the cyclic,

collective and pedals, Michael looked around to

the area to determine his crazy move. Then he

spotted the Deuce truck with the two Jeeps

down below on the dirt road down below.

“Oh no. What are you up to?” Michael

asked Crazy Jay.

“A little initiation time for the FNGs,” Crazy

Jay replied with a smirk and wink.

“Shit. Here we go again,” Michael said while

he tugged on his harnesses to make sure he

was safely snug in his seat.



203

Crazy Jay suddenly dove Crusher 3 down at

the Deuce truck and the two Jeeps.

The eyes of Kevin, Hank, Kenny, and

Jeremy widen in surprise with the sudden nose

dive of the Huey.

“Are we under attack?” Jeremy yelled out in

a bit of a panic while craned his neck to look out

the cargo area for signs of threatening VC.

Kevin, Hank, Kenny, and Jeremy looked

around for signs of some type of threatening

North Vietnamese aircraft.

“No. Something different,” Michael yelled

out.

Kevin, Hank, Kenny, and Jeremy looked a

little confused as to why the Huey took a sudden

dive.

“Are we having engine trouble and going to

crash?” Hank yelled out and gripped the edge of

the canvas seat with white knuckles.

“No,” Michael yelled back with a little smirk

while he watched while Crusher 3 raced toward

the Jeeps and Deuce truck.

Kevin, Hank, Kenny, and Jeremy were still

clueless, as to why the Huey was diving down to

the ground. The rest of the new guys braced for

a crash.



204

Jerry glanced back and chuckled at the sight

of the new guys holding on tight with white

knuckles to their seats with fear in their eyes.



In the back of the M35 A1 Deuce truck, the

Army soldiers were smoking cigarettes,

bullshitting, or dozing off.

“What the hell is he doing?” SSG Ralph

Jenson asked while he saw that Crusher 3 was

fifty feet off the ground and headed straight in

their direction.

All the soldiers in the back of the Deuce

truck looked when they heard the familiar of the

approaching Huey.

They watched while Crusher 3 hovered

behind the Deuce truck and followed it down the

dirt road.

Some of the soldiers removed cameras out

of their fatigue shirts and snapped some

pictures.

The soldiers in the Deuce truck watched

while Crusher 3 moved over to the left and flew

even with their truck.

“Grab the controls,” Crazy Jay told Michael.

Michael took the control of Crusher 3.

Crazy Jay then removed a cardboard sign

he had tucked away and held it up.



205

The soldiers looked at the “God Bless You”

sign that Crazy Jay held up in his door window

while he saluted them.

The soldiers in the back of the truck cheered

at the Huey.

“Let‟s get out of here,” Crazy Jay told

Michael.

Michael moved Crusher 3 to the right and

started to ascent it into the sky.



Inside Crusher 3, Kevin, Hank, Kenny and

Jeremy thought that maneuver was cool.

“What was on the sign?” Kevin called out.

Crazy Jay turned around and showed them

his sign.

Kevin, Jeremy, Hank and Kenny thought

that was even cooler while Crazy Jay tucked

away his sign.

The four new guys sat there and watched

while Michael flew Crusher 3 back to LZ Lola.



A little while later, Michael descended

Crusher 3 down to LZ Lola.

From the air, Kevin, Hank, Kenny, and

Jeremy saw the concertina and razor wire and

underground bunkers with machine guns around



206

the perimeter of the LZ. They were not

impressed.

The guys then saw numerous rows of Army

green canvas tents with sandbag revetments

around them.

They noticed landing areas with metal

revetments for the Hueys. Some Hueys were

parked there and they saw some bare spots

meaning some were out on a mission.

They saw eight soldiers playing football in a

dirt area.

They saw a bunch of soldiers walking

around and catching some sunrays.

Michael landed the Huey in one of the

opened landing areas.

After Michael shut the Huey down and the

blades slowed, Kevin, Hank, Kenny, and Jeremy

grabbed their duffel bags and hopped out of the

chopper.

“Welcome to Landing Zone Lola, the home

of the Cong Crushers,” Jerry said while he got

out of the Huey with the new guys.

“Let‟s get your guys checked in,” Crazy Jay

said after he got out of the Huey.

Michael got out of the Huey and still could

not believe his eyes that his best friend was here

in Vietnam with him.



207

Kevin, Hank, Kenny, and Jeremy followed

Michael, Crazy Jay and Jerry away from the

Huey and headed to the tent area.

Jerry stayed with Crusher 3 for a Jeep to

arrive to unload their supplies.

They walked past the “Welcome to LZ Lola.

Home of the Cong Crushers” sign. They noticed

the Cong Crushers cartoon artwork on the sign

and thought it was cool.

Then the strong stench of a sewer smell hit

them like a brick wall.

“What is that a wful smell?” Kevin asked

Michael while he pinched off his nose.

Hank started having the dry heaves.

“We burn the shit from the latrines,” Michael

replied while he pointed in the direction of the

stench.

Kevin, Hank, Kenny, and Jeremy looked

where Michael pointed and saw some privates

standing by three small barrels that were on fire.

Kevin really missed the comfort of Germany

when he saw his new home away from home.

“Welcome to Nam my friend,” Michael said

while he got a chuckle at the guys who could not

believe their eyes at the sight of shit being

burned.



208

“We‟l take you to meet Colonel Harrington

and then get settled into your bunk. Afterwards,

we‟l go have some beers and catch up,”

Michael told Kevin while they walked down the

dirt aisle between some tents.



209





Chapter 16


Two hours had passed and Kevin was

situated in his tent called Holiday Lola and had

his gear stored in his locker.

He left his new home and headed meet

Michael at the new Party Place Two tent. The

remains of the old tent were cleaned up and a

new tent was installed. But the bar now

consisted of a table instead of a wooden bar. It

would take some time for the guys to construct a

new one. The only bad thing about Party Palace

Two was the remaining burnt smell that still

lingered in the air.



Kevin walked into the Party Place Two and

found Michael sitting at a table with two cans of

Miller beer.

Michael was all smiles when he saw Kevin

walking over to the table.

“So, what happened in Germany?” Michael

asked the second Kevin plopped his butt down

on the chair.

“I fucked up. Really bad,” Kevin said then he

took a drink of beer.



210

“What did you do?” Michael curiously asked

then he took a drink of beer.

“Wel , her name was Joanna Reed, and she

was this sweet young girl that I met. Long

blonde hair, the bluest eyes and a knock out

body,” Kevin said and smiled while he

remembered her.

“It‟s sounding good so far,” replied Michael.

“It was really good except for the fact that

Joanna was sixteen years old and the daughter

of the base commander, General Reed,” Kevin

responded and did not appear happy while he

recalled memories of his encounter with her.

“Oh, that‟s not good,” Michael replied and

knew there was something interesting going to

come out of this story.

“He blew his lid when we were caught

fooling around in the backseat of my

Volkswagen Beetle. I had my hand down inside

her panties,” Kevin said then took a drink of his

beer.

“Her father caught you?”

“No, an MP Corporal did and turned me into

the General. He figured it would buy him some

fucking brownie points for making Sergeant,”

Kevin replied and wished he could take a swing

at that MP.



211

“So I take it that‟s why you‟re here?”

Kevin nodded in agreement. “General Reed

didn‟t want the hassle of the paperwork for a

court martial, so he had me transferred to

Vietnam. He figured that would be punishment

enough.”

“But, how did you get assigned to the Cong

Crushers?” Michael asked knowing it could not

have been pure luck.

“My first sergeant liked me and thought

General Reed was the biggest asshole in the

world. So he had some connections and I asked

him to get me stationed with you,” Kevin replied.

“Wel I‟m glad buddy,” Michael said then

raised his beer can up at Kevin.

Kevin and Michael clanked beer cans

together to celebrate them being together once

again.

“I couldn‟t believe my luck, I just stuck my

finger in her wet pussy when there was a tap on

my rear window. I looked and saw that MP

peeking inside my car window. Joanna got so

scared that her pussy tightened up and I

wondered if I would be able to remove my

finger,” Kevin added with a smirk.

Michael chuckled then took another drink of

his beer.



212

“Speaking of pussy, I have a girlfriend over

here,” Michael said and looked happy.

“Girlfriend? Is she Vietnamese? She has to

be, as I haven‟t seen any American pussy here.”

Michael nodded with a smile. “Her name is

Kim,” Michael added with sparkles in his eyes

while he thought about her.

“Where is she?”

“She‟s visiting her mom over in a vil age

about ten miles from here,” Michael replied then

took another drink of beer.

“You got some oriental pussy. I‟ve heard it

goes sideways,” Kevin said in a joking manner.

Michael chuckled. “I can verify that looks

just like American pussy.”

Kevin chuckled then took another drink o f

his beer.

Michael looked at Kevin‟s left hand. “I see

you‟re wearing our old high school class ring,”

he said.

Kevin set his beer can down on the table

then looked down at his ring. “Yeah, it covers

the spot were my wedding ring once was and

helps me forget about my short-lived marriage,”

he said and looked sad while recalled those few

happy times he had with Nancy.



213

“Sorry about that. I really liked Nancy and

you two were a good couple.”

“That‟s life,” Kevin replied then took a large

drink of his beer.

Michael finished up the rest of his beer.

“Oh, by the way, I saw your folks and your

mom wanted me to give you a hug for her,”

Kevin said.

“How about a handshake. Guys hugging

here doesn‟t sit well with most of these ground

pounders,” Michael replied.

Kevin chuckled, as he was not planning on

hugging Michael and wanted to mess with him a

little.

“Want another beer?” Michael asked.

“Sure. But after drinking that German beer,

American beer starts to taste like water.”

Michael got up and walked over to the bar.

While Kevin was buying two beers from

Hao, Kevin noticed his rubber sandals.

Michael walked back to their table with two

cans of Miller beer in hand. He set one down in

from of Kevin then sat down.

“What‟s with those black rubber sandals?

Look like something you found in the trash.”

Michael plopped his right sandal up on the

table. “These are called Ho Chi Minh racing



214

slicks. Kim got them for me and they‟re really

comfortable. I can get you a pair if you want.”

Kevin looked at them and still thought they

were something you picked out of the trash. “No

thanks.”

Michael set his foot back on the floor. They

returned to drinking beer and catching up with

things since high school.



Meanwhile, back in Glendale, California,

Elaine Grayson sat at the di ning room table

reading a letter for the second time today. Harry

sat next to her and glanced over the letter. In

the background, the television was visible from

the living room.

“Dear Mom and Dad, Things are real busy

here at LZ Lola. I‟m getting a lot of flight time

with tons of take offs and landings and some

action. Some of these missions are pretty

dangerous. But don‟t worry I‟m doing okay. I

met this Vietnamese girl. I think I‟m in love. Her

name is Kim Ly and I‟l try to send you a picture

of her. She‟s beautiful. It also looks like I‟m

going to be an aircraft commander real soon

meaning I‟ll be in charge of my own Huey. It

should give me a promotion also. I can‟t wait.



215

Wel , I‟l write soon. Love, Michael,” Elaine said

while she read Michael‟s letter out loud.

“An now for today‟s body count,” the news

anchor said from the television.

Elaine and Harry glanced over at the

television and hated this part of the evening

news.

Elaine‟s eyes wel ed up while she thought

about Michael and Kevin being over in Vietnam.

Harry hid his concern for Michael being in

Vietnam, but knew it was his sons duty like his

duty to fight in Korea.



Back in Vietnam, Michael and Kevin drank

two more beers before retiring for the night.

They were caught up with their lives since high

school.

Michael did not have any trouble falling

asleep, as he was used to his new home.

Kevin on the other hand could not get

comfortable in his bunk and hated living in a

tent.



The evening was quiet and morning soon

arrived for another day of war.



216

Michael woke up and after cleaning up at

the Soapy Place he headed over for some fine

Army breakfast at the Eloquent Army Cuisine.

After he ate he headed back to the Lola

Hilton. He slipped his feet out of his Ho Chi

Minh racing slick then got dressed in his flight

suit.

He headed out to the Operations tent to

hear about today‟s mission.



Michael met Crazy Jay and Jerry at Crusher

3.

While Michael and Crazy Jay got inside the

cockpit, Michael saw Kevin walking with his new

Cong Crushers squad. They were walking to

Crusher 8.

Michael waved at Kevin, but his friend did

not see him. His mind was on his first time with

going out to potential engage with some VC.

Michael started up Crusher 3 while another

Cong Crushers squad climbed about his Huey.

While the blades of Crusher 3 started

circling around, Michael eyed Crusher 8 and

saw Kevin sitting in the back of that Huey.

Crusher 14 started up after another squad of

Cong Crushers got inside that Huey.



217

A few minutes later, Crushers 3, 8, and 14

ascended up into the air.



Twenty minutes later, the three Hueys were

at tree top level heading to LZ Lion to drop of the

Cong Crushers.

Michael eyed Crusher 8 while it led the

formation to the LZ.

“Crusher eight coming in,” Chris said from

the radio while he ascended his Huey down to

the LZ Lion.

Michael watched while Crusher 8 touched

down in the field.

“Crusher three coming in,” Michael said into

the radio while he made his descent to the LZ

Lion.

“Okay guys, who are we?” yel ed the leader

of this squad from the cargo area of Crusher 3.

“Cong Crushers,” the rest of squad yelled

out then stomped on the floor of the cargo area

in unison.

“Crusher eight taking off,” Chris said from

the radio.

Michael landed the Huey and the eight Cong

Crushers jumped out and ran to the jungle.



218

“Crusher fourteen coming in,” WO2 Henry

Douglas said into the radio then he descended

down to the LZ.

“Crusher three taking off,” Michael said from

the radio.

Michael lifted the Huey up off the ground

and ascended into the sky to join Crusher 8.

While Michael‟s Huey cleared the top of the

trees, all he could think about was Kevin down

there jumping out of Crusher 14 to fight with the

VC.

“Crusher fourteen taking off,” Henry said

from the radio the second he lifted up off the

ground.

Michael flew Crusher 3 in formation with

Crushers 8, and 14 back to LZ Lola.

He silently prayed that Kevin would survive

his first mission in the jungle.



Twenty minutes later, Crushers 3, 8, and 14

landed back at LZ Lola.

After Michael shut down the Huey, he went

back to Lola Hilton to relax.



After ten minutes of lying in deep thought on

his bunk, Kim entered with a broom. She

started sweeping the dirt off the floor.



219

The sound of the broom bristles against the

wood snapped Michael out of his deep thought

with a smile.

Kim swept her way over to Michael while he

sat up on his bunk.

Michael stood up and walked over to Kim.

He planted a kiss on the lips.

“How‟s your mother doing?” asked while he

brushed her bangs out of her eyes.

“She good,” Kim replied while she looked

down at the floor.

“Can I see you later tonight?” he asked while

he placed a hand on her shoulder.

Kim nodded in agreement then gave

Michael a quick kiss on his lips.

“Mister Grayson, Colonel Harrington needs

to see you ASAP,” Calvin yelled out from the

door of the tent.

“I work now,” she said then returned to

sweeping the floor.

“I‟l see you tonight at nine by Crusher

three,” Michael said then he walked away to the

door.

Kim smiled to indicate she would meet him

tonight.

Michael rushed out of the Lola Hilton.





220

Michael followed Calvin while he headed to

Harrington‟s tent that had a piece of scrap wood

with “The Boss‟ Tent” label with white paint.



Back in the Lola Hilton, Kim noticed one of

the lockers by a bunk was left unlocked. She

glanced around the tent to make sure she was

alone. She was so she rushed over to the

locker.

She opened up the locker and rummaged

through it. She found $100 stuffed in a pair of

socks. She took the cash and shoved it into a

pocket she had sewn on the inside of her pants.

She closed the trunk and locked it.

Kim rushed out of the tent with her broom.



Back in The Boss‟ Tent, Calvin sat down at

his little desk and went back to work on his

Royal manual typewriter.

Michael walked up to Sarge‟s desk where

behind it was the radio that the Cong Crushers

used to establish permission to land, take-off

and other contact while on a mission.

Sarge sipped his cup of coffee while he

looked up at Michael. He had a lit Camel in his

ashtray.



221

Sarge got up with his coffee cup in hand.

He walked over a door that led into Harrington‟s

small office.

Sarge knocked on the door then opened it

up. He poked his head inside. “Grayson is

here,” he told Harrington.

“Send him in,” Harrington was heard from

inside his office.

Sarge motioned for Michael to go inside.

Michael was a little nervous while he

stepped inside the Harrington‟s office. He

wondered if he was going to get his ass chewed

up for spending romantic moments with Kim.

“You wanted to see me, sir?” Michael asked

while Harrington read some paperwork.

“Yeah Grayson. I got word that your Huey is

ready to be picked up at Cam Rahn in the

morning. Crazy Jay can fly you over there,”

Harrington said then he sipped some coffee.

“Yes sir,” Michael replied with a gleam in his

eye about the thought of being air commander of

his own Huey.

“And, since you‟re our new air commander,

you‟re getting promoted,” Harrington said while

he opened up one of his desk drawers. He got

up from his chair with two pairs of WO2 bars and

four copies of the promotion orders.



222

“Congratulations, you earned it,” he said while

he walked over to Michael.

Harrington handed Michael the WO2 bars

and orders. They shook hands.

“You‟l be Crusher Fifteen. Dismissed,”

Harrington said then turned around and walked

back to his desk.

Michael walked out of Harrington‟s office.

Michael rushed out of the tent with a huge

grin on his face.

Sarge and Calvin could care less and were

busy process the required tons of Army

paperwork.



Michael strutted through LZ Lola and

headed to the Party Place Two to have a beer to

celebrate his promotion.

Michael got to the entrance of the Party

Place Two then remembered that Kevin was out

there in the jungle. He decided to have his

celebration beer with Kevin tomorrow night.

Michael rushed back to the Lola Hilton

wanting to tell Kim about his good news.



Michael rushed into Lola Hilton. He looked

around and saw Kim had left. He figured she

was off sweeping the floor of another tent so he



223

rushed over to his bunk, and removed his WO1

bars off his flight suit and installed his new WO2

bars.

He unlocked his locker and dropped his

orders inside. He closed the locker and locked

it.

Michael rushed out of the Lola Hilton.



Michael rushed around LZ Lola in search of

Kim, but she was nowhere to be found.



Michael went back to the Lola Hilton and

decided to relax and hopefully he would find Kim

later on.



The night soon arrived and Kim made her

way back into LZ Lola.

She found Michael waiting by Crusher 3

drinking a can of Miller beer and wore his Ho Chi

Minh racing slicks.

“Hey baby,” Michael said the second he saw

Kim walking over to him.

He gave her a kiss on the lips.

“Let‟s get inside. I have something

important to ask you,” he told her while he held

one of her hands.



224

Michael assisted Kim into the cargo area,

and closed both cargo doors.

Kim looked a little nervous.

Michael held one of Kim‟s hands. “I‟ve been

doing some serious thinking, and I want to take

you back with me to the states,” he told her.

“Me? Back to the states? How?” Kim

curiously asked him.

“I can take you back to the states if we get

married,” Michael replied and kissed her hand.

“You marry me?” Kim replied and looked

happy.

“I love you Kim and want to spend the rest of

my life with you,” Michael said while he gazed

into her eyes.

Kim nodded in agreement that she would

marry Michael.

He was the happiest guy in the world right

now. He leaned over and kissed Kim.

While they were kissing, Michael slid his

hand into Kim‟s pants and headed to her crotch.

He wanted to celebrate their engagement.

She immediately removed his hand. “You

wait until honeymoon,” Kim said.

“You‟re right,” Michael said then placed his

arm around her shoulder. Then his eyes

widened when he remembered the earlier event.



225

“Oh, I got promoted and I‟m going to be an

aircraft commander of my own Huey. I‟ll pick it

up tomorrow morning at Cam Rahn,” he said

with a huge grin.

“Me happy for you,” Kim replied with a warm

smile.

Michael and Kim cuddled in the cargo of

Crusher 3.

“I get scared when you fly,” she said and

looked worried.

“I know. Me too,” he replied but he was not

thinking about the war, he was thinking about a

long life with Kim back in the states with a few

kids to raise.

“Where next mission?” Kim asked.

“Why do you want to know?” he replied.

“Me worry you won‟t make it back,” Kim

replied and looked worried.

“I don‟t know yet,” he responded and kissed

the top of her head.

“Me still worry about you,” Kim replied and

cuddled closer to Michael.



While Michael and Kim cuddled in Crusher

3, Kevin was twenty miles away deep in the

jungle trying to get some sleep with the other

Cong Crushers.



226

He was nestled in some vegetation and

swatted away the insects that were nipping at

his neck and face. Kevin was on his two-hour

shift of guard duty while the rest of the Cong

Crushers slept. Every little noise made Kevin

jump inside thinking the VC was out there ready

to kill him.

He was also had the memory of killing a VC

earlier today. This was the first time Kevin took

the life of another human being. His eyes welled

up at the thought of killing that teenage VC boy

who had a rifle aimed at him. He also had a

hard time believing that there were Vietnamese

girls fighting for the VC.

Kevin tried his best forget that incident while

every little noise in the jungle made him jump

inside.

The two other squads of Cong Crushers

were also nestled in the jungle vegetation about

fifty yards away.



227





Chapter 17


The next morning arrived and Michael woke

up excited about getting his new Huey and

marrying Kim.

After a shower and the fine Army breakfast,

Michael got dressed in his flight suit and headed

to the Operations tent.



Inside the Operations tent, Crazy Jay,

Oliver, and Jerry waited with SP4 Chaz White,

and WO1 Bruce Tolison. Chaz and Bruce were

assigned as Michael‟s crew members for

Crusher 15. Oliver was reassigned as Crazy

Jay‟s X-Ray, as he was slated to become an

aircraft commander soon.

“Let‟s head east,” Crazy Jay told everybody.

Michael followed Crazy Jay and the rest out

of the Operations tent.



“Here‟s the plan. While you‟re getting your

new Huey ready, I‟m going to stock up on some

more supplies, like beer. We also have three

fucking new guys to pick up,” Crazy Jay told



228

Michael while they walked through LZ Lola and

headed toward the parked Hueys.



Ten minutes later, Crusher 3 ascended up

and away from LZ Lola.

Michael sat in the cargo area with Chaz and

Bruce. Michael was in heaven thinking about

taking command of his own Huey. His own

personal Huey in his mind.



Meanwhile, twenty miles to the west, Kevin

and the seven other Cong Crushers cautiously

made their way through the jungle in search of

some VC. They got information from a Cessna

O-1 “Bird Dog” observation airplane that ten VC

were spotted within a half-mile to the east of

them.

Kevin jumped i nside every time the sound of

a twig broke when a fellow Cong Crusher

walked on it.

The two other squads of Cong Crushers

were fifty yard away to the east.



Meanwhile, back up in the air, Crazy Jay

flew Crusher 3 east and was five miles from

Cam Rahn.



229

Michael and everybody sat back and

enjoyed the view of the coastal town.



Five minutes later, Crazy Jay received

permission to land at Cam Rahn and touched

Crusher 3 down on the tarmac. He shut down

the engine and the blades started slowing down.

Michael got out of Crusher 3 with his flight

helmet in hand.

He spotted a new Huey nearby, and his

mouth started watering at the sight of it.

Bruce and Chaz got out of Crusher 3 with

their flight helmets in hand. They glanced over

at their new Huey.

“She‟s sure pretty,” Chaz said with his

Alabama twang.

Michael, Crazy Jay and everybody walked

over to the Operations building.



Fifteen minutes later, Michael, Bruce, and

Chaz walked out of the Operations building with

new guys, PFC George Carrie, and PVT Elmer

Johnson and PVT Jeff Earnhardt.

Crazy Jay, and his crew walked out of the

Operations building behind Michael and his

gang.



230

“We‟l meet you back a Lola,” Crazy Jay told

Michael while they headed over to a Jeep Kaiser

M715 pickup truck parked by the building.

“Okay,” Michael replied while he and his

crew headed to his new Huey.

Michael, Bruce, and Chaz walked around

and checked out the shiny new Huey.

New Cong Crushers George, Elmer, and

Jeff waited with their duffle bags in hand.

Michael walked over and opened up the

starboard door of the cockpit. He poked his

head inside and took a whiff. “Mmmm, don‟t you

just love that new helicopter smel ,” he said

while he looked inside the Huey‟s console.

Bruce opened up the port door of the

cockpit. He poked his head i nside and took a

whiff. “I know what you mean,” he added.

Chaz climbed up on the top and checked out

the rotor system.

Michael and Bruce got inside and sat down

in their seats behind their controls.

George, Elmer, and Jeff climbed in the

cargo area with their duffle bags.

Chaz climbed down off the top of the Huey

and got inside the cargo area.

Michael and Bruce went through the

checklist and started up their new Huey while



231

the guys in the back were getting themselves

buckled into their canvas seats.

The rotor blades of Crusher 15 started

circling around.



Meanwhile, back in the jungle, Kevin and the

other Cong Crushers stopped off for a rest. It

was quiet and they did not come across the VC

that the Bird Dog earlier spotted.

The other two squads of Cong Crushers

were also taking a rest about forty yards away.



Back at Cam Rahn, Michael received

clearance to take off from the tarmac.

He lifted the new Crusher 15 off the tarmac

and ascended off into the sky heading west.



It was a quiet ride back to LZ Lola for

Michael while he flew two thousand feet above

the Vietnam countryside.



Back in the jungle, Kevin and his squad of

Cong Crushers cautiously made their way back

through vegetation. They headed to the LZ

Scorpion to be picked up by a Huey. Their

mission was deemed a bust since the VC could

not be located.



232

The other two squads of Cong Crushers

were fifteen yards away and heading to the

same LZ to be picked up by Hueys.



Later that day back inside the new Crusher

15, Michael received clearance to land at LZ

Lola on the radio from Calvin.

Crushers 7, 8, and 9 took off while Crusher

15 was descending down to the LZ.

Crushers 7, 8, and 9 banked and headed

west when they were two hundred feet up in the

air.

Michael landed Crusher 15 down by one of

the revetments in the first available spot.



Back in the jungle, Kevin and his squad of

Cong Crushers arrived at the LZ Scorpion

clearing. They waited in the vegetation.

The other two squads of Cong Crushers

were waiting close by in other vegetation.



Back at LZ Lola, Michael shut down his

Huey and the blades started slowing down.

Michael, Bruce, Chaz, and the three new

guys hopped out of the helicopter.

“I need to find Marty so he can paint our

chopper. Take the new guys to meet Colonel



233

Harrington,” Michael told Bruce and Chaz then

headed off into another direction of LZ Lola.

Bruce and Chaz headed off toward the

Operations tent with George, Elmer, and Jeff.



Fifteen minutes later, Michael found Marty

and paid him the standard fee for painting his

nose art on his new Huey.



Back in the jungle, one of the Cong

Crushers set off some red smoke to mark the LZ

Scorpion for the Huey‟s racing toward them at

tree top level.



Back at LZ Lola, Michael watched while

Marty painted on the final area of the nose art

for Crusher 15.

“Nice job,” Michael told Marty while he

collected up his paint brushes and paint.

Marty walked away with a smile over being

$40 richer.



Back in the air, Kevin sat with his Cong

Crushers squad in the cargo area of Crusher 8.

All he could think about was taking a shower

and sleeping for twelve hours.





234

Back at LZ Lola, Michael relaxed on his

bunk in the Lola Hilton.

His eyes widened with joy when he saw Kim

enter the tent with a broom in hand.

She saw Michael on his bunk and gave him

a smile.

She started sweeping the floor and moved

down toward Michael‟s bunk.

Michael waited until Kim swept her way

down to his bunk.

“Can I see you later tonight?” he asked while

he grabbed and held one of her hands.

Kim nodded with a smile that she‟ll meet him

later.

“Eight at party place two. I want you to meet

an old friend of mine. Then I‟l show you my

new Huey. It‟s Crusher fifteen,” he replied.

“Eight,” she responded with a smile and

return to sweeping the floor.

Michael then heard the faint sounds of the

three Huey‟s returning with the Cong Crushers.

He got up of his bunk and rushed to the

door.

Kim stopped sweeping down the mail aisle

and watched while Michael left the tent.



235

She looked around and eyed a locker where

owner got absent minded and forgot to lock it.

She started sweeping toward that locker.

Bruce lay in his bunk down a little way down

from the opened locker. He coughed and

caught Kim‟s attention.

She returned to sweeping the floor down the

main aisle.



Michael rushed through LZ Lola and headed

to where the Helicopters were parked.

The sounds of the three Huey‟s approaching

the LZ got louder.

Michael arrived at one of the revetment

walls and saw LTC Harrington and Sarge walk

over to Crusher 1 with Filson and Frank. SP4

Jason Sheen tagged along behind with SSG

Billy Eastwood who was dressed in his khaki

uniform. Billy had his duffel bag in hand and a

huge smile on his face. His tour in Nam was

finally over and he was going home in one

piece.

Crusher‟s 7, 8, and 9 landed in some

opened spaces.

LTC Harrington, Billy, and Jason got in the

cargo area of Crusher 1 while Filson and Frank

got in their seats in the cockpit.



236

The pilots of Crushers 7, 8, and 9 shut down

their engines while Filson started up Crusher 1.

Michael stood by one of the revetment walls

and watched while the Cong Crushers jumped

out of the three Hueys. The Cong Crushers

looked dog-tired and were filthy from their two-

day trek in the jungle.

Michael looked for Kevin and silently prayed

he was still alive. His eyes lit up and he sighed

a sigh of relief the second he spotted Kevin

amongst his squad. “Kevin!” he yelled out.

Kevin did not show any emotions while he

glanced over at Michael.

Michael waited until Kevin‟s squad walked

near by.

“Kevin,” Michael cal ed out while he rushed

over to his buddy.

“Hey,” Kevin replied with a quiet tone and

stopped by Michael.

“Let‟s go get some beers,” Michael offered.

“After I visit the Soapy Palace and take a

much needed nap,” Kevin replied.

Michael could tell Kevin was completely

exhausted and became concerned. “Meet me at

eight at party place two. I want you to meet

Kim,” Michael added.



237

Kevin nodded that he would meet later and

moped away.

Michael was still concerned while he

watched Kevin mope away and headed to his

sleeping tent.

Michael walked away and headed to the

Eloquent Army Cuisine tent to get some coffee.

Crusher 1 lifted off the ground and ascended

up into the air.



A few minutes later, Crusher 1 banked

around and headed in an easterly direction for

Cam Rahn.



After some coffee and then some chow,

Michael walked around LZ Lola to kill some time.

His thoughts flipped between Kim and Kevin.



Eight o‟clock rolled around and Michael

headed to Party Place Two.

He sat down at a table and waited.

Kim entered Party Place Two and Michael‟s

eyes lit up.

He stood up and pulled out her chair while

she walked over to him. After a quick kiss on

her lips, she sat down.



238

“My good buddy Kevin from back home wil

be here shortly. I can‟t wait for you to meet

him,” he said while he sat down.

Kim gave Michael a quaint smile.

Michael looked at the tent door for signs of

Kevin. He was not there.

“I‟l get us some beers,” Michael said while

he stood up.

Kim watched while Michael walked over to

the bar table.

Kevin walked into Party Place Two

showered and wearing fresh fatigues and looked

refreshed.

“Kevin,” Michael cal ed out the second he

spotted him.

Kevin walked over to the bar.

“Three beers my man,” Michael told Hao.

Hao nodded that he understood then walked

away to get the beers.

Kevin walked up to Michael while Hao

placed three opened cans of Miller beer on the

bar.

Michael paid for the beers then he headed

back to his table with Kevin.

Michael placed a can of beer in front of Kim.

“Kim, meet Kevin Coogan, my best friend

from back home in Glendale. Kevin, meet Kim



239

Ly, the love of my life,” Michael said while he sat

down by Kim‟s right.

The second Kim and Kevin‟s eyes met, they

knew they did not like each other. It was

something about his carrot top head that she

despised.

“It‟s a pleasure to meet you,” Kevin said

while he pretended to like her and sat down

across the table from her.

Kim faked a smile to indicate it was a

pleasure to meet him. She took a few sips of

beer and felt uncomfortable with sitting across

from Kevin.

Kim glanced over at the bar table and saw

Hao while he chatted with a Sergeant that was a

little drunk. Hao glanced at Kim and gave her a

little discreet nod then listened to the drunk

Sergeant brag about tomorrow‟s mission.

Kevin took a drink of beer and also felt

uncomfortable with sitting at the same table with

Kim. But he did not have the heart to tell

Michael that there was something about Kim he

despised.

Michael was clueless and was happy that

two of the most important people in his life were

with him at this moment.



240

Hao walked away from the bar table when

Keith came over to act as the bartender for the

rest of the night.

Hao rushed out of the tent.

Kim looked at Michael. “I go home now,”

she said, as she could not stand being near

Kevin any longer.

“Why? Kevin just got here?” Michael said

while he grabbed Kim‟s hand and held it.

“Me feel sick,” Kim said then leaned down

and kissed Michael on his cheek. She rushed

up from her chair.

Michael looked a little baffled while he

watched Kim rushed off to the door of the tent.

Kevin was happy that Kim was gone, as he

did not trust any Vietnamese because of his time

in the jungle.

“I‟m so sorry. That‟s not like her to run off

like that,” Michael said while he watched Kim

rush out the tent door.

“When I was out in the jungle, I had to shoot

a VC. He had to be around sixteen years old.

There was a female VC along with him. She

shot at me and missed. I swore she had a M-16

in her hands. I tried to shoot back at her, but

she took off like a jack rabbit,” Kevin told

Michael then took a large gulp of his beer.



241

Michael looked at Kevin and saw how

scared he was in his eyes.

“I hate this fucking place. I just arrived, and

I don‟t know if I‟m going to be able to handle it,”

Kevin said while he gulped down the rest of his

beer. “The next round is on me,” Kevin said

then shot up and walked to the bar table.

Michael was a little speechless and did not

know how to react to Kevin‟s comment.

Kevin walked back to the table with two

beers in hand.

“Let‟s take a walk,” Michael told him the

second Kevin placed the two cans of beer on the

table.

“Why?” Kevin asked while he sat down and

took a big gulp of beer.

“I want to show you my new Huey,” Michael

replied.

Kevin looked at Michael. “Sure, why not,” he

said then grabbed his can of beer.

Michael grabbed his can of beer and stood

up.

It was quiet between them while they walked

to the tent door.





242

While Michael and Kevin exited Party Place

Two, Kim and Hao snuck out of the supply tent

then headed to the front gate of the LZ.



It was quiet between Michael and Kevin

while they walked through the LZ and headed to

Crusher 15.

Once they got to the Huey, Michael opened

up the port side cargo door and they sat in the

cargo area.

“I‟m serious Michael. I don‟t think I can

make it during another mission,” Kevin said and

looked really scared.

“I don‟t know what to say. I know it‟s

dangerous out there, but you have to take it one

day at a time. I mean, you can‟t turn in your

letter of resignation with the Uncle Sam‟s Army.”

Kevin thought about Michael‟s comment. “I

wonder how far Thailand is from here? Do you

think I make it back there?” Kevin asked and

looked serious.

“AWOL is a serious offense. You‟l get

caught eventually. So put that out stupid idea of

your mind,” Michael replied in a scolding tone.

Kevin thought about Michael‟s comment for

a few seconds. “I guess you‟re right,” he replied

then took a large gulp of beer. “Oh, about Kim,



243

there‟s something odd about her. Something

odd that I don‟t like,” he added and looked

serious.

Michael opened his mouth to reply but shut

it when he heard someone walk up to the Huey.

“Coogan, go get some rest, I just got word

that we‟re going on another mission tomorrow,”

Brian, Kevin‟s squad leader, said while he

walked up to Crusher 15.

Kevin looked at Brian with eyes that he was

not going to obey.

“Get some sleep Coogan, you‟l fucking

need it,” Brian said and looked serious when he

sensed Kevin was not going to obey.

“You better go,” Michael told Kevin.

Kevin nodded in agreement and got out of

Crusher 15.

Michael was concerned for Kevin while he

watched him walk away with Brian.

Michael hopped out of the cargo area and

closed the cargo door.

He headed back to Lola Hilton to also call it

a night.



244





Chapter 18


Throughout the whole humid night, Kevin

tossed and turned in his bunk while the thoughts

of his next mission weighted heavily on his mind.

Michael also tossed and turned in his sleep,

as thoughts about Kevin filled his mind.

Would really he go AWOL? That was the

question that ran over and over in Michael‟s

mind while he tossed and turned in his bunk.



The sun rose for the start of another day in

the war. Today‟s temperature high would be a

tad cooler at 85 deg F.

Michael along with everybody else woke up

and shaved and showered.

After some of the Army‟s fine breakfast

cuisine, Michael went back to the Lola Hilton

and got dressed in his flight suit.

He headed off to the Operations tent to get

the scoop about today‟s mission.



Twenty minutes later, Michael learned that

his Huey along with three other Hueys would

drop off four squads of Cong Crushers for a



245

mission to attack a VC camp detected by the

observation Bird Dog airplanes.



Michael started to head off to Crusher 15 but

he stopped dead in his tracks the second he

saw Kim walking toward the tents with a broom

in hand.

He bolted after her.

“Kim,” he cal ed out when he was fifteen feet

behind her.

Kim turned around and smiled at the sight of

Michael. “Hi,” she said with a loving smile.

“Hey beautiful,” Michael said then gave her

a quick kiss on the lips.

“You go on mission?” she said when she

saw his flight helmet in his right hand.

“Yeah, in a few minutes,” Michael replied but

wished he could stay here with her.

“Where?” she asked and looked worried and

reached out and held his left hand. “Me scared

for you,” she said and looked sincere.

Michael looked around and nobody was

within hearing distance. “About ten miles east of

Kil Kout. We got word from military intelligence

that some VC made camp there,” he replied

feeling he could trust her.



246

Kim was in deep thought while she thought

about Michael‟s response.

“Where you pick them up? I pray you be

safe there,” she said and had a concerned look

in her eyes.

“Landing zone Walrus, which is about fifteen

miles east of Kil Kout,” Michael replied.

“Me better to clean tents now. They dirty,”

she said and appeared to have something else

on her mind.

“I gotta go also,” he said while he saw some

Cong Crushers heading to the Hueys with their

M-16s. He gave her a quick kiss on her lips

then bolted off to the Hueys.

Kim looked around then dropped her broom

when Michael was out of view.

She rushed off toward the front gate of LZ

Lola.



Michael rushed up to Crusher 15 where

Chaz and Bruce waited inside.

“Where did you go?” Bruce curiously asked

while Michael got in his seat behind the controls

then buckled his harness.

“I had to see someone,” Michael replied with

a smile.



247

“I‟m sorry, but I really don‟t trust her,” Bruce

said while he started to configure the Huey for

starting up the engine.

“You wil once you get to know her. She‟s a

sweetheart,” Michael said while he watched

Kevin and his squad of Cong Crushers walk

over to Crusher 7 that just started its engine.

Bruce did not reply since he probably would

never trust Kim.

While the engine of Crusher 15 started up, a

squad of Cong Crushers walked over and got

inside the cargo area equipped for their mission.

Michael saw Kevin get in the cargo area of

Crusher 7 and worried about his friend.



Five minutes later, Crushers 7, 8, 9, and 15

lifted up off the ground and ascended into the

air.

While the four Hueys banked to headed to

the northwest, Michael did not notice Kim who

raced her bicycle down the dirt road below.

Crusher 1 descended down to LZ Lola with

Harrington returning from his meeting at Cam

Rahn.

The blades of Crusher 1 whined down while

Crushers 7, 8, 9, and 15 flew off to drop the

Cong Crushers off in the jungle.



248

Harrington got out of Crusher 1.

Harrington rushed away and headed to the

MP tent.



Five minutes later, Crusher 15 flew in

formation a thousand feet above the ground with

Crushers 7, 8, and 9.

Michael glanced over at Crusher 7 that was

down to his left. He tried to see Kevin but could

not tell since they all started to look alike in their

green fatigues.



After twenty minutes of flying one thousand

feet above the Vietnam countryside, it was time

to descend down to LZ Python.

All the Cong Crushers had their M-16s ready

for some action.

Some silently prayed for a safe return while

some of them tried to soothe their nervous

stomachs.

The Crushers descended closer to LZ

Python.

“Crusher seven coming in,” Timmy said from

the radio.

Michael watched while Crusher 7 landed

and eight Cong Crushers including Kevin

jumped out.



249

Kevin and his fellow Cong Crushers ran to

the jungle.

“Crusher seven taking off,” Timmy said from

the radio.

“Crusher eight coming in,” Chris said from

the radio.

Michael watched while Crusher 8 started

descending down to the LZ and Kevin and his

fellow Cong Crushers already disappeared into

the jungle.

He then saw Crusher 7 ascend up into the

air while Crusher 8 touched down on the ground.

The squad of Cong Crushers jumped out of

Crusher 8 and ran to the jungle.

“Crusher eight taking off,” Chris said from

the radio.

“Crusher nine coming in,” Butch said from

the radio.

The second the skids of Crusher 9 touched

the ground, the Cong Crushers jumped out of

the Huey and ran to the jungle.

“Crusher fifteen coming in,” Michael said into

the radio.

“Okay guys, who are we?” yel ed the leader

of this squad yelled out from the cargo area of

Crusher 15.



250

“Cong Crushers,” the rest of squad yelled

out then stomped on the floor of the cargo area

in unison.

“Crusher nine taking off,” Butch said from

the radio.

The squad of Cong Crushers jumped out of

Michael‟s Huey the second the skids touched

the ground.

Michael looked around the area and it was

quiet.

“Crusher fifteen taking off,” Michael said into

the radio the second he knew his Cong

Crushers were safely away from his blades.

Michael lifted his Huey off the ground and

ascended to join the other three Hueys.



Five minutes later, Crushers 7, 8, 9, and 15

were back in formation flying sixteen hundred

feet above the quiet Vietnam countryside and

headed back to LZ Lola.

During the trip home, all Michael could think

about was Kevin. But he knew he would be in

the loving arms of Kim later today, so that made

him feel better.



Twenty minutes later, Crushers 7, 8, 9, and

15 landed back at LZ Lola.



251

After Michael shut down his Huey and the

blades slowed down, he jumped out of Crusher

15 and rushed back to the Lola Hilton.



After Michael changed into a fresh pair of

fatigues, he rushed out of the Lola Hilton.



Michael rushed around LZ Lola in search of

Kim.

“Michael, Colonel Harrington wants

everybody over by the Hueys,” Bruce called out

from behind Michael.

Michael turned around. “What?”

“Colonel Harrington is having some big pow

wow with everybody,” Bruce replied while he

walked over to Michael.

“What‟s going on?”

“Al I know is heard is that it has to do

something with his meeting in Cam Rahn,”

Bruce responded.

Michael really wanted to find Kim but knew

he better show up for Harrington‟s meeting.

Bruce and Michael walked along with some

other pilots and headed to the parked Hueys.

They walked over and waited by Crusher 15.



A few minutes later, a Jeep drove up with



252

Sarge behind the wheel and Harrington in the

passenger seat. Sarge had a Camel dangling

out of his mouth while Harrington puffed on a

cigar.

Sarge stopped the Jeep by the entrance to

the parked Hueys where everybody in the LZ

waited. He turned off the Jeep‟s engine.

Harrington stood up and faced his troops.

He puffed on his cigar then exhaled.

“Thank you for coming and sorry for the

short notice,” he said then hesitated for a few

seconds while he pondered his speech and

puffed on his cigar. “I had a briefing at Cam

Rahn and other Commanders have been

reporting similar problems like what we‟ve been

having here a Lola. There have been reports of

weapons, munitions, and radios going missing at

the other landing zones. Landing Zone Echo

caught a Vietnamese that worked as a barber

stealing a M-16. After interrogation, it was

determined that the barber was VC. Therefore, I

had all Vietnamese citizens escorted off Lola

never to return. We cannot take a chance that

one of them could be VC. That‟s all,” said

Harrington then he sat down in the cargo seat of

the Jeep and puffed on his cigar.

Sarge started up the Jeep and drove off



253

leaving a trail of cigar smoke behind.

The crowd around the Hueys started to

disperse and leave the area. They could care

less if the Vietnamese civilians were kicked out

of Lola.

“I didn‟t trust those fucking gooks being

around here,” a Sergeant told his Staff Sergeant

buddy while they walked past Michael‟s Huey.

“Is that al ? I thought we were going to have

some type of massive battle in a day or two,”

Bruce told Michael.

“Yeah, massive battle,” Michael said in

disbelief that Kim was no longer allowed in LZ

Lola.

Michael moped away from the parked Hueys

and could not bear the thought of not seeing the

girl he loved.

Michael sulked while he moped back to Lola

Hilton.



Meanwhile, Kevin and his squad of Cong

Crushers cautiously made their way through the

jungle. The other three squads were nearby all

headed in the same direction.



Eight miles away, twenty-five VC cautiously

made their way through the jungle headed



254

toward the Cong Crushers. Six of those VC

were young girls all itching to kill some more

American soldiers.



The rest of the day and evening was quiet in

LZ Lola. Michael spent most of the night getting

drunk to help cope with the thought that he

might never see Kim again.



It was 10:00 p.m., and Michael staggered

out of Party Place Two drunk off the eight beers

he bought.

He staggered over to Shitter Way take a

piss.

The second he walked into Shitter 2, he

buckled over and vomited all over the wooden

toilet seat.



Back in the jungle, Kevin and the Cong

Crushers were nestled between some

vegetation to get some much needed sleep.

Kevin had first watch and was relieved that

the first day out in their mission was q uiet. But

the noises of all the Vietnam nighttime critters

still made him jump inside thinking the VC was

out there. Somewhere.

It started raining and the Cong Crushers



255

were soon soaked to the bones in a matter of

minutes.



Four miles away, the rain just stopped and

the VC decided to camp for a few hours of

sleep.



Back in LZ Lola, Michael plopped down on

his bunk. He was really going to hate the

morning.

It started raining.



256





Chapter 19


The morning sun rose for the start of

another day. For some of the Cong Crushers, it

meant they were closer to going back home.

For some others, it they were only a tad closer

to going home. Michael still had six months to

go and that felt like an eternity.



Everybody slowly rose out of their bunks

and headed to the Soapy Palace.

After Michael took his shower and dressed

in two-day old fatigues, he headed off to the

Eloquent Army Cuisine tent.



After some breakfast of powered eggs,

coffee, and toast, Michael headed over to

Crusher 15.

He spent all morning assisting Chaz while

he did some little preventive maintenance on the

Huey. He had to do something to keep his mind

of not being able to see Kim again. But while he

helped Chaz, he tried to figure out a way he

could sneak out of LZ Lola and see Kim at her

village.



257



Way off in the jungle, Kevin and his squad of

Cong Crushers inched their way through the

thick jungle swatting off the bugs while they

were getting closer to the VC camp.



Back at LZ Lola, Michael finished helping

Chaz do that preventive maintenance on

Crusher 15.



An hour later, Crusher 15 was ready for their

next mission. But Michael was still bored and

headed to see Harrington.



Michael entered The Boss‟ Tent and saw

Sarge drinking his sixth cup of coffee while he

reviewed some paperwork. Michael looked

down at the top of Sarge‟s desk and saw that

ashtray filled with Camel butts.

“Sarge, can I see Colonel Harrington for few

seconds?” Michael asked.

“What for?” Sarge asked then took another

sip of coffee.

“I‟m bored out of my mind. I was wondering

if he needed a supply run over to Nha Trang?”

Michael replied.



258

Sarge looked at his coffee cup. “We are

running low on coffee,” he said while he glanced

over at the coffee pot where the Maxwell House

coffee can was almost empty.

Sarge got up from behind his desk and

headed to Harrington‟s door.

He knocked on the door.

“Enter,” Harrington called out from his office.

Sarge cracked opened the door and stuck

his head inside. “Grayson‟s bored and wants to

know if you want a supply run to Nha Trang?

We are in a need for coffee and Marty is ready

to head home,” Sarge said with his head in

Harrington‟s office.

“Okay. Make a list and make sure he gets

some beer and I need some more cigars. I can

imagine that those Cong Crushers will be

parched after they return from their mission,”

Harrington called out from his office.

Michael smiled, as he could not wait to get

away from here for a couple of hours.

Sarge walked back to his desk and grabbed

a piece of paper. He opened up a notebook

where he kept inventory of the supplies for LZ

Lola. He jotted down some items with coffee

and beer on the top of the list.



259

“Marty got his orders to go home. I‟ll round

him up and you can drop him off at Nha Trang,”

he said while he handed Michael the list.

“Thanks Sarge,” Michael said while he

grabbed the list.

Sarge returned to his paperwork while

Michael left the tent.



Michael rushed back to the Lola Hilton

where Bruce relaxed. He went inside the tent.



Bruce lay on his bunk and his eyelids started

to close. He could not wait to take a little

snooze.

“Bruce,” he called out when the walked

through the tent and saw Bruce relaxing on his

bunk.

Bruce opened up his eyes and glanced up at

Michael. “I‟m trying to get some shut eye,”

Bruce said then closed his eyes.

“We‟re going on a supply run to Nha Trang.”

“Now?”

“Yeah, now.”

“Crap,” Bruce said while he got up from his

bunk.

“It‟s part of your flight training,” Michael

replied.



260

“Okay,” Bruce said while he sat up.

“I‟l go get Chaz, get changed, and meet ya

at the chopper,” Michael said then walked away

from Bruce‟s bunk.

“Okay,” Bruce said while he got up off his

bunk and started dressing in his flight suit.



Michael searched Chaz and found him

tossing around a football with four other soldiers.

Chaz headed off to his tent called “The Crap

Pit” while Michael headed back to Lola Hilton

and got changed into his flight suit.



Ten minutes later, Chaz was in position in

the cargo area of Crusher 15 while Bruce and

Michael started up the engine.

Marty was dressed in his khaki uniform and

had his duffel bag in hand while he strutted over

to Crusher 15. He had a huge grin on his face

so happy that he was also going home in one

piece.

The blades of Crusher 15 started slicing

through the air.



Five minutes, Bruce lifted Crusher 15 off the

ground.





261

While Bruce ascended Crusher 15 off the

ground, Michael saw the village where Kim lived

about four miles to the north of LZ Lola.

“Turn to a heading of northwest,” Michael

told Bruce.

Bruce‟s eyebrows furrowed when he heard

that, as he knew Nha Trang was a little more of

a northeasterly direction. “Are you sure?”

“I‟m sure,” Michael replied and sounded

serious.

Bruce turned Crusher 15 and headed north.

Michael looked out the window and saw the

village coming up.

“Head to the right of that village and keep it

at five hundred,” Michael.

“Got it,” Bruce replied and obeyed Michael‟s

orders and turned the Huey to the northwest.

While Crusher 15 flew by the village,

Michael craned his neck to look out his door

window in hopes of spotting Kim. He could not

spot her and was disappointed. He did see

some Cong Crushers that made their routine

security check of the village for any signs of VC.

“Looking for Kim?” Bruce asked when he

figured it out.



262

“Yeah, but I can‟t see her down there,”

Michael relied and stopped looking down at the

village.

“Want me to circle around?” Bruce asked.

“Nah,” Michael replied then his eyes

widened when he saw what appeared to be a

young Vietnamese woman riding the bike on a

dirt road down below. He glanced past the girl

and saw a field ahead of her. “Land down in

that field,” Michael ordered Bruce.

“Why?” Bruce replied and was concerned.

“Consider it part of your training,” Michael

replied while he kept an eye on the girl on the

bike.

“What ever,” Bruce replied while he

descended the Huey down to the field.

“What the fuck are you doing?” Chaz

replied.

“I would like to get out of this place alive,”

Marty yelled not liking the idea of landing.

“Landing in that field,” Bruce replied.

“Why?”

“Because the boss told me to do it,” Bruce

responded.

“Fuck!” Marty yelled out.

Chaz glanced out the Huey and saw the

Vietnamese girl riding on the bike down the dirt



263

road. He instantly knew what Michael was up to

with that Vietnamese girl. He rolled his eyes

while he kept a vigil out for possible VC.

Bruce landed Crusher 15 in the field.

The engine idled and the blades slowed

down.

Michael quickly unbuckled his harness,

opened his door then rushed out of the Huey.



Michael ran through the field and headed to

the dirt road.

He ran down the dirt road and headed to the

Vietnamese girl on the bicycle.

The girl stopped her bike and looked scared

when she saw Michael running at her.

“Kim,” Michael yelled out while he ran at the

girl.

Michael was all excited but looked sad the

second he noticed this girl was not Kim.

“Where‟s Kim?” Michael asked the girl.

The girl got intimidated with Michael‟s

sudden presence.

“Where‟s Kim Ly? She‟s my girlfriend,”

Michael repeated.

“Me don‟t know Kim Ly,” the girl replied and

sounded positive.



264

“Doesn‟t Kim Ly live in your vil age?”

Michael said while he pointed back down the

road at the village.

“Me never see a Kim Ly in my village,” the

girl replied and looked sincere but was still

intimidated by Michael.

Michael looked confused. “Are you sure?”

The girl shook her head in agreement.

Michael turned around and moped back to

the Huey.

He did not know that to think about Kim‟s

whereabouts or the vil age girl‟s claim that she

never met Kim.

Michael got back inside Crusher 15.



“Let‟s head to Nha Trang,” Michael told

Bruce while he buckled his harness after sitting

in his seat.

“Okay boss,” Bruce said while he revved up

the engine and the blades started spinning

around faster.



A few minutes later, Bruce lifted Crusher 15

off the ground and ascended up into the air.

“Turn to a heading of zero two zero and

level off at two thousand,” Michael instructed.



265

“Zero two zero and level off at two

thousand,” Bruce replied.



It was a quiet ride to Nha Trang and Michael

could not get the thoughts of Kim‟s whereabouts

out of his mind.



Meanwhile, fifty miles to the west in the thick

jungle, Kevin and his squad was cautiously

making their way to the suspected VC village.



Thirty minutes later, Crusher 15 was getting

closer to Nha Trang and the Song Cai River was

visible up ahead.

“That‟s the Song Cai River up ahead.

Fol ow it toward the east,” Michael told Bruce.

“Okay,” Bruce replied while he headed the

Huey to the river.



A few minutes later, Bruce banked Crusher

15 per Michael‟s orders when the Huey got to

the Song Cai River.

He flew the Huey in an easterly direction.

A little while later, Michael pointed at the one

o‟clock position. “There‟s Nha Trang,” he said.

Bruce looked in the direction Michael

pointed and he Nha Trang way off in the distant.



266

Bruce turned Crusher 15 a little to the right

and Nha Trang was straight ahead.

He started a slow descent to the

Vietnamese city.



A little while later, Michael glanced out his

door window and saw the beach and the

beautiful South China Sea. It reminded him of

home back in California and could not wait to

return there.

Marty was so happy and knew it would not

be long before he was back home in New York

City.

“The base is up ahead,” Michael told Bruce.

Michael saw Nha Trang Air Base straight

ahead.

After Michael established radio contact with

the air base and received permission to land,

Bruce started a slow descent.



Ten minutes later, Bruce had Crusher 15

landed on the tarmac and shut down the engine.

Michael, Bruce, Chaz, and Marty got out of

the Huey.

“Wel Marty, have a safe trip back to the

states,” Michael said while he extended out his

hand.



267

“Thanks,” Abbot replied while he shook

Michael hand.

“We‟re going to have a hard time finding a

cartoonist like you. And like we talked, maybe

my dad can get you a job. You can have a great

career as animator,” Michael said.

“I wil ,” Marty said then he shook Bruce and

then Chaz‟s hands.

Michael, Bruce, and Chaz watched while

Abbott strutted off with his duffel bag in hand.

“Wel , let‟s go get some supplies,” Michael

told his two crew members.

They walked over toward the Operations

buildings.



Back in the jungle, Kevin and the other

squads of Cong Crushers stopped and made

camp two miles from the VC village. They

planned on attacking the village at 0500

hopefully before the VC woke up.



Two hours later, Crusher 15 was loaded with

cases of beer, and other needed supplies.

Bruce lifted the Huey off the tarmac and

ascended off into the sky.





268

Back in the jungle, Kevin relaxed with the

other Cong Crushers in their camp.

Some started to doze off.

Some smoked their cigarettes.

Some played a little poker.

Some just relaxed and silently praying they

would not get killed tomorrow.



Later that day, Bruce landed Crusher 15

back at LZ Lola.

After the Huey was unloaded with the

supplies, Michael headed back to Lola Hilton to

rest. But his mind was filled with thoughts of the

whereabouts of Kim.



Back in the jungle, Kevin was on guard duty

along with four other Cong Crushers from the

other squads. He silently prayed that the VC

would not try to attack them tonight while he

scanned the area.



The sun fell below the horizon bringing

another night in Vietnam.



Back in the jungle, Kevin was asleep with

the other Cong Crushers except for four who

guarded the area for VC.



269



Back in the Lola Hilton, Michael lay in his

bunk and couldn‟t get Kim out of his mind.



270





Chapter 20


It was 0400 in the morning. The jungle was

quiet except for the soft sounds of the four

squads of the Cong Crushers that were waking

up from their sleep.



During the next ten minutes, the squads of

Cong Crushers ate breakfast from their Meals,

Combat Individual (MCI) rations. Preservatives

are so yummy!



A few minutes later, the four squads of Cong

Crushers were packed, and had the area

cleaned up from any signs they were there.



The four squads of Cong Crushers started

their cautious trek through the jungle to attack

the village.

Kevin was scared to death while his squad

made its way through the thick vegetation.



It was 3:20 in the afternoon back in

Glendale, California at the Coogan home.

Kevin‟s mom Lucy just poured a cup of coffee.



271

She sat down at the kitchen table where

stationary and a pen waited. She took a sip of

coffee then set the cup down. She grabbed the

pen.

“Dear Kevin,” she wrote down on the piece

of stationary.



Over at the Grayson home, Elaine sat on the

couch in the living room drinking a cup of hot

tea. She had one of her numerous family photo

albums out and was looking at pictures of

Michael. She turned to the last page and

glanced at the photo of Michael and Eric she

took at graduation day at Fort Rucker. Her eyes

welled up knowing her baby was in the war.



Back in Vietnam at LZ Lola, Michael was

sound asleep and started a dream…



In his dream, Michael stood in the middle of

the jungle. He looked worried while he looked

around the area.

“Kim!” he yel ed out.

The only sounds that responded were jungle

animals.

“Kim!” he yel ed out again.



272

“Michael,” was the faint sound of Kim when

she replied.

“Kim!” Michael yelled out again to zero in on

her location.

“Michael!” Kim yelled out again from the

jungle.

Michael looked in the direction where her

voice came from.

He bolted in that direction.

He jumped over a downed tree trunk.

He dodged around numerous vegetation

while he bolted through the jungle.

“Kim!” he yel ed out while he ran through the

jungle.

“Michael!” Kim yelled back and the sound of

her voice was closer indicating he was heading

in the right direction.

“Kim!” he yel ed out while he hurdled over

another downed tree trunk.

“I over here!” Kim yel ed out and her voice

was closer.

Michael ran through some vegetation and

came to a clearing.

He saw Kim standing in the clearing with her

arms extended out wanting him. “Michael!” he

called out in a loving tone.



273

Michael ran to Kim and they immediately

engaged in a hug.

“I love you Kim,” he said while he hugged

her hard.

“Me love you,” Kim replied while she hugged

him hard.

Michael and Kim kissed. It turned

passionate.

Bullets suddenly danced around by their

feet.

They continued to kiss ignoring the bullets.

“Marry me Kim,” he asked while he gazed

into her soft brown eyes.

She nodded in agreement that she would be

his wife.

They kissed.

More bullets zinged around by their heads.

They continued to kiss ignoring the bullets

that zinged inches from their heads.

Then a bullet hit Michael in the middle of his

back. His eyes widened in a panic.

He looked at Kim and she looked confused

with Michael‟s panicked stare.



Back to reality, Michael shot up in his bunk

thinking he was shot in his back. He gasped for

air in a panic and looked dazed and confused.



274

Then it dawned on him that he had a dream

about Kim. He really missed her.

He looked at his watch and saw it was 0450

in the morning. He lay in his bunk and stared at

the ceiling. He tried to go back to sleep in hopes

his dream of kissing Kim would return.



Back in the jungle, the four squads of Cong

Crushers inched through the thick jungle and got

to the east side of the VC village.

The other squads of were closing in on the

village to the north, south, and west.

Kevin felt he was going to vomit while he

thought about the battle that would be starting

any second. Then gunfire echoed in the jungle

while some VC guards spotted the threatening

Americans.

Kevin and his squad of Cong Crushers dove

for cover in nearby vegetation. He shook in fear

while some bullets took out some vegetation

inches above his head. Kevin almost crapped in

his pants. He took a deep breath and started

shooting blindly in the vicinity of the village.



Back at LZ Lola, Michael finished with his

shower and got dressed in his fatigues. He

believed that today would be quiet for him.



275

So he headed off for some breakfast and

coffee at the Eloquent Army Cuisine tent.



Back in the jungle, the battle between the

Cong Crushers and the VC got fierce.

Kevin watched in horror while two members

of his squad were shot and lay in the dirt with

blank lifeless stares.

Even though numerous VC were killed, the

call came for the Cong Crushers to retreat

because the number of VC in that village was

grossly underestimated. It was another screw-

up by military intelligence.

The call was made for air support to destroy

the village.

The Cong Crushers picked up their dead

buddies and retreated away from the village.



When the Cong Crushers were safely away

from the village, the sound of two F-5 Tiger II

jets approaching were heard from the sky.

The F-5 jets got closer to the village.

The Cong Crushers soon felt the heat of the

Napalm bombs going off while the village was

being destroyed by fire.

The sounds of screaming VC was heard

while the Napalm severely burned their bodies.



276

Kevin tried to block out those horrible

screams while he ran through the jungle with the

other Cong Crushers.



Back at LZ Lola, Harrington called a surprise

briefing for Crushers 7, 8, 9, and 15 pilots and X-

Ray‟s in the Operations tent in five minutes.



Back in the jungle, Kevin and the other

squads of Cong Crushers were making their way

through the jungle. Their destination was LZ

Walrus, which was about two miles away.



Back in the Operations tent at LZ Lola,

Michael and the other air commanders got a

briefing by Harrington with Sarge standing by his

side. They were instructed to get airborne

ASAP and head to LZ Walrus to pick up the

Cong Crushers. They were also briefed that

there were casualties.

Michael got a lump in his throat and silently

prayed that Kevin was not one of the casualties.

Michael and the other pilots ran out of the

Operations tent and rushed to their Hueys.



Five minutes later, the rotors of Crushers

7,8, 9, and 15 were spinning and ready flight.



277

Crusher 7 lifted off the ground and ascended

into the sky.

Crusher 8 lifted off the ground and ascended

into the sky.

Crusher 9 lifted off the ground the ascended

into the sky.

Crusher 15 lifted off the ground and

ascended into the sky.



Back by LZ Walrus, the four squads of Cong

Crushers hid in the vegetation near the clearing.

Keith sat in the dirt with the PRC-10 radio on

his back. Brian listened to the headset. “Look

for yel ow,” he replied into the headset then

shoved it back in the Keith‟s backpack.

“Our rides are on the way,” Brian told

everybody.

That information quietly spread around from

squad to squad.



Back up in the air, Crushers 7, 8, 9, and 15

were flying in formation heading to LZ Walrus.



Michael was in command of the controls of

his Huey, as Bruce was still green in their part of

his experience. But this was part of flying in

Vietnam he hated with a passion. He was not



278

looking forward to hearing the screams of men

in pain from being shot, or watching them plop

dead bodies into his Huey.



Fifteen minutes passed and it was still quiet

in the jungle while the four squads of Cong

Crushers waited for their rides.

Jeff got up and walked over to some

vegetation to take a piss. A bullet came out of

the jungle and pierced his heart. Jeff did not

know what hit him when he dropped to the

ground and died with his penis poking out of his

zipper.

George got tired from sitting in the dirt so he

stood up and stretched. While he arched his

back, another bullet came out of the jungle and

penetrated his back. He dropped to the ground

face first stunned with what just happened.

Sergeant Bobby Kendall looked over at

George who lay in the dirt with a dazed and

confused look. “What the fuck is wrong with you

Sheldon?” he asked.

“I can‟t feel my legs,” George and was still

stunned to why he suddenly lost the feeling in

his legs. The bullet hit his spine.

Then bullets started zinging all over the

place.



279

“Shit!” Kendall yelled out.

“VC” a voice was heard from another Cong

Crusher.

The squad of Cong Crushers took cover and

started shooting in the direction of where the

bullets were coming from.

Nearby, Kevin hid behind a tree while bullets

zinged above his head.

The members of his squad were hiding and

firing their M-16s in the direction they believed

the VC were coming from.

The VC cautiously made their way to the

Cong Crushers while firing their machine guns.

Some of the VC fired M-16s.

Kevin peeked over his vegetation cover and

saw a VC coming toward him. He fired his M-16

and the VC dropped dead to the ground.



Way up in the sky, Crushers 7, 8, 9, and 15

were flying one thousand feet above the ground

in formation getting closer to LZ Walrus. The air

commanders were not aware that the LZ was

now hot.

Then the calls came across the radio and

they now knew they were flying into an

extremely hot landing zone.





280

Back at LZ Walrus, the fighting got even

fiercer. All Kevin heard was gunfire, bullets

zinging all over the place, and the occasional

screams of some of the Cong Crushers while

they were being shot.

The sounds of the four Hueys were heard

while they descended down to the yellow smoke

that marked the landing zone.

The gunfire started slowing down while the

Cong Crushers were gaining control of the area.

The gunfire stopped.

The sounds of the four Hueys were louder

while they descended to the landing zone.

Kevin stood up from his hiding place. He

looked around and saw two of his buddies that

were wounded. They would survive. Kevin

heard a twig break from someone walking in the

jungle. He looked in the direction of that sound.

His eyes widened in shock. “What the fuck is

going on?” he asked and looked scared. He

raised his M-16.

The sounds of the four Hueys were louder

while they descended to the landing zone.



Up in Crusher 15, Michael watched while

Crusher 7 touched down in the field. Five Cong

Crushers ran to Crusher 7 along with two Cong



281

Crushers who carried one of their wounded

squad members.

They were inside Crusher 7 within seconds.

“Crusher seven taking off,” Timmy said from

the radio.

“Crusher eight coming in,” Chris the aircraft

commander said from the radio.

Michael watched while Crusher 8 started

descending down to the LZ. He saw Crusher 7

ascend up into the air while Crusher 8 touched

down on the ground.

The squad of Cong Crushers ran out of the

jungle and they all appeared uninjured.

“Crusher eight taking off,” Chris said from

the radio the second all the Cong Crushers were

inside his Huey.

“Crusher nine coming in,” Butch said from

the radio.

Michael watched while Crusher 9 landed.

Then he saw five Cong Crushers ran to that

Huey with two Cong Crushers who carried a

body.

“Crusher fifteen coming in,” Michael said into

the radio.

“Crusher Nine taking off,” Butch said from

the radio the second those Cong Crushers were

inside his Huey.



282

Michael landed Crusher 15 in the field.

He watched while two Cong Crushers

carried a wounded soldier out of the jungle and

ran to his helicopter. He then saw two other

Cong Crushers carry another wounded solder

out of the jungle.

Two other Cong Crushers ran out of the

jungle. They suddenly stopped, turned around

and fired their M-16s into the jungle.

Michael heard the first wounded soldier

screaming in pain while they loaded him into

cargo area of Crusher 15. He looked back and

his eyes widened in shock when he saw it was

Kevin. “Kevin!” he cried out at his friend.

The two other Cong Crushers loaded the

other soldier into the chopper. He was dead.

They jumped inside the cargo area.

The last two Cong Crushers continued to fire

their M-16s into the jungle while they ran to

Crusher 15.

They jumped inside the cargo area of

Crusher 15.

“She!” Kevin screamed out in pain.

Chaz started firing his M-60 machine gun at

the jungle.

Michael just stared in horror at the sight of

Kevin who had a gaping hole in his chest.



283

Bullets from the jungle started penetrating

the Huey with that standard horrible penetrating

sound.

“Michael. Let‟s get the fuck out of here!”

Bruce yelled out while bullets continued to hit

the Huey.

Michael just stared at Kevin in disbelief that

his friend was shot.

Bruce grabbed the cyclic and collective

controls and lifted the Huey off the ground.

Kevin‟s screaming quieted down. He stared

back a Michael. “She, she cut off my finger,” he

screamed out in pain.

“What?” Michael replied.

Kevin just stared at Michael and did not utter

a word from his opened mouth with a blank

stare. He was dead.

“Some fucking female VC shot him then she

cut off his finger. I tried to kill the sick bitch, but

she was too quick,” Kenny called out to Michael.

“Did you get a good glimpse of her?” asked

Michael.

“By the time I got here, al I saw was her the

back of her long black hair. I shot at her, missed

and she slipped away through the thick

vegetation,” Kenny replied.



284

“Is he?” Michael asked and feared the truth.

“No way.”

Kenny felt for a pulse on Kevin‟s neck.

“He‟s gone,” he said then closed Kevin‟s eyelids.

Michael turned around and his eyes welled

up while he thought about Kevin. His best friend

since they started kindergarten together.

Bruce flew Crusher 15 in formation with the

three other Hueys. Michael just sat in a daze

and stared out the front.



Twenty minutes later, Crushers 7, 8, 9, and

15 landed back at LZ Lola.

Michael watched while they carried Kevin‟s

lifeless body out of his Huey to a waiting truck.

It felt so surreal that Kevin was dead. Michael

pinched his arm to make sure he was not have a

dream. The pinch hurt.

He looked sick and ran to the nose of his

Huey.

He dropped to his knees and vomited into

the dirt.

Bruce and Chaz knew Kevin was Michael‟s

friend from back in the states and felt sorry for

him.

They walked over and brought Michael up to

his feet.



285

“I‟m fine,” Michael said while he shrugged off

Chaz and Bruce‟s hands.

Michael walked away and moped back to

the Lola Hilton.



Michael moped into the Lola Hilton and went

straight to his bunk.

He sat down and looked stunned. “He‟s

dead,” he muttered to himself. “He‟s really

dead.”

He removed his wallet from his flight suit.

He opened it up and removed an old faded black

and white photo.

It was the photo his mom took back in the

summer of 1957. Michael sat on the clothesline

pretending to be a helicopter pilot and Kevin on

his bicycle. They recreated a scene from the

Whirlybirds TV show they watched the night

before. His eyes welled up while he looked at

the photo and remembered that day like it was

yesterday.

A few tears dropped on the photo. He wiped

the tears away and shoved the photo back in his

wallet. He lay on his bunk on his stomach. He

covered his head with his pillow. He started

crying.





286

The next day arrived and when Harrington

found out Kevin was Michael‟s friend from back

home he gave Michael five days of R&R in

Manila. He figured Michael would not be worth

a shit behind the controls of a Huey anyway.



Michael spent five days in Manila on some

R&R with four other Cong Crushers.

While those four Cong Crushers were going

to do some Intoxication and Intercourse, Michael

just wanted to drink.

So he drank heavily from bar to bar in the

seedy area of Manila. He came close to being

arrested by the MPs when he passed out drunk

in the doorway of a building. But some other

Cong Crushers picked him up in the nick of time

and carried him off to their place to sleep it off.

He woke up the morning vomiting, and spent

the whole day popping aspirin.



287





Chapter 21


Two months had passed and Michael still

survived the war. But he hated life since his

best friend was killed in action and he lost

contact with Kim the love of his life. He tried a

couple of times to sneak out of LZ Lola and

head to the nearby village in search of her. But

refrained, as he was afraid of being court-

martialed if caught in that village.



It was in the early evening and Michael

relaxed in his bunk and had a letter from his

mom in hand. It was the first letter he received

since Kevin was killed. He actually got the letter

two days ago, but was nervous about opening it.

He knew she found out about Kevin by now.

He decided to get it over and read her letter.

He opened the envelope and started to read the

letter.

“Dear Son, Your father and I just learned the

horrible news from Lucy Coogan about Kevin‟s

death over in Vietnam. She‟s been crying non-

stop for a week now. His body is expected to



288

arrive soon and your father and I will attend his

funeral.

I pray every night that you‟ll be safe and

sound over there. I hate watching the evening

news and seeing those numbers of our young

boys being killed over there. Please be safe

over there. I love you, mom,” her letter stated

with a few of the words a little unreadable

because of her teardrops that fell to the paper.

Michael folded the letter and shoved it back

in the envelope. He dropped the envelope into

his locker.

He got up off his bunk and walked out of the

Lola Hilton.



Michael headed to Party Place Two for a

few beers. He needed a few beers to calm his

nerves since he knew they were going on

another mission tomorrow morning.



Two hours later, Michael crawled into his

bunk and fell fast asleep.



An hour later, he had a dream…



In his dream, Michael landed Crusher 15

back at LZ Lola.



289

He idled the engine and the blades slowed

down.

“See you tomorrow,” Bruce said while he got

out of the chopper.

“Good night,” Chaz called out from the cargo

area.

Michael revved up the engine and the

blades spun around faster. He lifted the Huey

up into the air and flew away from LZ Lola.



Michael flew Crusher 15 over to a nearby

village.

He descended Crusher 15 down to a patch

of grass near a 12-foot by 12-foot grass hut.

He landed in the patch of grass and shut

down the engine.



He hopped out of the Huey and rushed over

to the grass hut.

“I‟m home,” he called out the second he

entered the hut.

“Michael!” Kim called out from the other side

of the small hut.

She ran over to Michael and they hugged.

They kissed.

The “What the fuck are you doing?” male

voice was heard near Michael‟s head.



290

Michael looked around the hut and did not

see anybody so he went back to kissing Kim.

Another “What the fuck are you doing?”

male voice was heard again but louder.



Back to reality in LZ Lola, Michael looked up

from kissing his pillow and saw Bruce standing

by his bunk. He was dressed in his boxer shorts

and was bare chested.

“Huh,” Michael replied and looked a little

dazed.

“You were kissing your pillow. I guess

because of a wet dream?” Bruce teased.

Michael turned red with embarrassment

when he realized his pillow was Kim from his

dream. “What ever,” Michael responded then he

sat up on his bunk then yawned.

“I‟m going to shower then get some

breakfast. I‟l meet you in the operations tent in

forty minutes,” Bruce said with a smirk then

walked away and headed over to his bunk.

While Michael stood up from his bunk, Bruce

grabbed his soap, shampoo, and towel out of his

locker. He then headed to the tent door.

Michael unlocked his locker and removed

his soap, shampoo and towel. He slipped his



291

bare feet into his Ho Chi Minh racing slicks then

headed off to the tent door.



An hour later, Michael and Bruce sat in the

Operations tent along with WO2 Andy Howard

the air commander for Crusher 16 and his X-Ray

WO1 Gavin Harris. Harrington was finishing up

his briefing and took a breather to fire up a fresh

cigar. Sarge stood by Harrington‟s side and

looked serious.

“We got reports from the Bird dogs that LZ

Cobra is cleared for landing. Intelligence

gathered information the old fashion way that

the VC built a new camp twelve miles north of

Eagle. Our Cong Crushers will seek and

destroy this new camp. We after all,” he said

then hesitated while stared to get fire in his

eyes. “Owe them some fucking payback,”

Harrington added still pissed about the deaths of

his young men.

Michael‟s mind drifted off between

daydreams of Kim and Kevin during the briefing.

“Dismissed,” Harrington called out.

Bruce, Andy, and Gavin stood up while

Harrington and Sarge rushed off to the door of

the tent.



292

Michael sat there thinking about Kim and

didn‟t realize the briefing was over.

“Time to fly,” Bruce said while he nudged

Michael‟s shoulder.

Michael snapped out of his daydream and

got up.

“I hope the Colonel‟s briefing sunk in your

head,” Bruce said.

“It did,” Michael replied but lied, as he did

not hear a word.

“Wel just in case, fol ow my lead,” Andy told

Michael, as he knew Michael day dreamt during

the entire briefing.

Bruce looked concerned about Michael

while they followed Bruce, Andy and Gavin to

the door of the tent.

“This looks like an easy mission,” Andy said

while they walked out of the tent.



Michael and Bruce walked over to Crusher

15 where Chaz was on top inspecting the rotor

system.

“Is she ready?” Michael asked Chaz.

“Yep,” Chaz said while he climbed down off

the top of the Huey and jumped down on the

ground.



293

“Here comes our crushers,” Chaz said while

he got inside Crusher 15 behind his M-60

machine gun.

Michael and Bruce looked and saw Cong

Crushers Squad 2 walking over to their Huey

carrying their M-16s.

The squad consisted of SSG Edward

“Eddie” Fain, SGT Ralph Lanza, Willie Daniels,

PFC Kirk Keeble, PVT Craig Spencer, PVT Mark

Edmonds who had the PRC-10 backpack field

radio strapped on his back, and PVT Louis

Medina. The Cong Crushers had their M-16s in

hand and Rucksacks on their backs. They were

going to use the code name “Shark” for their

radio calls.

The squad was quiet while they climbed in

the cargo area of Crusher 15.

Bruce and Michael got in their seats at their

controls.

Bruce went through the start-up procedure

of the Huey. Michael just watched.



Over at Crusher 16, Andy and Gavin were in

their seats behind their controls. Gavin started

running through the start-up procedure while

SP4 Dale Gordon got in his seat behind his M-

60 machine gun.



294

Cong Crushers Squad 4 walked over to

Crusher 16 with their M-16s in hand and

Rucksacks on their backs.

This squad consisted of SSG Glenn Kopp,

SP4 Joe Atkinson, SGT Randy Blackwell, PFC

Arnie Laughlin, PFC Nick Cole, PVT Oscar

Fagan, PVT Sam Honeycutt who had the PRC-

10 backpack field radio strapped on his back,

and PVT Chad Vaughn. They were going to use

the code name “Dragon” for the radio calls.

The squad was quiet while they climbed in

the back of Crusher 16.



A few minutes later, the rotor blades of

Crusher‟s 15 and 16 were spinning.

Gavin lifted Crusher 16 off the ground.

Crusher 16 ascended into the sky.

Bruce lifted Crusher 15 off the ground.

Crusher 15 ascended into the sky.



Inside Crusher 15, Michael glanced at the

Vietnam countryside and wondered where Kim

was now living.



295





Chapter 22


Twenty minutes had passed and Crusher‟s

15 and 16 were descending down to one

thousand feet. There were heading toward LZ

Cobra.

Some of the Cong Crushers sat in the cargo

area with their combat boots dangling out almost

touching the landing skids. They had their M-

16s ready for some action.



Inside Crusher 15 Chaz looked the area

over for any signs of VC and had his M-60

machine gun ready. The area looked peaceful.



Inside Crusher 16, Dale also looked the area

over for any signs of VC and had his M-60

machine gun ready.



Inside Crusher 15, Michael decided to snap

out of his daydreams of Kim. He looked ahead

and saw they were getting close to LZ Cobra.

“I‟l take the controls. We‟l come in a tree

top level,” Michael told Bruce.



296

“You got it boss,” Bruce replied and

removed his hands off the cyclic and collective

controls once Michael had control.

Crusher 15 started descending the same

time Crusher 16 started descending.

“The area looks quiet,” Michael said while he

scanned the area.

“I like quiet. I means we‟l live,” Bruce

replied while Michael leveled Crusher 15 off

about twenty feet above the tops of the trees.

“Crusher sixteen going in,” Andy called out

from the radio.

Michael and Bruce watched while Crusher

16 started its descend down to the clearing in

the LZ.

“Crusher fifteen going in,” Michael said into

the radio.

“Okay guys, who are we?” Eddie yelled out.

“Cong Crushers,” the rest of Squad 2 yelled

out then stomped on the floor of the cargo area

in unison.

That stomping sound startled Michael this

time because his mind drifted off to thoughts of

Kim and Kevin.



Crusher 16 landed in the field.



297

Cong Crushers Squad 4 jumped out of the

Huey and ran a safe distance from the

threatening blades.

They crouched down in the field just in case

there was VC in the jungle. It was quiet.

Crusher 16 lifted off the ground and

ascended into the sky.



Crusher 15 landed in the field.

Cong Crushers Squad 2 jumped out of

Crusher 15 and ran a safe distance from the

threatening blades.

They crouched down in the field just in case

there was VC in the jungle. It was quiet.

Crusher 15 lifted off to the ground and

ascended into the sky.



The two squads of Cong Crushers ran to the

jungle.

Then gunfire came from one end of the

jungle under the ascending path of the two

Hueys.

Black smoke poured from the engine

compartment of Crusher 16 and it started to fall

out of the sky.





298

Michael and Bruce saw the black smoke

pouring out of Crusher 16.

“Crusher sixteen. Is everything okay?”

Michael asked into the radio.

“I can‟t control her,” Andy replied from the

radio with the background sounds of alarms

blared from his console.

Then Michael and Bruce watched while

Crusher 16 took a nosedive down to the ground.

“We‟re going down! Crusher sixteen is

going down by landing zone Cobra,” Andy cried

out in a panic into the radio.

Michael and Bruce were stunned while they

watched and waited for Crusher 16 to impact the

ground. But the sound of bullets penetrating the

bottom of their Huey took their eyes off their

fallen buddies.

Chaz started firing his M-60 machine gun in

the direction he thought the VC was shooting.

Red and yellow flashing lights and alarms

went off all over the console.

“Fuck!” Michael yelled out while he glanced

at the engine gauges and noticed they were all

indicating engine trouble.

The sound of more bullets hitting the rear of

the Huey was heard.



299

Chaz suddenly stopped firing his M-60

machine gun. Michael and Bruce were too

preoccupied with the alarms from the console to

notice.

“We lost our tail rotor,” Michael yel ed out

while he fought with the contro ls when Crusher

15 started going all over the place.



Down on the ground, the two squads of

Cong Crushers were in a fierce battle swapping

bullets with the VC. So far, the Cong Crushers

were winning with killing six of the twelve VC.

Crusher 15 started spinning down to the

ground.

“May day. May day. Crusher fifteen is going

down in hot near landing zone Cobra,” Michael

cried out into the radio while the spinning ground

was getting closer and closer.



Crusher 15 spun down to the ground in

another clearing. Its nose dropped and dug in

the dirt while the blades plowed into the ground.

Dirt and grass were flung every where.

Crusher 15 flipped over with the blades

sheering off and flying away into the jungle.



300

Michael and Bruce were dazed and

confused while they hung upside down from

their seats.

The firing of M-16s was heard while the two

squads of Cong Crushers exchanged bullets

with the VC.

“Let‟s get the fuck out of here before she

blows,” Michael told Bruce.

Michael and Bruce unbuckled their harness

belts and dropped to the roof of the Huey.

The firing of guns between the Cong

Crushers and VC stopped. The jungle was

quiet. An eerie quiet.

Michael and Bruce removed their Colt 45

pistols they had tucked away in their flight suits.

They opened their doors and cautiously crawled

outside.

“Chaz,” Michael called out while he looked

around the area for VC. The coast was clear.

Chaz did not respond.

“Chaz,” Michael called out again while he

walked over to the cargo area.

He looked through the opened space and

saw Chaz still hanging upside down from his

seat. Chaz did not move. Blood d ripped from

Chaz‟s chest and made a huge puddle on the

roof of the Huey.



301

Bruce walked over to Chaz and felt for a

pulse in his neck. “He‟s gone,” he told Michael.

“I hate this fucking war,” Michael said while

he stared a Chaz‟s lifeless body hanging upside

down. “Let‟s get him down,” Michael said while

he headed over to the other side of the Huey.

Michael walked over to Bruce and they

immediately got Chaz down and placed his body

on the roof of their Huey.

The sound of a twig snapping was heard

from behind Michael and Bruce. They

cautiously turned around and saw four VC with

AK-47s aimed at them.

“Drop your weapons!” one of the VC yelled

out in Vietnamese at Michael and Bruce.

Michael and Bruce dropped their Colt 45

pistols to the ground.

“Shit,” Michael muttered under his breath

while visions of spending the rest of his life dying

in a VC prison filled his mind.

Then the sound of gunfire was heard and

Michael and Bruce almost crapped in their flight

suits thinking the VC shot them.

Then to their surprise, the four VC had blank

stares in their eyes while they dropped dead to

the ground.



302

Ten feet from behind the VC was Cong

Crushers Ralph, Willie, Craig, and Mark.

Michael and Bruce looked relieved while

they bent down and picked up their Colt 45s.

“We thought we were shot,” Michael told the

four Cong Crushers.

“We‟re glad we could help,” Willie said while

fellow Cong Crushers Eddie, Kirk, and Louis

walked over.

“We lost our crew chief,” Michael told Eddie

while he walked over to the Huey.

The sound of AK-47 gunfire twenty yards

away was heard.

Then the sound of M-16s was heard.

Squad 2 along with Michael and Bruce

cautiously looked around for more VC.

“Shark, this is Dragon,” the voice of Glenn

was heard from the field radio that still clung to

Mark‟s back.

Eddie walked over to Mark and grabbed the

handset of the radio. “Go ahead Dragon, this is

Shark,” Eddie answered into his handset.

“There are no survivors with the crash of

sixteen. I repeat, no survivors,” Glenn replied

from the radio.



303

“Understand no survivors. We have the

pilots of fifteen. They are the only two

survivors,” Eddie said into his handset.

“I‟l inform Pappa Bear,” Glenn replied from

the radio.

Eddie placed the handset back in the radio.

The smell of fuel started to fill the air.

“We better move away before she blows,”

Michael told Eddie.

Michael and Bruce rushed away from their

Huey along with Squad 2.

They ran off to a safe distance into the

jungle and waited.

“Shark, this is Dragon,” Glenn‟s voice came

over the radio.

Eddie walked back over to Mark and

grabbed the radio headset. “Go ahead

Dragon,” Eddie answered the call.

“Pappa Bear said to place the dead in spot

in the landing zone and proceed with the

mission. Bad weather is coming in for a day so

a rescue flight for the pilots is a no-go, so take

them with you on the mission,” Glenn replied

from the radio.

“Copy about the dead and proceed with

mission with pilots,” Eddie responded.



304

„We‟l meet you at the specified location later

tonight,” Glenn replied.

“Copy specified location,” Eddie replied then

shoved the headset back in the backpack.

“Okay Crushers, we‟l proceed with the

mission along with our two pilots,” Eddie told his

troops.

It took a few seconds for Eddie‟s comment

to sink in the heads of Michael and Bruce.

“What? We‟re going with you?” Bruce said

and looked nervous.

“Bad weather is coming in and expected to

last for a day, so a rescue mission is a no-go,”

Eddie replied.

“But we don‟t have any weapons,” Michael

said and also looked nervous.

Eddie thought about a solution to Michael‟s

question. Then his eyes lit up when he had an

idea. “I need Willie and Craig to drag Chaz out

to a clearing in the landing zone for pickup

tomorrow. Then take two AK-47s and some

ammo off those gooks,” he told Willie and Craig.

Willie and Craig nodded they understood

their orders and headed back to the dead VC

bodies and Crusher 15.

“I don‟t have any training for this type of

mission,” Michael told Eddie.



305

“It‟s easy. Fol ow us and kil any VC you run

across,” Eddie replied with a serious look.

Michael and Bruce looked at each other.

“Or you can stay here and wait for a ride

home and hope you don‟t get over run by VC,”

Eddie said.

“Fol ow you and kil any VC we ran across

seems easy enough,” Michael replied thinking

the alternative could be extremely hazardous.

Bruce nodded his head in agreement.

The sound of thunder was heard while a

storm was approaching from the south.

Willie and Craig had two AK-47s in hand

and eight additional ammo magazines in hand.

They walked over to Michael and Bruce.

“Here ya go Mister Grayson,” Willie said

while he handed Michael an AK-47 and four

ammo magazines.

Michael shoved the magazines in his

pockets in his flight suit.

Craig handed Bruce his AK-47 and four

ammo magazines.

Bruce shoved the magazines in his pockets

in his flight suit.

The thunder of the approaching storm was

heard again.



306

Eddie removed a map and compass from

his fatigue shirt pocket. He opened up the

compass and unfolded the map. He glanced at

the map and got a compass bearing of the

direction he needed to head.

“Okay Crushers, let‟s head out. Craig, you

have point,” Eddie called out to his squad

members and walked off in the direction they

needed to head.

Craig took the lead and headed in the

direction Eddie pointed.

The rest of the squad members followed

Eddie. Mark tagged along near Eddie since he

had the radio strapped to his back.

Michael and Bruce tagged in the middle of

the pack of Cong Crushers.



307





Chapter 23


An hour had passed and Michael and Bruce

tagged along with Squad 2 with Squad 4 close-

by in the jungle.

Michael and Bruce were soaked down to

their tee shirt and boxer shorts from sweat.

“How the hel do you guys handle being in

the jungle?” Michael asked Eddie while he

walked along his side.

“After a while, you get use to it,” Eddie

replied then removed his canteen off his belt.

“Take a few sips,” he said while he handed

Michael his canteen.

Michael took a few sips of water from the

canteen then handed it back to Eddie.

“Okay guys, share a little water with our

guests and try to conserve,” Eddie told his crew.

Ralph removed his canteen off his belt and

handed it to Bruce who walked near-by.

Bruce took a few sips of water from the

canteen. “Thanks,” he said while he handed the

canteen back to Ralph.

Eddie signaled for his squad to stop. “Let‟s

take a breather,” he told his crew.



308

Everybody sat down in the dirt.

Michael walked over and sat down next to

Eddie.

“I not sure I know how to fire this thing,”

Michael told Eddie while he held up his AK-47.

“Me neither,” Bruce said while he walked

over and sat down next to Michael.

Eddie grabbed Michael‟s AK-47 and held it.

“This is the fire selector,” he said while he

pointed to the large lever located on the right

side of the rifle. “You have the safe position all

the way up. The fully automatic position in the

center, and the semi-automatic position at the

bottom,” Eddie instructed while he moved the

lever through the three positions. “And then

here are the rear and front sights,” he added

while he pointed at them. “Aim and squeeze the

trigger and the VC is dead,” he added then

handed the rifle back to Michael.

“Seems easy enough,” Bruce said while he

looked over his AK-47.

“Let‟s move out. Willie has point,” Eddie

said while he stood up.

Michael and Bruce stood up with the rest of

the Cong Crushers.

Willie started walking away.



309

Eddie and the other Cong Crushers followed

with Michael and Bruce in the middle of the

pack.

It started raining and it was a downpour.

The Cong Crushers were soaked to their

bones in a matter of minutes.



An hour later and the rain still drenched the

jungle.

Michael and Bruce were huffing and puffing

since they were use to sitting in a helicopter

during his war.

Eddie noticed Michael and Bruce were

about to drop with exhaustion. “Let‟s take ten,”

he quietly told his squad.

All the Cong Crushers stopped and found a

place to sit their butts down. In the mud. But

that did not matter, as needed rest was rest.

Eddie handed Michael his canteen.

Michael took a few sips and handed it back.

Ralph handed Bruce his canteen.

Bruce took a few sips then handed it back.

The Cong Crushers sat in the mud and rain

and did their best to relax.



Ten minutes had passed.



310

Eddie stood up. “Let‟s move out. Kirk has

point,” he told his squad.

Kirk stood up and did not appear happy to

be on point.

Michael and Bruce stood up with the rest of

the Cong Crushers.

They followed Kirk while he walked away

through the wet and muddy jungle.



An hour had passed and the rain slowed

down to a light drizzle.

Eddie stopped the squad. As soon as they

stopped, he made radio contact with Glenn and

they were a half-a-mile to the northeast of

Squad 2.

“Let‟s eat,” Eddie told his troops while he

shoved the handset back into the radio on Mark

back.

The Cong Crushers removed their

Rucksacks off their backs, opened them up and

removed their MCI‟s.

“Mmmm, I got beefsteak tonight,” Wil ie

called out and did not look enthused with his

meal.

“I got chopped ham and eggs,” Ralph called

out.



311

Eddie opened up his MCI and it was beef in

spiced sauce.

“I got spaghetti and meatballs,” Mark called

out the second he opened up his MCI.

Michael and Bruce sat down and their

stomachs growled.

Eddie noticed. “Listen up guys, I want

everybody to give our pilots here a little of your

fine Army cuisine,” he told his troops.

Willie got up and walked over to Michael.

Craig got up and walked over to Bruce.

“Hold out your hand,” Willie told Michael.

Michael held out his right hand and Willie

dumped some of his beefsteak in Michael‟s

palm.

Bruce followed suit and Craig dumped some

boned chicken in Bruce‟s palm.

All the other Cong Crushers shared a little of

their delicious Army cuisine with Michael and

Bruce.



Ten minutes had passed and everybody ate

their evening MCI.

“Let‟s clean up and make sure we don‟t

leave any signs we were here,” Eddie while he

stood up. He shoved his empty MCI can into his

Rucksack.



312

The rest of his squad shoved their empty

MCI cans into their Rucksacks and policed the

area.

Michael and Bruce used the rainwater off of

nearby leaves to wash their hands.

The squad stood by Eddie ready to move

out.

“I‟l take point,” Eddie told his troops.

The Cong Crushers walked away through

the jungle with Michael and Bruce in the middle

of the pack.

While Michael walked with the Cong

Crushers through the jungle, he started to have

thoughts of his parents in Glendale. He really

missed them.



Back in Glendale, California, it was 4:00

a.m. and Elaine and Harry were sound asleep.

Elaine started another dream…



Elaine walked through some woods. There

were all kinds of sounds from different types of

critters. It was spooky.

The woods suddenly turned into a jungle

with dark green vegetation while she walked.

The sounds of the critters in the jungle got

louder and stranger and started to scare Elaine.



313

“Michael!” she called out.

Michael did not reply.

“Michael!” she called out again but louder.

She continued to walk through the jungle.

“Michael!” she called out.

“I‟m over here playing with Kevin,” Michael

called out from the jungle.

Elaine pushed her way through some

bushes and headed in the direction of Michael‟s

voice.

“Michael!” she called out again to make sure

she was headed in the right direction.

“I‟m here playing with Kevin,” Michael called

out and his voice was louder and closer.

Elaine pushed her way through some other

bushes and walked into a small clearing.

“Michael my son!” she cried out with joy the

second she saw Michael and Kevin sitting in the

dirt of the small clearing.

Then Elaine looked worried when she

noticed that Michael and Kevin looked different.

They had pale white skin and their lips were

blue. They looked up at Elaine with a lifeless

zombie type of stare in their eyes.

“What are you boys doing?” Elaine asked.



314

“We‟re dead,” replied Michael then he stood

up and had a gaping hole in the middle of his

chest.

“We‟re dead,” Kevin stood up and he had a

gaping hole in his stomach.

Elaine opened up her mouth to scream but

nothing came out.



Back in reality…

Elaine bolted up in bed with a scream.

Harry bolted up out of bed thinking an

intruder entered their bedroom. He jerked his

head around while he searched the room. It

was safe. He looked at Elaine who sat up in bed

and looked scared. “What happened?”

“I had a dream. A dream that Michael was

kil ed in Vietnam,” she replied while her lips

quivered and her eyes welled up.

“I‟m sure he‟s alive,” Harry replied while he

walked over and sat down next to Elaine. He

hugged her.

She silently prayed in his shoulder that

Michael was alive in Vietnam.

Harry silently prayed that Michael was still

alive.



It was 1900 hours back in Vietnam.



315

Eddie stopped his squad of Cong Crushers

in a thick area of the jungle that would be perfect

for quick nights sleep.

“Let‟s sleep here and then we‟ll head out at

oh three hundred. I want two hour guard shifts,”

Eddie told his troops.

Michael looked at the young soldiers then

looked at Eddie. “I‟l help out with one of the

guard shifts,” he said.

Bruce glanced over at Michael and for a few

seconds thought his air commander was nuts.

Then it dawned on him that this would be a nice

gesture. “Me too,” he said while he glanced

over at Eddie.

Eddie smiled that these two pilots wanted to

pull help with his squad. He walked over to

Mark and grabbed the radio headset.

“Dragon, this is Shark,” Eddie said into the

headset and waited for a response.

“Go ahead Shark, Dragon here,” Glenn

replied from the headset.

“Shark is out of the water and about three

miles from the Big Bad Wolf,” Eddie said into the

headset.

“Dragon is about two miles from the Big Bad

Wolf and the tub is drained,” Glenn replied from

the headset.



316

“Shark will be back in the water at three,”

Eddie responded into the headset.

“Dragon will fill the tub at three,” Glenn

replied from the headset then disconnected his

end of the call.

Eddie shoved the headset back in the radio

backpack.

Eddie looked over his squad while they

started to make camp for a quick nights sleep.



Two hours had passed and everybody ate

their MCI and shared some with Michael and

Bruce.

Michael and Bruce were paired with some of

the Cong Crushers for a two-hour guard shift.

Michael was paired up with Ralph for one in the

morning.

All the Cong Crushers were sound asleep

except for Kirk and Bruce who had the first

guard shift.



Hours had passed and the jungle was quiet

except for the sounds of creepy jungle critters.

Michael was sound asleep and started

dreaming…





317

Michael stood on a beach in Hawaii. He

was decked out in a tuxedo and gleamed from

ear to ear.

A preacher walked up to Michael with a bible

in hand.

Kim walked up wearing a beautiful while

wedding dress.

Michael glanced over at his beautiful bride

while she walked up and stood by his side.

The preacher looked at Michael. “Do you

Michael take Kim to be your wife?” the preacher

asked Michael.

“I do,” Michael replied.

The preacher looked at Kim. “Do you Kim

take Michael to be your husband,” he asked her.

“I do,” Kim replied.

“You may kiss your bride,” the preacher told

Michael.

The sound of hundreds of creepy jungle

critters filled the air.

Michael felt the pressure of a hand on his

shoulder. “Time to get up,” the voice cal ed out

from the sky.

Michael leaned forward to kiss Kim.

“Time to get up, Mister,” the voice called out

again from the sky again and shook Michael

away from Kim.



318

Michael looked at Kim and she disappeared

while Michael was kissing the air.

He looked at the preacher and he

disappeared while Michael was kissing the air.

The invisible hand shook Michael and the

beautiful Pacific Ocean and Hawaiian beach

disappeared and was suddenly filled with jungle.

Ralph‟s face suddenly glared down at

Michael from the sky. “Guard duty,” his voice

echoed down from the sky.



Back to reality…

“Guard duty,” Ralph said while he glanced

down at Michael while he lay on the ground.

Michael looked a little dazed and confused

for a few seconds while he stared up a Ralph. It

dawned on Michael that he was still in Vietnam.

“Yeah, right. Guard duty,” Michael said while he

stood up and stretched.

“By the way, why were you kissing the air?”

Ralph asked with a smirk.

Michael‟s face flushed with embarrassment

when he remembered. “A dream.”

“I‟ve had some of those types before. They

can be a bit messy in your shorts,” Ralph replied

with a chuckle while he picked his M-16 off the



319

ground. “But I prefer the real McCoy,” he added

with a grin then walked away.

Michael picked up his AK-47 off the ground.

“Okay, all you need to do is scan the jungle

for any sights or sounds of VC,” Ralph told

Michael while he started scanning the near-by

vegetation.

“Okay,” Michael replied while he started

scanning the jungle but thoughts ran back to his

dream of marrying Kim on the beach.

Then the sounds of the jungle critters started

to spook Michael thinking the VC was near-by.

They weren‟t.



320





Chapter 24


Three o‟clock in the morning rolled around

and Eddie started to quietly wake up his squad.

“Let‟s quickly eat and be out of here in

twenty,” he told everybody.

After everybody woke up, stretched, then

relieved themselves on the vegetation.

They then sat down and opened up their

MCI cans. And of course they shared some of

their canned breakfast with Michael and Bruce.



Ten minutes had passed and everybody

finished breakfast.

“Let‟s clean up and head out of here,” Eddie

said while he walked over to the radio backpack.

The Cong Crushers got up and started

cleaning the area so there wasn‟t signs of them

being there.

“Dragon, this is Shark,” he said into the

headset.

“Go ahead Shark,” Glenn replied from the

headset.

“Shark is heading back into the water,”

Eddie said into the headset.



321

“Copy Shark back in the water. Dragon is

filling the tub again. Meet you at the bat cave,”

Glenn replied from the headset.

“Copy bat cave and tub being filled,” Eddie

replied then shoved the headset back into the

radio.

“Okay, let‟s move out. Kirk is on point,”

Eddie told his squad.

The Cong Crushers gathered up their M-16s

and headed through the jungle with Kirk leading

the way. Michael and Bruce stayed in the

middle of the pack.



Two hours had passed and Squad 2 made it

to the area they called the “Bat Cave.”

Squad 4 arrived ten mi nutes ago and waited

for Squad 2.

Eddie, Glenn, Ralph, and Randy had a little

huddle to prepare for their attack of the village.

A few minutes later, Eddie walked away with

Ralph.

“Okay squad two, here‟s the plan,” Eddie

said while he walked up to his troops.

“Here‟s the plan,” Glenn said when he

walked over to his troops.





322

A few minutes later, the two squads of Cong

Crushers were ready to head to attack the VC

camp from the right and left flanks.

Squad 2 went off to the left while Squad 4

went off to the right.



Michael and Bruce cautiously trekked

through the jungle with Squad 2 while they got

closer to the VC camp.



Fifteen minutes later, Eddie stopped his

squad behind some large bushes.

He peeked over the top and saw that the VC

camp was dark and quiet. The campfire from

last night was nothing but smothering ashes. It

appeared they were all in their small grass huts

still asleep.

“Lock and load. We‟re going in,” Eddie

quietly told his troops then looked at Michael

and Bruce. “I want you two to stay here and

hide in these bushes. Shoot any VC that come

your way,” he told the two pilots.

Michael and Bruce nodded that they

understood their orders.

Eddie used hand signals to instruct his

troops to quietly head out to the camp.



323

His troops nodded that they understood his

signals.

Michael and Bruce watched while Eddie and

the rest of the Cong Crushers quietly snuck

away from the bushes.

Michael and Bruce ducked down by the

bushes.

“We‟re all alone out here in the jungle. The

Vietnam jungle,” Michael quietly told Bruce.

Bruce nodded in agreement that he felt the

same way.

They sat and remained perfectly quiet while

they looked around for any signs of VC.





After a few minutes of sitting by the bushes,

the sound of M-16 gunfire was heard coming

from the VC camp.

“I guess our Cong Crushers are kicking ass

right now,” Bruce quietly told Michael while the

sound of more M-16 gunfire was heard.

Michael nodded in agreement while he kept

a vigil on the jungle for any VC.

Then the sound of AK-47 gunfire was heard

blending in with the sounds of the M-16 gunfire.

They heard someone scream. It sounded

like one of the Cong Crushers.



324

The sound of AK-47 gunfire mixed with the

sounds of M-16 gunfire was heard for a few

more minutes.



Then the jungle got quiet. It was an eerie

quiet where the critters all scattered.

Michael and Bruce started to get scared

over the sudden disappearance of the gunfire

sounds.

“Do you think?” Bruce asked Michael while

he cautiously looked around for signs of any life.

“I don‟t want to think about that,” Michael

said while he looked around the area for signs of

life.

The snap sound of someone stepping on a

twig was heard behind Michael and Bruce.

For a few seconds, Michael forgot how to

fire the AK-47 since he was scared the VC was

sneaking up behind them.

Michael and Bruce quietly turned around

and peeked above the bush. They both looked

relieved when they saw Eddie and the seven

Cong Crushers walking through the jungle.

Willie assisted Louis walk since he took a bullet

in his right thigh.

Eddie and the Cong Crushers walked back

over to Michael and Bruce.



325

“It looks like a success,” Michael said when

he noticed they all survived.

“Those fucking intel igence idiots

miscalculated the number of VC. We did not

find twenty-five like they estimated. We only

found eight,” Eddie said while he sat down in the

dirt to rest.

The other Cong Crushers sat down in the

dirt.

The sound of more twigs snapping was

heard.

Eddie did not appear concerned over that

sound.

Michael was ready to fire his AK-47 thinking

it was VC.

Then Glenn and his squad of Cong

Crushers walked up to Squad 2.

“Those intel igence guys fucked up again,”

he said while he sat down near Eddie.

Eddie nodded in agreement while he

removed his canteen and took a quick drink.

“I‟l call Papa Bear,” Glenn said then he got

up and walked over to Sam who removed the

radio backpack off his back.

Glenn removed the headset. “Pappa Bear,

this is Dragon,” he said into the headset.



326

“Go head Dragon,” Sarge relied from the

headset.

“Dragon and Shark completed cleaning the

Big Bad Wolf. There was a low count in the

camp. Intel goof,” Glenn replied.

“Copy. Head to landing zone Hawk. Will

give you ride home tomorrow morning,” Sarge

replied from the headset.

“Copy Hawk tomorrow,” Glenn responded

then shoved the headset back into the radio

backpack.

“We‟l get a ride home from landing zone

Hawk tomorrow,” Glenn said while he sat back

down next to Eddie.

“We‟l rest for a few more minutes, then

head out of here,” Eddie said.

Glenn nodded in agreement then he glanced

over at Michael and Bruce. He spotted their AK-

47s. “I see you two were ready for action.”

“Yeah,” Michael replied while he patted his

machine gun but deep down inside, he was glad

he did not have to shoot someone. He really

was not sure he could kill another human being.



Meanwhile, about five miles away, thirty VC

were camped in the jungle.



327

A young male VC old shoved the headset of

a PRC-10 radio into the backpack. This was

one that was stolen from LZ Lola.

The young VC soldier heard the entire

transmission between Glenn and the Sarge.

“They‟ll be a landing zone Hawk tomorrow,”

he told an older VC soldier in Vietnamese.

The older VC soldier removed a folded map

from his shirt. He opened it up and glanced at it.

He saw a spot marked for LZ Hawk and marks

for the entire landing zones used by the Crusher

Hueys. Having spies on the inside of LZ Lola

paid off for the VC.

“We head that way,” he replied to the young

VC soldier in Vietnamese while he pointed.

“Let‟s go,” the younger VC yel ed in

Vietnamese at other VC soldiers, which were

made up of young men and women.

The other VC got up out of the dirt and

started gathering up their AK-47s and

equipment.



Back five miles away, Eddie and Glenn

started moving their squads through the jungle

while they headed in the direction of LZ Hawk.





328

It was a quiet ten hour trek through the

jungle for Squads 2 and 4s.

They found a spot that was two miles from

LZ Hawk and decided to camp there for the

night. Everybody was exhausted and just

wanted to relax and catch up on their sleep.

After their MCI dinners, some of the Cong

Crushers started dozing off while some played

cards and some smoked their Marlboro‟s.

Eddie and Glenn talked to their troops and

paired everybody up for their two-hour guard

shifts.

Michael was paired up with Willie with their

shift starting at two in the morning.



It was ten that night and all the Cong

Crushers were sound asleep. Bruce was paired

up with Ken for their two-hour guard shift.



Michael slept for an hour then woke up.

He fell back asleep for another hour then

woke up.

He fell back asleep and slept for two more

hours.



Two o‟clock rol ed around and Michael was

sound asleep. But he felt something crawling



329

across his leg during his dream while he sat on

the beach back in California.

This crawling sensation woke Michael up

and he glanced down at his legs. His eyes

widened in fear when he saw a large snake

slither across his shins. He was frozen with fear

knowing that Vietnam was filled with deadly

poisonous snakes.

Michael heard a whack sound and the snake

stopped slithering across his legs.

“Got the slimy bastard,” Willie said while he

picked up the headless snake off of Michael‟s

legs.

Michael glanced up and saw Willie holding

the headless snake in his hand. “Thanks.”

“My pleasure,” Willie replied then tossed the

dead snake into the jungle. “Time for our shift,”

he added while he put his machete away.

Michael got up then quickly scanned the

area for more snakes. The coast was clear. He

got up and grabbed his AK-47 off the ground.

Willie walked over and leaned against a

tree. He started scanning the jungle over for

signs of the VC.

While Michael walked around, he watched

his every step in the dirt for signs of more

snakes.



330

It was going to be a long two-hour guard

shift with Michael worried about running across

some more snakes.



331





Chapter 25


Four in the morning arrived and Eddie and

Glenn started waking up their troops.



After thirty minutes of relieving themselves

on the vegetation and eating their MCI

breakfasts, Squads 2 and 4 Cong Crushers

were ready to head out into the jungle.

Glenn grabbed the radio headset from the

PVT Sam‟s backpack. “Pappa Bear, this is

Dragon,” he said into the headset.

“Go ahead Dragon,” Sarge replied from the

headset.

“Dragon and Shark are heading out to

Cobra. Be there in three for our ride home,”

Glenn said into the headset.

“Safe travels and your taxis while be there in

four,” the voice replied from the headset.

“Let‟s roll,” Glenn told everybody while he

shoved the headset back into Sam‟s backpack.

All the Cong Crushers were ready with their

Rucksacks on their back and M-16s in hand.

They two squads of Cong Crushers started

their trek through the jungle.



332



Meanwhile, five miles away, the thirty VC

soldiers ran through the jungle and headed in

the direction toward landing zone Cobra.



Three hours had passed and Cong Crushers

Squads 2 and 4 were about one hundred yards

from landing zone Cobra.

Eddie and Glenn stopped their men in the

jungle. They were relieved that they had a

chance to rest and knew it would be an hour

before their rides arrived.

Glenn grabbed the headset from the radio

pack. “Pappa Bear, Dragon and Shark arrived

at Cobra. Orange will mark the spot,” he said

into the headset.

“Copy Dragon. Be there in one,” Sarge

replied from the headset.

Glenn placed the headset back into Sam‟s

backpack. “One hour so smoke em if you got

em,” he said while he walked away from Sam.

Some bullets zinged and took out some

vegetation within one foot of the Cong Crushers.

While it took a few seconds for them to

realize they were under attack, more bullets

zinged around the Cong Crushers.



333

Nick dropped to the ground dead with a

bullet hole right through his heart.

“Get down!” Glenn yelled at the Cong

Crushers.

The Cong Crushers immediately hit the dirt

with some of them spitting out their cigarettes.

Some dove into a nearby ditch.

Some hid behind some downed logs.

Some hid behind some trees.

AK-47 bullets from the VC zinged all around

the area where the Cong Crushers hid.

Glenn scampered over to Sam. He grabbed

the radio headset out of the backpack.

“Pappa Bear, this is Dragon. Landing zone

Cobra is now hot. I repeat. Cobra is now hot,”

he yelled into the headset while bullets zinged

over his head.

“Understand. We‟l send help,” Sarge

replied from the headset.

Glenn saw Nick in the dirt on his back. He

scampered over to the fallen private. He felt

Nick‟s neck and couldn‟t find a pulse. “Fuck!” he

said knowing the young man was dead.

“I see the bastards,” Louis yelled out the

second he spotted four VC silhouettes trekking

through the jungle and headed in their direction.



334

Six of the Cong Crushers started firing their

M-16s into the jungle when they saw the

silhouettes of the VC coming after them.

“We got more,” Eddie yelled out when he

spotted five more VC silhouettes trekking

through the jungle and headed in their direction.

Three VC dropped down the ground dead.

It was a musical song of M-16s and AK-47

exchanging bullets with each other. Michael and

Bruce fired their AK-47s at the approaching VC.

“We‟re going to be out numbered very

soon,” Ralph yelled out the second he saw

twelve more VC trekking through the jungle.

Glenn scampered over to Sam. He

snatched the headset out of the radio backpack.

“Pappa Bear, Dragon and Shark are going to be

overtaken. We‟re going to retreat. Cobra might

be too hot for a ride home. VC coming from the

west,” he yel ed in a panic into the headset.

“Understand Dragon. Move to the east side

of Cobra. We‟ll cook the bastards,” Sarge

replied from the headset.

“Copy east of Cobra,” Glenn replied then

shoved the headset back into the radio

backpack.

Glenn scampered over to Eddie who just

kil ed a VC. “We‟re supposed to head over to



335

the east side of Cobra. They‟re going to cook

the bastards,” he told Eddie.

“Let‟s use some smoke for our cover,” Eddie

replied to Glenn who nodded in agreement.

Eddie quietly told his troop near him of the

plan.

Glenn scampered back over to his nearest

troops.

Word quietly spread amongst the Cong

Crushers.

All of the Cong Crushers removed smoke

grenades from their Rucksacks and threw them

in the direction of the oncoming VC.

The jungle was soon full of smoke and the

VC was not visible.

The two squads of Cong Crushers jumped

up and started running toward LZ Cobra.

Ralph grabbed Nick by his boots and

dragged him through the jungle.

Willie assisted Louis since he was wounded

in the thigh.

While the Cong Crushers ran through the

field called LZ Cobra, the VC made it through

the smoke. They ran to the beginning of LZ

Cobra and saw the Cong Crushers in the middle

of the field. They started firing their AK-47s.



336

Bullets zinged all around the Cong Crushers

while they ran through the field.

“Fuck!” Craig yelled out when a bullet when

through the back of his right knee. He dropped

to the grass in pain. “Ahhhh!” he screamed out

while he lay on his side in the fetal position

holding his knee.

Michael was near him so he ran over. He

grabbed Craig by his right arm and pulled up.

Michael assisted Craig while they ran

through the field.

When the Cong Crushers got to the east

side of the landing zone, the sounds of

approaching F-5 jets were heard.

That sound made the VC stop dead in their

tracks while they ran through the field.

The Cong Crushers ran into the jungle.

“Dragon, this is your savior in the sky.

Where do you want it?” the voice of Captain

Tom Worsley a F-5 pilot said from the headset.

Glenn snatched the headset out of the radio

backpack from Sam. “The middle and west side

of Cobra. We have VC in the field now. We‟re

safe in the jungle to the east,” Glenn replied.

“To the middle and west side of Cobra. You

got it,” Captain Worsley replied from the

headset.



337

From the jungle, the Cong Crushers

watched while the VC tried to run back into the

jungle, as they knew that an approaching F5 jet

meant.

Two F-5 jets were screeching down toward

the west side of LZ Cobra.

It did not take them long to drop the Napalm

along the west side of the landing zone. The

jungle and west side of the landing zone was

now on fire. Screams of the VC could be heard

in the huge flames.

The two F-5 jets ascended, banked to the

right, and were soon gone.

“Pappa Bear, Dragon and Shark need a new

location for our ride home,” Glenn said into the

headset.

“Head to Stallion. I repeat, head to LZ

Stallion,” Sarge replied from the headset.

“Copy Stallion. We‟ll be there in five. We

have one dead. Private Cole. We‟l leave him

here on the east side of Cobra,” Glenn replied.

“Copy, we‟ll have him picked him up when

they come in for a body count,” Sarge replied

from the headset.

Glenn shoved the headset back into the

radio backpack of Sam.



338

“We‟re moving to LZ Stallion,” Glenn told

Eddie who walked over to get the updated plan.



Fifteen minutes had passed and the Cong

Crushers were ready to head out to LZ Stallion.

They left Cole‟s dead body in the landing

zone with his helmet stuck on the top of a cross

they made out of sticks.

The two squads of Cong Crushers started

their trek through the jungle thinking the worst of

their mission was over.



Meanwhile, west of LZ Cobra, twelve VC,

that included three women, walked upon the

scorched area.

They saw the burnt remains of their fallen

comrades and some of them started crying.

Others were pissed.

They started walking away in the direction

that the two squads of Cong Crushers headed.

They had another PRC-10 backpack radio and

heard the transmission Glenn made a little while

ago.

The VC walked around the field of LZ Cobra.

When they got to the east side of LZ Cobra,

they found Cole‟s dead body.



339

After they stared at Cole‟s motionless body,

the VC split into two groups of six.

One group went off to the right when they

entered the jungle.

The other group went off the left when they

entered the jungle.



340





Chapter 26


Three hours had passed and Eddie and

Glenn stopped the Cong Crushers.

“Let‟s take a fifteen minute break. Smoke

em if you got em,” Eddie told the Cong

Crushers.

All the Cong Crushers placed their M-16s on

the ground and sat down.

Some just kicked back and closed their eyes

for a quick power nap.

Some lit up their Marlboro cigarettes and

puffed away.

Some took a drink of water from their

canteen.

It just felt so good to sit down especially

since the jungle was quiet.



Five minutes had passed and the jungle was

still quiet except for the songs of the critters.

Sam stood up and walked over to an area

for a little privacy. He unzipped his fatigue pants

and started peeing on the vegetation. He

finished then zipped up his pants.



341

The sound of gunfire from a single AK-47

was heard.

Numerous bullets penetrated Sam‟s chest

area. One bullet went through his heart and

Sam didn‟t know what hit him when he dropped

dead to the dirt.

More bullets from more AK-47s started flying

at the Cong Crushers.

“Fuck!” Glenn yelled out while he hit behind

a tree.

The Cong Crushers started returning fire

back in the direction of the AK-47 fire.

Michael and Bruce fired their AK-47s at the

VC.

Eddie scampered over to Glenn.

“Let‟s find a safer area to shoot from,” Eddie

quietly told Glenn.

Glenn nodded in agreement then made

some hand signals to his nearby troops that they

were moving out.

Eddie also made hand signals to his nearby

troops that they were moving out.

After a few seconds, the Cong Crushers

threw some more smoke grenades in the

direction of the advancing VC.

The jungle started filling up with smoke.



342

The Cong Crushers got up from the dirt and

hauled ass through the jungle. Michael and

Bruce were again in the middle of the pack.



The VC cautiously walked through the

smoke looking for the Cong Crushers.

The Cong Crushers with Michael and Bruce

ran over to an area with a long ditch. It was a

perfect place for their cover.

Michael and Bruce jumped into the ditch

with the other Cong Crushers.

“How the fuck are these bastards learning

where we are?” Eddie said while he looked

baffled.

“Beats the fuck out of me,” Ralph said while

he peeked out of the ditch for signs of the VC.

“They‟re about fifty yards to our eleven

o‟clock position,” Glenn said the second he

spotted four VC sneaking through the jungle.

The rest of the Cong Crushers looked to the

eleven o‟clock position and spotted the four VC.

They started firing their M-16s.

The four VC dropped dead to the dirt.

The jungle was void of any VC.



Five minutes had passed and the jungle

remained quiet.



343

“I think it‟s now safe,” Randy called out.

“Let‟s move out to Stallion,” Eddie said to

Glenn who nodded his head in agreement.

Eddie and Glenn signaled to the other Cong

Crushers that it was time to move out.

Everybody cautiously got out of the ditch.

They headed out through the jungle thinking

the VC might have turned tail and ran away.

Michael this time assisted Louis since his

right thigh was killing him the bullet wound.



The Cong Crushers walked through the

jungle for another fifteen minutes. It was still

quiet and the threat of more VC did not appear

to be high risk.

Then all of a sudden the sound of AK-47

gunfire from the VC filled the air.

“Fuck! Not again!” Glenn yelled out knowing

the VC was back.

The Cong Crushers hit the dirt and tried to

find the location of the VC.

Louis slumped downward pulling Michael to

the dirt.

The sound of more AK-47 gunfire filled the

air but this time it came from another location.



344

Louis slumped lower and Michael could not

hold on any longer. He let Louis drop to the

ground.

Michael looked down and saw that

Louis had been hit in the neck and was

bleeding profusely.

Michael dropped to his knees and stared at

Louis. He was clueless on what to do.

Louis started gasping for air and blood

oozed out of his mouth. Louis stopped gasping

for air. His body went limp and he had a blank

star. He was dead.

Michael knelt in the dirt and was stunned at

the sight of Louis dead in the dirt.

The sound of more AK-47 gunfire was heard

with the exchanging sound M-16 gunfire. But

this time, the VC was coming from the right and

left of the Cong Crushers.

“We better get the fuck of here!” Glenn

yelled out.

All the Cong Crushers stood up and fired

their M-16s in the direction of the advancing VC.

They all started running in a direction they

felt was safe.

Bullets from the VC zinged all around the

Cong Crushers while they ran through the

jungle.



345

The Cong Crushers ran for a few minutes

when all of a sudden, ten more VC appeared out

from behind some trees.

The VC started firing their AK-47s at the

Cong Crushers that scattered in the jungle for

cover.

Most of the Cong Crushers ducked behind

cover.

“I‟m hit,” Willie yelled out while he dropped

to the ground as he did not make it to a downed

tree. He looked down at a bullet hole through

his left thigh and felt relieved it was only a leg

wound.

Then he looked up and saw a VC walking up

to him. He could see that it was a female.

“Fuck. I got shot by a girl,” he said while the girl

inched her way closer. Willie whipped his M-16

at her and pressed the trigger. His M-16 was

jammed. “Fuck!” he said realizing he was a

dead duck. He frantically tried to free the jam

but it wasn‟t working. “Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!” he

called out, as he did not want to be killed by a

girl.

The female VC walked up closer to Willie

and aimed her M-16 at him.

Willie closed his eyes and silently prayed.



346

Michael was ten feet away from Willie and

saw the female VC ready to shoot. Then

Michael‟s eyes widened in shock when he got a

good glimpse of the female VC. “Kim? Is that

you?” he called out while he got up out of the dirt

and walked over to her.

The female VC looked over at Michael when

she recognized his voice. It was Kim.

“Michael,” she replied with a smirk.

The VC and Cong Crushers exchanged

gunfire while Michael walked over to Kim.

“What are you doing?” Michael asked while

he walked over to her and was confused.

Willie opened his eyes and glanced up at

Kim. Then it dawned on him. “It the hooch girl,”

he said in shock. “Fucking bitch.”

His last comment pissed off Kim. She shot

her M-16 and put another bullet in Willie‟ left

thigh.

“Ahhhh!” Willie screamed out in pain and

grabbed his thigh.

“What are you doing? You can‟t be VC?”

Michael said while he stopped four feet from

Kim.

“Me VC,” Kim replied while she aimed her

M-16 at Willie‟s head.



347

Willie closed his eyes again anticipated what

it would feel like when that bullet goes through

his brain.

“Did you steal that M-16 from us?” Michael

asked but knew the answer.

Kim looked over at Michael with a smirk and

lowered her M-16. “Me steal M-16. Me steal

radios. Me steal American money,” she replied

and had an evil look in her eyes that Michael

never saw before.

“Kil the bitch,” Willie cried out at Michael.

Kim aimed her M-16 at Wil ie‟s head again.

“He no kil me. He love me. He wants to marry

me. He like fucking me long time,” Kim said with

a smirk.

Michael saw the fear in Willie eyes. Then

Michael saw the hatred in Kim‟s eyes. He

moved his AK-47 up and aimed it at Kim.

She saw Michael. “You steal our rifle?” she

asked him.

“Don‟t shoot him and I won‟t shoot you,”

Michael told her.

Kim looked at Michael. “You ugly friend with

red hair,” she said.

“Kevin?”

“Yes. I kill him,” Kim replied with a smirk

while she reached inside her top and showed a



348

gold high school class ring that hung off a thin

gold chain.

Michael was in shock as he knew that was

Kevin‟s ring. “You cut off his finger?”

Kim just gave Michael a smirk while she

aimed her M-16 back at Wil ie‟s head.

Michael was furious and fired his AK-47 at

Kim.

Kim looked stunned when she realized five

bullets penetrated her chest area. She got

pissed and turned her M-16 at Michael. She

fired off a round.

One of those bullets hit Michael in his right

shoulder. He looked at her in disbelief when the

pain of the bullet shot through his shoulder.

Michael got furious. He quickly reacted and

fired his AK-47 and pelted Kim‟s face with

bullets.

She dropped dead to the dirt after numerous

bullets disfigured her face. It was a bloody pulp.

“No!” a male Vietnamese voice cried out

pissed from behind Michael.

Michael turned around and was shocked

again. “Shit. It‟s the fucking barber. Are they al

VC?” he said the second he saw Hein the barber

from LZ Lola standing there with a M-16 in hand.

His instincts took over and Michael immediately



349

fired his AK-47 at Hein who dropped dead to the

dirt.

Then Hao the bartender from Party Place

Two showed up from behind a tree.

“I don‟t fucking believe it,” Michael yelled out

remembering how nice Hao was when he

bartended.

Hao aimed his AK-47 at Michael and fired

off a shot.

Michael reacted quickly and fired his AK-47

at Hao.

A bullet hit Michael in his right arm.

Hao dropped dead to the ground with few

bullets in his forehead.

The exchange of AK-47 and M-16 gunfire

ceased in the jungle. It was again quiet.

Michael was in pain when he walked over to

Willie.

Michael extended and offered Willie his left

hand.

Willie grabbed Michael‟s hand.

Michael and assisted him up on his good

leg.

They both looked down at Kim.

“I‟m sorry about her being VC. I know you

loved her,” Willie said while he placed his arm

around Michael‟s shoulder.



350

“Fuck the bitch,” Michael replied and

sounded pissed. But deep inside, he was

hurting about losing the girl he loved so very

much.

He bent down grabbed the thin gold chain.

He pulled hard and it broke away from Kim‟s

dead neck. He removed Kevin‟s ring and tucked

it away in one of his flight suit pockets. .

“She was a sick bitch,” Wil ie said while he

knew that ring must have been Kevin‟s.

“Let‟s get the fuck out of here,” Michael told

Willie while he stood up.

Michael helped Willie walk over to Eddie

who stood fifty feet away with Mark. Eddie

talked into the radio headset providing LZ Lola

with an update of their situation.

Willie hopped on one leg while Michael

helped him walk to Eddie.

They were both in pain while they headed

toward Eddie.

They walked upon a dead VC in the dirt.

They walked upon another dead VC in the

dirt.

They heard the cries of someone in pain.

They soon walked upon Kirk who lay in the

dirt by a fallen tree.

“You okay Kirk?” Willie asked.



351

“I fell. I think I got shot in my left leg. I can‟t

look. The sight of blood makes me weak,” Kirk

cried out in pain and was afraid to look down.

Michael and Willie looked at Kirk‟s legs and

saw his femur bone from his left thigh poking out

from being snapped.

“You just broke your leg,” Michael said.

“I broke my leg?” Kirk replied and looked a

little relived he was not shot looked down and

saw his femur bone poking out of his thigh. He

got white as a ghost and passed out.

“Wimpy white boys, Willie said with a light

chuckle.

Michael chuckled and then they walked

away and headed over to Eddie and Mark.

Eddie looked at Michael and Willie and saw

their wounds.

Ralph walked over to Eddie.

Glenn walked over to Eddie.

Randy walked over with Oscar, and Arnie.

“I‟m missing Kirk,” Eddie said.

“He‟s back there with a broken leg,” Willie

replied and pointed in the direction he and

Michael walked.

Michael looked around. “Where‟s Bruce my

X-Ray?” he asked.

“He‟s dead,” Ralph replied.



352

Michael looked sadden over losing another

friend.

“Okay, let‟s gather up out dead and injured

and head to LZ Mustang.

Michael and Willie sat down while the

surviving Cong Crushers went to gather up the

injured and dead.

“Hey man, thanks for saving my life back

there. I thought that bitch was going to kill me,”

Willie said and struck out his hand.

“No problem,” Michael replied then shook

Willie hand.

They waited for the other Cong Crushers to

return.



353





Chapter 27


An hour later, the surviving Cong Crushers

brought all the dead and injured Crushers over

to a spot in the jungle by LZ Stallion.

Michael sat in the dirt with Willie and Kirk,

who had a two tree braces tied to his broken leg

to act as splints. They glanced over at their

buddies that lay lifeless in the dirt. They were

sorry their friends died, but they were also glad

they were still alive. But they also wondered

why they survived.

Michael started thinking about Kim. At one

second, he missed and loved her. The n for

another second, he could not believe she shot

him. He also could not believe he was blinded

by love and that she was VC and used him.

Then he started hating her and was glad she

was dead.

Eddie walked over after talking with Glenn

about his talk with LZ Lola on the radio.

“Lola is sending some other unit here to pick

us up. The Vipers from LZ Snake Pit will be

coming in,” Eddie said then opened up his

canteen and took a drink of water.



354

“Aren‟t they assault ships?” Michael asked.

Eddie nodded in agreement while he took

his drink of water. “Yeah, but they‟re closer at

the moment,” Eddie replied then handed his

canteen over to Michael.

Michael took a drink of water. “Thanks,” he

said then handed the canteen back to Eddie.

Ralph walked over to Eddie with a PRC-10

backpack radio in hand.

“I found this on the back of one of the dead

VC,” Ralph said while he walked over to Eddie

and showed him the radio.

“Plus they also had some M-16s,” Glenn

said while he held up three of them.

“Fucking figures,” Eddie replied and was

pissed that the VC penetrated the LZ Lola.

“We also found our barber and bartender

among the dead VC,” Randy told Eddie.

“They must have been stealing our M-16s

and radio,” Eddie concluded.

“Some female VC bitch got it in the face. I

don‟t believe they have dental records to identify

her because she‟s a fucking mess,” Glenn

added.

Michael glanced over at Willie.



355

Willie winked indicating he would not tell

them about Kim being VC since Michael saved

his life.



After a few minutes of waiting in the jungle,

the sound of approaching Viper Hueys was

heard in the sky. It was the sweetest music a

soldier could here at this moment.

Oscar walked back into the jungle after

setting off an orange smoke bomb to signal the

approaching Vipers.

“Get the wounded on board first,” Eddie

yelled out while the whop whop sound of the

approaching Hueys got louder.

Oscar walked over with Arnie to Michael and

Willie.

They assisted Willie up to their feet.

Michael got up by himself.

Oscar and Arnie walked PFC Willie to the

landing zone.

Michael tagged behind them.

They watched while a Huey descended

down to the middle of LZ Mustang.

When the Huey got closer, they saw that it

was Viper 15.

The second Viper 15 touched down, Oscar

and Arnie rushed Willie to the Huey.



356

Michael rushed behind them.

Ralph and Randy carried Kirk over to Viper

15.

Oscar and Arnie placed Willie into the cargo

of the Huey.

Michael climbed up inside the Huey.

Ralph and Randy placed Kirk inside the

Huey.

They all rushed away.

Viper 15 lifted up off the ground.

Viper 8 descended and landed on the

ground.

Vipers 2 and 3 were descending down to the

LZ.

While Viper 15 ascended up into the sky,

Michael looked at the pilot and copilot. His eyes

widened with joy when a the face of X-Ray

looked familiar.

“Eric, is that you?” Michael cal ed out.

Eric Wilson, Michael‟s old buddy from his

Fort Wolters and Fort Rucker days looked back

at Michael. His eyes widened with joy the

second he saw his old friend.

“Wel Michael, fancy meeting you here,” Eric

cal ed out. “How bad are you hurt?”

“Just shoulder and arm wounds. I‟ll live,”

Michael replied.



357

“Wel , I guess you‟ll get to go back to the

states now,” Eric called out.

“Yeah, I guess. So, when did you make it to

Nam?” Michael asked.

“Three weeks ago,” Eric replied.

Michael smiled happy to see an old friend,

but he was worried Eric would find the same fate

as Kevin.

“I haven‟t heard from you in a while,” said

Michael.

“Sorry about that. I got mixed up with some

sweet Georgia pussy. She dumped me so I

came here,” Eric replied.

“Oh,” said Michael while he closed his eyes,

as he needed some rest.

It was a quiet ride in Viper 15 while it flew

back to LZ Lola.



Viper 15 landed back at LZ Lola where

Michael, Willie and Kirk were immediately taken

into the medical tent.

Eric went with Michael to the medical tent

while his Huey was being refueled.

Eric could not stay long and had few

minutes to chat with Michael. They ag reed to

meet back in the states.



358

While Michael was being prepped to be

flown to Cam Rahn, Eric jumped back inside

Viper 15.

Eric lifted his Huey off the ground and flew

back to his home base.



The next day, Harrington questioned

Michael after he found out that the barber and

bartender were VC.

Michael confessed that he learned that Kim

was VC while out in the jungle. He swore he did

not know she was VC when she was here in LZ

Lola. Michael told Harrington that he killed Kim

during the last battle.

Willie was also questioned and backed up

Michael‟s story. Willie told Harrington that

Michael saved his life by killing Kim before she

killed him.

Since Harrington always thought highly of

Michael and he did not want to deal with the

paperwork for a formal investigation. He trusted

Michael and it would be long forgotten.



The next day, Michael was flown to Cam

Rahn along with Willie and Kirk.

They were admitted to the base hospital

there and received additional medical treatment.



359



While he stayed in the hospital, Michael saw

that familiar old face. Vinny was there and was

recuperating from having his left leg amputated

at the knee thanks to a sneaky VC. Vinny had

plans to put in his retirement papers. Those

earlier years of Infantry training at Fort Bragg

and then being in actual combat changed his

tune to life in the Army. He just had to figure out

what he could do for a living with only one leg.

But he was determined not to let this ruin the

rest of his life.



Michael was flown back to LZ Lola two days

later to finish out the rest of his days in Vietnam.

One of the first things Michael did the second he

arrived back at LZ Lola, was to toss those Ho

Chi Minh racing slicks into a burning barrel of

shit. He wanted nothing to remind him of Kim

Ly.

Then while Michael went inside Party Palace

Two for some much needed beers, he learned

that Crusher 3 was shot down two days ago.

Crazy Jay was killed while Jerry lost his right leg

below the knee. They both were due to leave

Vietnam a week after their crash.

Michael spent hours drinking.



360



Three weeks later, Michael was back in the

states for three weeks of leave. His mother

Elaine cried with joy that her son came back

from Vietnam alive and without missing limbs.

While he was home, Michael paid some

visits to Kevin‟s gravesite. He deeply missed his

childhood friend and fond memories flooded his

head.

Michael also got orders to Fort Rucker in

Alabama. He spent the last of his Army

enlistment as a flight instructor training other

young men for combat flying in Vietnam.

While he celebrated 1970 rolling in

Enterprise, Alabama, he wondered what his old

buddies from Nam were doing at this moment.



After his enlistment was over, Michael

returned back to Glendale, California. Elaine

and Harry Grayson were so happy that their son

home for good.

While he was home, he hooked up with

Marty Abbott. Harry loved Marty‟s cartooning

talent and got him a job with Disney as an

animator.





361

A month after he got home, Michael got a

job flying helicopters with the Los Angeles Police

department.



Two months later, Eric Wilson was out of the

Army and he also landed a job flying helicopters

for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Michael loved seeing his old Army buddy

again and this time, they could fly together under

friendlier skies.



Two months later, Michael met Katie

Henderson a pretty brunette that worked as a

secretary for Warner Brothers. He fell in love

again. They planned on getting married in four

months. Elaine and Harry could not wait to have

some grandchildren.

Michael was happy with his new life, but at

times the experiences of Vietnam would haunt

him a little during the night. He would never talk

about his experiences in that war with his family.



Then 2012 rolled around and Kevin retired

from the LAPD. He had enough of flying

helicopters for the past forty-fours years. He

now wanted to spend time with his six young

grandkids.



362



In June of 2013, Michael and Katie took a

trip east and visited Washington, D.C.

They visited the Vietnam Memorial Wall.

This was hard for Michael while he searched

up and down at the engraved names.

He found Albert Biannotti‟s name. “We

arrived at Landing Zone Lola at the same time,”

he told Katie while he ran a finger across

Albert‟s name.

Then searched up and down the wall and

found Chuck Calhoun‟s name.

“He went by the name C Squared. He was

our crew chief and kept Alan‟s Huey in tip top

shape,” he told Katie while he ran a finger

across C Square‟s name.

He searched up and down the wall and

found Jay Granger‟s name. He chuckled while

he ran a finger across Crazy Jay‟s name. He

then proceeded to tell Katie about the old rice

farmer crapping in the dike story and then how

Crazy Jay would fly low next to Army truck and

flash his “God Bless” sign at them from his

cockpit door window. She loved that story.

He searched up and down the wall and

found Ernie Joel‟s name.



363

“He was the first soldier I saw die. We were

in a bunker and the LZ was under attack. I

never got the chance to know him. As I just

arrived there. The attack was at night,” he told

Katie while he ran a finger across Ernie Joel‟s

name.

He searched up and down the wall and

found Louis Medina‟s name. He ran a finger

across Louis‟ name. “Went my Huey got shot

down, and I was in the jungle with the guys,

Louis was wounded in the leg. We were

heading to another landing zone to be picked up

when more VC attacked us. Louis got shot in

the neck while I was helping him walk,” Michael

told Katie while the memory of that day was vivid

in his mind. His eyes started to well up.

Michael searched up and down the wall then

he stopped when he found Alan Rathburn‟s

name. “I was his copilot when I first got to the

LZ Lola,” Katie told him. “He was a good guy

and I learned a lot from him,” he added while he

ran a finger across Alan‟s name.

Katie was surprised he finally opened up

and started talking about those days.

Michael searched up and down the wall and

found Bruce Tolison‟s name. He ran a finger

across his name. “He was my copilot of my



364

Huey. He was killed after my Huey was shot

down,” he told Katie.

Michael searched up and down the wall and

found Chaz White‟s name.

“He was my crew chief when I was the air

commander of my own Huey. He got killed

when we got shot down,” he told Katie while he

ran a finger across Chaz‟s name.



Then Michael tried to remember the names

of some of the other Cong Crushers that were

killed during his stay at LZ Lola. Their names

slipped his mind.

Michael started to walk away from the wall.

“Are you forgetting someone?” Katie asked

while she remained by the wall.

Michael looked back at the wall. “No.”

“Are you sure?” she asked.

Michael stared at the wall. He started to

move back to the wall but stopped. He stared at

the wal then at Katie‟s eyes.

He walked back to the wall and eventually

found Kevin‟s name.

“I wished I knew him. I remember your mom

talking highly of him,” he said while he lightly ran

a finger across Kevin‟s name. “He was my best



365

friend since kindergarten,” Michael said while his

eyes welled up.

Michael stared at Kevin‟s name for a new

more minutes. Then he wiped away his tears,

held Katie‟s hand and they walked away.



366
